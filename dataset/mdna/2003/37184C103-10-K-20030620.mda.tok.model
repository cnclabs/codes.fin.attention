item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market integrated circuits that receive and process digital video and graphic images 
we also supply reference boards and designs that incorporate our proprietary integrated circuits 
we are focused on developing and marketing image processing solutions 
we are currently targeting the flat panel computer monitor market and other potential mass markets 
we market and sell our products through authorized distributors and directly to customers with the support of regional sales representatives 
average selling prices to distributors are typically less than average selling prices to direct customers 
average selling prices and product margins of our products are typically highest during the initial months following product introduction and decline over time and as volume increases 
we also sell finished systems primarily to the high end video market under the faroudja brand 
these products are generally sold through retail channels 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment  other than to distributors where we recognize revenue upon the distributor s shipment to end customers 
we comply with the revenue recognition guidance summarized in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of shipment 
to date we have not experienced any significant product returns 
we also earn revenues from leasing out portions of our premises that are not required for our own operations  and from license fees and royalties 
to date these amounts have not been material 
we have limited ability to reschedule purchase orders to our suppliers and we have to place purchase orders for products before we receive purchase orders from our customers 
this restricts our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products and exposes us to the risk of having either too much or not enough of a particular product 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of inventory held 
for the year ended march   we recorded inventory provisions totaling million 
we have agreements with suppliers in asia such that we are dependent on the suppliers manufacturing yields 
we earn investment tax credits under the provisions of the income tax act canada because we carry out qualifying research and development activities in canada 
these tax credits are earned at a rate of of those qualifying expenditures 
the tax credits earned may only be applied to reduce income taxes payable in canada 
we currently have losses and deductions available to reduce future years taxable income in both canada and the united states 
most of these losses and deductions can be carried forward for periods in excess of seven years  and in some cases  indefinitely 
details of these losses and deductions can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this report 
on may   we merged with paradise electronics  inc  a private company  and adopted a new fiscal year effective april  the merger with paradise was accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
on february   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of sage  inc in exchange for  of our common shares 
sage  a public company  designed  developed and marketed digital display and video processors 
we also assumed the remaining outstanding stock options of sage  which were converted to options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  consisting of our common stock valued at approximately million  our stock options valued at approximately million  and direct acquisition costs estimated at approximately million 
on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets of vm labs  inc  including all patents  trademarks and other intellectual property  for cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the aggregate purchase price  including associated costs  was million 
we won a public auction of those assets that culminated in a federal bankruptcy court proceeding held on february  in connection with that acquisition  we hired former employees of vm labs 
because the date of closing on the purchase of vm labs assets was late in our fiscal year  that acquisition had a negligible impact on our fiscal results of operations 
we accounted for the acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs using the purchase method of accounting 
those acquisitions gave rise to several expenses in fiscal and subsequent periods that were not present in prior years  including in process research and development costs  restructuring expenses and the amortization of acquired intangibles 
for example  we recorded a million charge for in process research and development in fiscal related to the sage acquisition and we have recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  costs resulting from the acquisition of sage related to the amortization of deferred stock compensation are included in research and development and in selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation totaled million in fiscal and  in fiscal we expect that there will be ongoing amortization expense for acquired intangibles and deferred stock based compensation in future years 
further details on these amounts can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with smartasic technology  inc with respect to patent infringement complaints filed by us against smartasic in the us international trade commission and the federal district court of the northern district of california 
the settlement agreement allows smartasic to make limited use of our patented technology as part of our cooperative relationship 
the settlement agreement does not affect ongoing patent infringement complaints we have filed against other companies 
on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with pixelworks  inc  an oregon corporation  and display acquisition corporation  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of pixelworks 
pursuant to the agreement  and subject to its terms and conditions  display will be merged with and into genesis with genesis continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of pixelworks 
as a result of the merger  each issued and outstanding share of genesis common stock  par value per share  will be automatically converted into the right to receive validly issued  fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock  par value per share  of pixelworks 
the consummation of the merger is subject to the approval of the stockholders of genesis and pixelworks  receipt of necessary approvals under united states and applicable foreign antitrust laws  sec clearance and other customary closing conditions 
the merger is intended to be a tax free reorganization under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
all of the directors of genesis who were directors on march  have entered into voting agreements with pixelworks obligating them to vote in favor of adoption of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
as described below  significant estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  and the useful lives of intangible assets 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  prepaid expenses  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer returns and warranty claims based on historical experience 
if actual customer returns or warranty claims increase as a result of future product introductions or changes in product quality  we may be required to recognize additional reductions to revenue 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for valuation reserves against our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we hold minority equity interests in other companies 
we may record an investment impairment charge if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or our inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may be less than an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we provide for costs associated for patent litigation when we believe we have a reasonable basis for estimating those costs 
if actual costs associated with patent litigation differ from our estimates  we may be required to recognize additional costs 
we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill 
these tests are based on numerous assumptions as to potential future results of our business that we consider to be reasonable at the time those assumptions are made 
if any of these assumptions later prove to be incorrect or if we change our assessment as to their reasonability because of changing business conditions  we may record an impairment charge 
from time to time  we incur costs related to potential merger activities 
when we assess that we will be the acquirer for accounting purposes in such transactions and we expect to complete the transaction  direct costs associated with the acquisition are deferred and form part of the final purchase price 
in the event these assessments change  any such deferred costs would be expensed 
costs associated with other merger activities are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by each category of cost or expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated year ended march  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles provision for costs associated with patent litigation restructuring in process research and development total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for recovery of income taxes net income loss total revenues 
total revenues for the year ended march  increased by million to million from total revenues of million in the year ended march   an increase of 
total revenues for the year ended march  increased by million  or  from total revenues of million for the year ended march  the increase in total revenues over the last two fiscal years is primarily because of increased demand for our products in the flat panel monitor market 
revenues of sage  inc are included in our total revenues from the date of acquisition  february  those revenues amounted to million of the increase in total revenues for the year ended march  revenues from the flat panel monitor market increased to million or of total revenues in the year ended march  from million or of total revenues in the year ended march   and from million  or  of total revenues in the year ended march  these increases were a result of increased unit shipments into that market  partially offset by declining average selling prices 
in fiscal our unit shipments increased and our average selling prices declined compared to fiscal in fiscal  our unit shipments increased and our average selling prices declined compared to fiscal the overall year to year growth of unit sales of flat panel monitors is attributable to decreases in their retail selling prices 
this decline was primarily a result of reductions in the cost of lcd panels  which are the most expensive components used in flat panel monitors  resulting from additional manufacturing capacity and improved manufacturing yields for lcd panels 
in fiscal and  retail prices of flat panel computer monitors continued to decline due to competitive pressures  among other factors  increasing overall demand for flat panel computer monitors  however this trend was not uniform throughout those years 
there were shortages of lcd panels in part of calendar  which in turn caused significant increases in lcd panel costs and flat panel monitors before additional supply became available later in the calendar year 
revenue from other markets increased to million in the year ended march   from million in the year ended march  and from million in the year ended march  increases in revenue in these markets in fiscal are primarily attributable to our acquisition of sage  inc in february gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the year ended march   and from million in the year ended march  gross profit represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in the fiscal year and of total revenues in the fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to our average selling prices declining faster than our average manufacturing costs in those years 
the decrease in gross profit percentage in the fiscal year was primarily attributable to costs incurred in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
these costs  which totaled million in that year  included costs attributable to the write down of our prior generation products and initial low manufacturing yield associated with the line buffer sections in one of our products 
million of these costs related to the write down of inventory on hand at march  excluding these costs  our gross margin would have been in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with research and development personnel  development tools and prototyping costs 
research and development expenses for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the year ended march  and from million in the year ended march  these expenses represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in the fiscal year and of total revenues in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars in each year reflects greater personnel costs associated with an expansion in our research and development activities  increased prototype and pre production expenses of new products 
in particular  the increase in expenses in fiscal and to a lesser extent in fiscal result from increased research and development activities following our acquisition of sage  including an increase in non cash stock based compensation charges 
these charges amounted to million in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in expenses as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal resulted from the faster rate of growth in research and development expenses compared to growth in total revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel  commissions and related overhead costs for selling  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management functions 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in the year ended march   million in the year ended march   and million in the year ended march  these expenses represented of total revenues in the fiscal year  of total revenues in the fiscal year and of total revenues in the fiscal year 
the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects increased personnel costs related to increased selling  administrative and customer support activities and increased commissions associated with higher sales volumes  as well as an increase in non cash stock based compensation charges arising from the acquisition of sage of million in fiscal and  in fiscal in addition  in fiscal we incurred million in costs of employee terminations and for professional fees and expenses associated with strategic initiatives that we terminated due to economic and market conditions 
excluding those costs  selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal would have been of total revenues 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income in the year ended march  was  compared with million in the year ended march  and million in the year ended march  the decline in interest income resulted from the decline in prevailing interest rates  offset in part by holding increased cash balances 
future interest income will depend on the amount of funds available to invest and on future interest rates 
in addition  we incurred imputed interest expense on our long term lease liability that was assumed in connection with our acquisition of sage in fiscal this expense amounted to  in fiscal and  in fiscal because we settled the obligation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we do not expect to incur this expense in the future 
provision for recovery of income taxes 
our tax provision is a combination of taxes on income offset by the research and development tax credits earned in canada and the united states 
future income tax provisions will depend on our effective tax rates and the distribution of taxable income between taxation jurisdictions  the amount of research and development performed in canada  and the likelihood of being able to utilize available tax credits or losses 
quarterly results of operations the following table shows our unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the most recent eight quarters reported 
this unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements that are included in item of this report  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information for the periods presented

most of our revenues come from sales of semiconductors to manufacturers of flat panel computer monitors 
in the june quarter  the price of lcd panels increased substantially which reduced demand for flat panel monitors and  in turn  for our products 
sales of semiconductor products to manufacturers of flat panel computer monitors is extremely price competitive 
while we experienced significant increases in our unit volumes in the period june to march  declines in average selling prices  or asps  to a large part offset revenue growth in that time period 
gross margins declined through the september quarter as a result of asps declining at a faster rate than reductions in average product costs 
in the december and march quarters  asps declined at a lower rate than did product costs  resulting in improved gross margins 
research and development expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to fluctuations in staff levels and the timing of non recurring engineering charges related to new product development 
in addition  since the march quarter  these expenses have increased as a result of greater staff levels  resulting from our acquisition of sage and the hiring of former employees of vm labs  and from costs to defend our intellectual property 
selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to increases in staffing levels for sales and customer support activities  and sales commissions 
in addition  since the march quarter  we have had increases in these expenses as a result of increased staff levels resulting from our acquisition of sage 
costs for amortization of acquired intangibles arose from the acquisition of sage and the assets of vm labs in the march quarter 
our results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include those described under the caption risk factors  among others 
any one or more of these factors could result in our failure to achieve our expectations as to future operating results 
our expenditures for research and development  selling  general and administrative functions are based in part on future revenue projections 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated declines in revenues  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce our selling prices in response to competitive pressure or other factors  or to increase spending to pursue new market opportunities or to defend ourselves against lawsuits that may be brought against us 
any decline in average selling prices of a particular product that is not offset by a reduction in product costs  or by sales of other products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross profit and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results or business outlook will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price for our common shares 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at march   million at march   and million at march  cash generated from operations was million for the year ended march  and was million for the year ended march  for the year ended march   cash used by operations was million 
the increase in cash flow from operations for fiscal and compared to the prior years was primarily the result of increased sales volume 
the use of cash by operations in fiscal was largely the result of increased working capital balances  being principally increases in accounts receivable trade and inventory to support a growing sales volume 
in the future we may require a larger inventory of products and increased levels of accounts receivable trade in order to support any expected growth in our business 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended march  and net cash generated by investing activities was million in the year ended march  net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended march  in fiscal  cash was used for the purchase of capital assets resulting from the continued expansion of our business through the development of new products that required additional design tools and for costs associated with our proposed merger with pixelworks  inc the fiscal increase in net cash was primarily provided by the cash and short term investments of million acquired on the purchase of sage  less the acquisition of the assets of vm labs for cash of million 
in fiscal  cash was used for the purchase of capital assets  including investments in leasehold improvements for our facilities in alviso  california and thornhill  ontario 
at march   we have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business and costs associated with our proposed merger with pixelworks 
we currently estimate that those transaction costs will total approximately million  of which million had been incurred to march  net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended march  cash was used primarily for the repurchase of shares of our common stock for million and the repayment of a long term lease obligation for million  offset by amounts received for the purchase of common shares under our stock purchase and stock option plans totaling million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was million  and million for the year ended march  these consisted primarily of amounts received for the purchase of common shares under our stock purchase and stock option plans 
as of march   our principal financial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
these commitments include leases for two premises in the united states  located in sunnyvale and alviso  california  two locations in china and one location in each of canada  india  japan  south korea and taiwan 
in addition we have obligations under operating leases for equipment 
the aggregate estimated annual payments required under our lease obligations by fiscal year  excluding any expected sub lease income  are as follows  in thousands of dollars thereafter our lease agreements expire at various dates through further information on lease obligations and commitments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
since inception we have satisfied our liquidity needs primarily through the sales of equity securities 
we believe that our existing cash balances together with any cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements on a short term basis 
on a long term basis  we may be required to raise additional capital to fund investments in operating assets such as accounts receivable or inventory to assist in the growth of our business  or for capital assets such as land  buildings or equipment 
because we do not have our own semiconductor manufacturing facility  we may be required to make deposits to secure supply in the event there is a shortage of manufacturing capacity in the future 
although we currently have no plans to raise additional funds for such uses  we could be required or could elect to seek to raise additional capital in the future 
in addition  from time to time we evaluate acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement our business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or require the issuance of equity securities that may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders 
risk factors a number of our statements in this form k  including those concerning our anticipated revenues  gross profit margins  amortization of intangibles and stock based compensation  liquidity and business strategy  are forward looking and subject to various known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the risks described below  elsewhere in this report and in the documents that we have incorporated by reference into this report 
for risks associated with our proposed merger with pixelworks  inc  please see the section entitled risk factors of the registration statement on form s filed by pixelworks  inc with the securities and exchange commission on april   as amended 
a copy of those risk factors is attached to this report as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference 
factors that may affect future operating results the following factors may have a harmful impact on our business our success will depend on the growth of the flat panel computer monitor market and other electronics markets our ability to generate increased revenues will depend on the growth of the flat panel computer monitor market 
our continued growth will also depend upon emerging markets for consumer electronics markets such as home theater  flat panel and digital television  and hdtv 
the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development are uncertain and will depend in particular upon a significant reduction in the costs of products in the respective markets  the availability  at a reasonable price  of components required by such products  such as lcd panels  and the emergence of competing technologies 
for the year ended march   of our revenues were derived from sales to customers in the flat panel computer monitor market 
this and other potential markets may not develop as expected  which would harm our business 
a large percentage of our revenues come from sales to a small number of customers the markets for our products are highly concentrated 
our sales are derived from a limited number of customers 
sales to our largest five customers accounted for of our revenues  and for our largest customer  for the year ended march  we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements so that any customer could cease purchasing products at any time without penalty 
the decision by any large customer to decrease or cease using our products could harm our business 
the sales of our products are highly concentrated and our products may not continue to be accepted in the flat panel computer monitor market and other emerging markets our sales are derived from a limited number of products 
sales of our top five products accounted for of our revenues for the year ended march  we expect that a small number of products will continue to account for a large amount of our revenues 
our success in the flat panel computer monitor market  as well as the markets for home theater  dvd  flat panel and digital television  and hdtv will depend upon the extent to which manufacturers of those products incorporate our integrated circuits into their products 
our ability to sell products into these markets will depend upon demand for the functionality provided by our products and their pricing 
we typically need to determine the functionality of our products and to complete their design in advance of our customers completing the designs of their products 
as a result  we may not be able to react to changes in our customers desired functionality in a timely manner 
the failure of our products to be accepted in the flat panel computer monitor market in particular would harm our business 
we must develop new products and enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change we must develop new products and enhance our existing products with improved technologies to meet rapidly evolving customer requirements and industry standards 
we need to design products for customers that continually require higher functionality at lower costs 
this requires us to continue to add features to our products and to include all of these features on a single chip 
the development process for these advancements is lengthy and will require us to accurately anticipate technological innovations and market trends 
developing and enhancing these products is time consuming  costly and complex 
there is a risk that these developments and enhancements will be late  fail to meet customer or market specifications  and will not be competitive with other products using alternative technologies that offer comparable functionality 
we may be unable to successfully develop new products or product enhancements 
any new products or product enhancements may not be accepted in new or existing markets 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products or product enhancements  that failure will harm our business 
we face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and are characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapidly declining average selling prices 
we compete with both large companies and start up companies  including micronas ag  macronix international co  ltd  media reality technologies  inc  mstar semiconductor  inc  philips semiconductors  a division of philips electronics nv  pixelworks  inc  realtek semiconductor corp  silicon image  inc  smartasic inc  st microelectronics  inc  topro technology inc  trident microsystems  inc 
and trumpion microelectronics  inc 
we anticipate that as the markets for our products develop  our current customers may develop their own products and competition from diversified electronic and semiconductor companies will intensify 
some competitors are likely to include companies with greater financial and other resources than us 
increased competition could harm our business  by  for example  increasing pressure on our profit margins or causing us to lose customers 
our future operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business our future operating results will depend in large part on how well we manage our business  including our ability to develop profitable products and meet milestones by accurately forecasting revenues and costs and allocating resources effectively  develop strategies to protect our brands and to realize their potential value  manage our inventory levels by accurately predicting sales volumes  maximize our gross margins by negotiating favorable yet competitive prices with customers  and by leveraging volume to reduce costs with our suppliers  develop effective selling tools  and monitor and manage expenses 
any failure by us to effectively manage our business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies we have been issued patents and have pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in particular  we have brought patent infringement suits against third parties 
an unfavorable outcome in these suits could result in invalidation of the patents we assert in these suits 
intellectual property infringement suits brought against us may significantly harm our business we are currently defending claims brought against us by silicon image  inc  which allege that certain of our products that contain digital receivers infringe various silicon image patent claims 
the case is pending before the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia 
silicon image  inc is seeking an injunction to halt the sale  manufacture and use of our dvi receiver products and unspecified monetary damages 
trial was set for january  but the trial was taken off the calendar of the court in december and has not been rescheduled 
since january  the parties have filed case dispositive motions  which were heard by the court in march we are currently awaiting the court s ruling on these motions  which ruling could result in dismissal of the case against us on terms that may be favorable or unfavorable to us  setting the case for trial and or entry by the court of other orders which we cannot predict 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to silicon image s claims 
however  this or any future lawsuits could subject us to a permanent injunction preventing us from selling selected products or incurring significant monetary damages 
based on our revenue for the year ended march   approximately of our revenues could be impacted by this patent litigation 
we may become subject to additional intellectual property litigation in the future 
in addition  intellectual property lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  incur substantial settlement costs  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell some of our products  which could harm our business 
we may lose our customers or be required to make payments to them in connection with patent infringement litigation our customers typically buy our components and integrate them into their products for resale 
as a result of patent infringement litigation  our customers may decide to stop buying from us to ensure that their products do not include infringing components  even if the patent litigation is ultimately decided in our favor 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and market share 
in addition  from time to time  we enter into agreements with our customers that may contain indemnification provisions in connection with sales of our components that are the subject of patent litigation 
if one of our customers incurs a loss because of a patent infringement suit brought against them or us  we may be required  under those agreements or otherwise  to reimburse those customers for their loss 
any such indemnification obligations could result in significant payments by us that would have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we may become subject to judgments for securities class action suits we are a defendant in a securities class action suit 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in the securities class action suit as well as adequate insurance coverage to cover any likely unfavorable outcome 
however  this or any future securities class action suit could subject us to judgments in excess of our insurance coverage and could harm our business 
in addition  this kind of lawsuit  regardless of its outcome  is likely to be time consuming and expensive to resolve and may divert management time and resources 
the processes used to manufacture our semiconductor products are periodically retired as semiconductor manufacturing technologies advance  manufacturers typically retire their older manufacturing processes in favor of newer processes 
when this occurs  the manufacturer generally provides notice to its customers of its intent to discontinue a process  and its customers will either retire the affected part or design a newer version of the part that can be manufactured on the more advanced process 
consequently  our products may become unavailable from their current manufacturers if the processes on which they are produced are discontinued 
our devices are mainly and micron technology and these geometries will likely be available for the next two to three years 
we must manage the transition to new parts from existing parts 
we have commitments from our suppliers to provide notice of any discontinuance of their manufacturing processes in order to assist us in managing these types of product transitions 
our semiconductor products are complex and are difficult to manufacture cost effectively the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process 
it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying yield problems can only occur well into the production cycle  when a product exists which can be physically analyzed and tested 
defects in our products could increase our costs and delay our product shipments although we test our products  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these could harm our business 
we subcontract our manufacturing  assembly and test operations we do not have our own fabrication facilities  assembly or testing operations 
instead  we rely on others to fabricate  assemble and test all of our products 
most of our products use silicon wafers manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  with whom we have a fixed term sole source arrangement  the loss of which could result in a material increase in the price we must pay for silicon wafers 
none of our products are fabricated by more than one supplier 
there are many risks associated with our dependence upon outside manufacturing  including reduced control over manufacturing and delivery schedules of products  potential political or environmental risks in the countries where the manufacturing facilities are located  reduced control over quality assurance  difficulty of management of manufacturing costs and quantities  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  and potential misappropriation of intellectual property 
we depend upon outside manufacturers to fabricate silicon wafers on which our integrated circuits are imprinted 
these wafers must be of acceptable quality and in sufficient quantity and the manufacturers must deliver them to assembly and testing subcontractors on time for packaging into final products 
we have at times experienced delivery delays and long manufacturing lead times 
these manufacturers fabricate  test and assemble products for other companies 
we cannot be sure that our manufacturers will devote adequate resources to the production of our products or deliver sufficient quantities of finished products to us on time or at an acceptable cost 
the lead time necessary to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner is considerable 
we would be unable to readily obtain an alternative source of supply for any of our products if this proves necessary 
any occurrence of these manufacturing difficulties could harm our business 
our third party wafer foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors and significant customers are located in an area susceptible to earthquakes most of our outside foundries  third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in taiwan  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in addition  some of our significant customers are located in taiwan 
damage caused by earthquakes in taiwan may result in shortages of water or electricity or cause transportation difficulties that could limit the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of our subcontractors to provide assembly and test services 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to provide assembly and test services could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would harm our business 
foundries located in taiwan were responsible for most of our semiconductor product revenue for the year ended march  customers located in taiwan were responsible for of our revenue for the year ended march  if future earthquakes damage our customers facilities or equipment they could reduce their purchases of our products  which would harm our business 
in addition  the operations of suppliers to our outside foundries and our taiwanese customers could be disrupted by future earthquakes  which could in turn harm our business by resulting in shortages in our product supply or reduced purchases of our products 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers  and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders 
we manufacture our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may not be able to sell 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable  we would forego revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can then exceed six months 
it can take an additional six months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems that incorporate our products 
however  even when a manufacturer decides to design our products into its systems  the manufacturer may never ship systems incorporating our products 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we experience a delay between the time we increase expenditures for research and development  sales and marketing efforts and inventory and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
as a result  our business could be harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays its orders or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
our business depends on relationships with industry leaders that are non binding we work closely with industry leaders in the markets we serve to design products with improved performance  cost and functionality 
we typically commit significant research and development resources to such design activities 
we often divert financial and personnel resources from other development projects without entering into agreements obligating these industry leaders to continue the collaborative design project or to purchase the resulting products 
the failure of an industry leader to complete development of a collaborative design project or to purchase the products resulting from such projects would have an immediate and serious impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to establish such relationships in the future would  similarly  harm our business 
a large percentage of our revenues will come from sales outside of the united states  which creates additional business risks a large portion of our revenues will come from sales to customers outside of the united states  particularly to equipment manufacturers located in south korea  china  japan and taiwan 
for the year ended march   sales to regions outside of the united states represented of revenues 
for that same period  sales to south korea alone constituted of revenues 
these sales are subject to numerous risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and economic instability  exposure to litigation in these countries  longer payment periods  ability to enforce contracts or payment terms  potentially adverse tax consequences  export license requirements  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
because our sales are denominated in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products denominated in local currencies 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations  which may harm our business we depend on product design groups located outside of the united states  primarily in canada and in india 
we also rely on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly and testing operations 
these foreign operations subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including acts of terrorism  which may delay the shipment of our products  impair our ability to travel or our ability to communicate with foreign locations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be designed  manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this increases the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may lead to significant variances in the demand for our products in the past  significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand have characterized the semiconductor industry 
also  the industry has experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions  including economic conditions in asia 
these cycles have led to significant variances in product demand and production capacity 
they have also accelerated the erosion of average selling prices per unit 
we may experience periodic fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
we have grown rapidly  which strains our management and resources we are experiencing a period of significant growth that will continue to place a great strain on our management and other resources 
to manage our growth effectively  we must implement and improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  including our sales force  and attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners  and other third parties  such as our foundry and test partners 
moreover  we will spend substantial amounts of time and money in connection with our rapid growth and may have unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on expanding sales and marketing  research and development and administrative support 
if we cannot attract qualified people or manage growth effectively  our business would be seriously harmed 
we may not be able to attract or retain the key personnel we need to succeed competition for qualified management  engineering and technical employees is intense 
as a result  employees could leave with little or no prior notice 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain employees 
in particular  we may need to expand the depth of our management team in the future by hiring additional management personnel  who may have specific experience in our company s field 
we recently expanded the role of our senior vice president of marketing so that he now serves also as our chief operating officer 
if we cannot attract and retain key employees  our business would be harmed  particularly if the departure of any key employee results in a business interruption or if we are not successful in preserving any material knowledge of our departing employees 
a breakdown in our information technology systems could cause a business interruption  impair our ability to manage our business or report results  or result in the unauthorized disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information our information technology systems could suffer a sudden breakdown as a result of factors beyond our control  such as earthquakes  insecure connections or problems with our outside consultants who provide information technology services to us 
if our information technology systems were to fail and we were not able to gain timely access to adequate alternative systems or back up information  this could have a negative impact on our ability to operate and manage our business and to report results in a timely manner 
also  any breach of our information systems by an unauthorized third party could result in our confidential information being made public or being used by a competitor  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the potential of our proprietary rights 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the recent economic slowdown in the united states and in europe  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
as a result  if economic conditions in the united states and europe worsen or if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  reduced orders and shipments may cause us to fall short of our revenue expectations for any given period and may result in us carrying increased inventory 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
if our inventory builds up as a result of order postponement  we would carry excess inventory that is either unusable or that must be sold at reduced prices which will harm our revenues 
in addition  weakness in the technology market could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which could harm our financial condition 
in addition  political conditions  terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to our business  employees  supplies  distributors and resellers  and customers which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we may make acquisitions where advisable  and acquisitions involve numerous risks our growth is dependent upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we may address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies or technologies  such as our acquisitions of sage and the assets of vm labs 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following we may experience difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  we may be unable to retain the key employees of the acquired operations  the acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business  we may not be able to incorporate successfully the acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  and we may lack the experience to enter into new markets  products or technologies 
acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our recent or potential future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may lose key customers  foundries  licensors  sales representatives  other business partners  key management and other employees because of uncertainties surrounding our proposed merger with pixelworks in response to uncertainty concerning our proposed merger with pixelworks  our customers and suppliers may delay or defer purchasing decisions  elect to switch suppliers or choose to terminate supply arrangements 
foundries  licensors  sales representatives and others doing business with us may also experience uncertainty about their future role with us and may elect not to continue business with us  or may seek to modify the terms under which they do business in ways that are less attractive  more costly  or otherwise damaging to our business 
any one of those events could harm our business 
in addition  current employees  including key members of management  as well as prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future role with us as a result of the merger  which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  marketing and technical personnel 
the loss of or lack of continued efforts by key personnel could impair our product development and customer relationships  which could cause a decline in our sales  and could otherwise impair our business 
other factors to consider you should also consider the following factors the price of our stock fluctuates substantially and may continue to do so the stock market has experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  changes in market valuations of other technology companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions  charges and costs related to litigation and other extraordinary events  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  and the number of our shares that are available for trading by the public and the trading volume of our shares 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline and the value of your investment would be reduced 
in addition  the stock market experiences volatility often unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business  revenues  costs  expenses and financial condition terrorist acts or acts of war  wherever located around the world  may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers and customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the long term effects of the september  attacks on our business are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  hostilities in the middle east  including iraq  and other acts of war or hostility  especially in the korean peninsula  have created economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted 
in addition  as a company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
we carry out a significant portion of our operations outside the united states  primarily in canada and in india and to a lesser extent china  japan  south korea and taiwan 
although virtually all of our revenues and costs of revenues are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and those currencies 
any future strengthening of the those currencies against the us dollar could negatively impact our operating results by increasing our operating expenses as measured in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage the risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  other than natural hedges that occur as a result of holding both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
we may in the future undertake hedging or other such transactions if we determine that it is necessary to offset exchange rate risks 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at march   a near term appreciation or depreciation would not have a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
