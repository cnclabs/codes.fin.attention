overview the company is a designer  developer and manufacturer of electronics  communications and technology products for the defense and intelligence markets 
specifically  the company specializes in integrated passive surveillance  communications and data links  electronic countermeasures and threat simulators  and airborne imaging and scanning systems 
its products are developed for use primarily by us federal government customers and us approved foreign governments  including us defense and intelligence agencies  foreign governments agencies  and civilian agencies 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is derived from contracts with the us federal government 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  approximately and  respectively  of its revenues were derived from contracts with the us federal government 
for these same periods  approximately and  respectively  of its revenues were generated from contracts for which the company was the prime contractor  and approximately and  respectively  of its revenues were generated from sole or single source contracts 
single source contracts are contracts under which the purchaser purchases products only from the company  although other suppliers exist  while sole source contracts are contracts under which the purchaser purchases products from the company that only it can supply 
the percentage reduction in sole or single source contracts is the result of classifying all revenues of st production systems  inc  as derived from competitive contracts 
all of these contracts were acquired in february as part of the assets acquired from fel corporation 
in addition during these time periods  approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenues were generated from contracts relating to classified programs of the us federal government and select international contracts 
to estimate revenues for performance under us federal government fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts  including customer funded research and development  the company uses the percentage of completion method of accounting under which estimated revenues are determined on the basis of completion to date ie  the total contract amount multiplied by percent of performance to date less revenue value recognized in previous periods 
the company records revenues under cost reimbursement contracts as costs are incurred and it includes estimated earned fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
the company increases or decreases fees under certain us federal government contracts in accordance with cost or performance incentive provisions which measure actual performance against established targets or other criteria 
the company includes such incentive fee awards or penalties  which historically are not material  in revenues at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined 
the company recognizes anticipated probable losses at the time they become known 
the company s future operating results may be affected if actual contract costs incurred differ from its current estimates of total contract costs 
the company s revenues are primarily derived from fixed price contracts  under which it performs specific tasks for a fixed price 
under fixed price contracts the company assumes the risk of cost overruns  assuming no change orders can be negotiated  and receives the benefit of cost savings 
all of the company s us federal government contracts  whether it is the prime contractor or a subcontractor  are subject to audit and cost controls 
as a result  the us federal government contracting authorities typically have the right to object to the company s costs as not allowable or as unreasonable  which can result in it bearing all or a portion of these costs itself rather than recovering them from the us federal government 
the defense contract audit agency has completed its audit of our contracts through the fiscal year ended september  we are still subject to adjustment on our performance during subsequent years 
the company expenses operating costs such as cost of revenues  general and administrative  independent research and development expenses  and bid and proposal costs in the period incurred 
the major components of these costs are compensation  materials  and overhead 
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
the company s results of operations  particularly its revenues  gross profit and cash flow  may vary significantly from period to period depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contract performance  revenues earned on contracts  the timing of customer orders and billing of other direct costs  timing of receipt of significant change orders  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the timing of government contract awards  the term of each contract that it has been awarded  foreign budget reallocations  currency fluctuations  and general political and economic conditions 
because a significant portion of the company s expenses  such as personnel and facilities costs  are fixed in the short term  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity  as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any period may cause significant variations in operating results 
as a result of the factors above  period to period comparisons of its revenues and operating results may not be meaningful

liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and its line of credit 
the company s liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors  including the timing of production under its federal government and foreign sales contracts 
on november   the company sold million shares of common stock for net proceeds  after costs and underwriters commissions  of  on december   the underwriters exercised their overallotment option  which provided net proceeds to the company of  from the sale of an additional  shares

market risks in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks

cash and cash equivalents all unrestricted  highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions in excess of the amount insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
it believes that any credit risk related to these cash and cash equivalents is minimal 
interest rates the company s line of credit financing provides available borrowing to it at variable interest rates 
there were no outstanding borrowings at september  accordingly  the company does not believe that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
however  if the company were to significantly increase borrowing under the current line of credit agreement  future interest rate changes could potentially have a material impact 
foreign currency the company has contracts to provide services to us approved foreign countries 
its foreign sales contracts require payment in us dollars  so it is not affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual cash obligations due in due in due in due in due in total thereafter operating leases line of credit other commercial commitments total less than year years letters of credit cost associated with exit activity on july   the company announced its intention to close the facility in farmingdale  new jersey and move these operations to uniontown  pennsylvania 
in september  the company signed a lease for a  square foot facility for its uniontown  pennsylvania operations 
the term of the lease is for ten years with two five year options 
the company anticipates this move to be completed by february employees not transferring from the new jersey location will receive severance pay and or retention bonuses  providing they leave the company in accordance with the company s transition plan 
the cost associated with the severance and retention plan is estimated to be approximately  the severance cost expensed and accrued for the year ended september  is  other exit costs associated with the transition are estimated to be  other costs consist of principally training  relocation and moving costs 
other exit costs in the amount of  were expensed for the year ended september  the cost of the severance and retention plan and the other exit costs are reported in the cost of revenues and general and administrative expense line items of the consolidated statement of income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect its financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition most of the company s sales are generated under us federal government fixed price and cost type contracts  which require revenue recognition judgments 
revenues are primarily recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
in doing so  the company makes important judgments in estimating revenue  cost and progress towards completion 
the company has an internal process where it monitors contract performance and cost on a monthly basis 
each quarter  management reviews  among other items  progress against schedule  project staffing  risks and issues  subcontract management  incurred and estimated costs  and disposition of prior action items 
these judgments underlie the company s determinations regarding overall contract value  contract profitability  and timing of revenue recognition 
revenue and cost estimates are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  the company records the effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
if the estimated cost to complete exceeds the value of the contract  a reserve for estimated loss is recognized immediately 
it is reasonably possible that future operating results may be affected if actual contract costs incurred differ from total contract costs currently estimated by management 
revenue under time and material contracts is based on hours incurred multiplied by approved loaded labor rates plus other costs incurred plus general and administrative expenses allocated to other costs incurred 
the company has no reason to believe that costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are not fully realizable 
the company is currently recording the an slq a surface ship torpedo defense system contract at zero gross margin 
revenue from this contract amounted to in and in of the company s revenues 
this contract was acquired as part of the acquisition of certain assets of fel corporation and was performing at a potential loss at the date of acquisition 
the company has favorably performed under the contract since the date of acquisition and management has worked with the customer to reduce any potential loss through change orders approved to date 
while management currently estimates that the contract will be profitable  the profitability is dependent upon change orders  expected by management  but that have not yet been finalized 
change orders are under continuous negotiation with the customer 
when these change orders are received  the company will reassess the contract based on current estimates  and such reassessments are currently expected to result in increases to the margins recorded on the contract 
such increases would impact operations in the period such change orders are finalized as well as future periods 
if such change orders are not finalized under currently expected terms  or if the company does not perform as expected under the contract  contract losses may be required to be accrued 
management expects the change orders to be received in and the first half of accounts receivable the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of receivables  and the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to the company 
since most of the company s sales are generated under us federal government contracts  its allowance for doubtful accounts is not significant 
inventories the company records its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with the current or committed inventory levels 
inventory is generally purchased to fulfill a specific contract commitment 
during the year ended september   the company wrote down inventory by  the inventory was purchased  built and configured for a specific project  and such project has been delayed and has not yet been awarded 
as a result  the company wrote down the inventory based on expected uses in the next twelve months 
the company has allocated and will continue to allocate this inventory to other business objectives when given the opportunity 
income taxes the company currently has deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward is limited by internal revenue service guidelines to an annual maximum amount 
at september  and  the company did not provide a valuation allowance as it believed it was more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized  principally based on forecasted taxable income
