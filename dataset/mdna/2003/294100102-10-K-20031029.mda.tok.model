item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see forward looking and cautionary statements 
because of the foregoing factors  you should not rely on past financial results as an indication of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results to date are not necessarily meaningful and expect that our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period in the future 
enzo biochem  inc the company or enzo is a leading life sciences and biotechnology company focused on harnessing genetic processes to develop research tools  diagnostics and therapeutics 
enzo also provides clinical laboratory services to the medical community 
in addition  our work in gene analysis has led to our development of significant therapeutic product candidates  several of which are currently in clinical trials  and several are in preclinical studies 
the business activities of the company are performed by the company s three wholly owned subsidiaries 
these activities are research and development  manufacturing and marketing of biomedical research products and tools through enzo life sciences and research and development of therapeutic products through enzo therapeutics  and the operation of a clinical reference laboratory through enzo clinical labs 
for information relating to the company s business segments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s source of revenue has been from the direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets  as well as through non exclusive distribution agreements with other companies 
another source of revenue has been from the clinical laboratory service market 
clinical laboratory services are provided to patients covered by various third party insurance programs  including medicare and self payors for the services provided 
the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results 
volume of testing generally declines during the summer months  the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively  approximately and of the company s operating revenues were derived from research product sales and approximately and were derived from clinical laboratory services 
research product revenue from one major distributor represented approximately and of the consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively  under a non exclusive distribution and supply agreement 
research product revenue from this one major distributor accounted for approximately and of the company s total research product revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
at july  and  and respectively of the company s net accounts receivable relate to amounts due from the one major distributor 
on october   the company s life sciences subsidiary filed a lawsuit against this distributor 
see item legal proceedings 
the company anticipates that revenues for its enzo life sciences  inc subsidiary in the first quarter of fiscal will be comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at july   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million from july  we had working capital of million at july  compared to million at july  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended july  was approximately million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended july  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower net income in the current year offset by the net change in operating assets and liabilities compared to the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities increased approximately million from fiscal  primarily as a result of an investment in marketable securities and an increase in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by 
million from fiscal primarily as a result of the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net accounts receivable of million and million represented days and days of operating revenues at july  and  respectively 
the change in net accounts receivable is due to an increase in accounts receivable at the clinical reference laboratory of approximately 
million and a decrease of research products accounts receivable of approximately million 
this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in revenue from one specific customer of research products 
the company has entered into various real estate operating leases with both related and unrelated parties 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of these various leases 
the company has an exclusive licensing agreement to an invention covered by licensed patents 
under this agreement  the company is required to make certain minimum royalty payments of  per year through the life of the patents 
see note to the consolidated financial statement 
the total future payments under the company s contractual obligations as of july  are as follows payments due by period less than total year years years operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     we believe that our current cash position is sufficient for our foreseeable liquidity and capital resource needs  although there can be no assurance that future events will not alter such view 
management is not aware of any material claims  disputes or settled matters concerning third party reimbursements that would have a material effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon enzo biochem  inc consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  these estimates and judgments also affect related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contractual allowance  allowance for uncollectible accounts  intangible assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues from the clinical laboratory are recognized as services are rendered upon completion of the testing process for a specific patient 
the company s revenue is based on amounts billed or billable for services rendered  net of contractual adjustments and other arrangements made with third party payors to provide services at less than established billing rates 
revenues from research product sales  exclusive of certain non exclusive distribution agreements  are recognized when the products are shipped 
the company has certain non exclusive distribution agreements  which provide for consideration to be paid to the distributors for the manufacture of certain products 
the company records such consideration provided to distributors under these non exclusive distribution agreements as a reduction to research product revenues 
the revenue from these non exclusive distribution agreements are recognized when shipments are made to their respective customers and reported to the company 
contractual allowances the percentage of the company s revenues derived from medicare  third party payers  commercial insurers and managed care patients continue to increase 
the medicare regulations and various managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our clinical laboratory 
we estimate the allowance for contractual allowances on a payer specific basis given our interpretation of the applicable regulations and historical calculations 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by management 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables from third party payers is critical to its operating performance and cash flows 
the primary collection risk lies with uninsured patients or patients for whom primary insurance has paid but a patient portion remains outstanding 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since invoice date 
the company continually monitors its accounts receivable balances and utilizes cash collections data to support the basis for its estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payer mix or regulations could have a significant impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the company has implemented a process to estimate and review the collectibles of its receivables based on the period they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts 
the company also assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on the reserve estimates  which involves judgment 
the company believes that the collectibility of its receivables is directly linked to the quality of its billing processes  most notably  those related to obtaining the correct information in order to bill effectively for the services provided 
revisions in reserve for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense 
the company believes that its collection and reserves processes  along with the close monitoring of its billing processes  helps reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing operations 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the liability method requires that any tax benefits recognized for net operating loss carry forwards and other items be reduced by a valuation allowance where it is more likely than not the benefits may not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under the liability method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the requirement to recognize impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
company management believes that no impairment to its long lived assets has occurred 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  were million a decrease of million over revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  this decrease was due to a decrease of million in revenues from our research product sales operations offset by an increase of million in revenues from clinical reference laboratory operation over revenues for such activities in fiscal the decrease in research product sales resulted primarily from a decrease in direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets related to shipments to one major distributor 
research product revenue from this one major distributor accounted for approximately and of the company s total research product revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase of clinical laboratory services revenue was due primarily to increase volume of higher priced esoteric tests 
clinical laboratory services are provided to patients covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and health maintenance organizations hmo s 
billings for services are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances paid for differences between the amounts billed and the estimated amount to be paid 
recent trends had indicated a decrease in the collection rates from the medicare program  certain third party payors and hmo s 
the effect of such reduced collection rates have been reflected in fiscal the clinical laboratory is subject to seasonal fluctuations in operating results 
volume of testing generally declines during the summer months  the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year 
although  research product revenue decreased for the fiscal year  the cost of research products sold increased by million to million from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in reagent costs  the expansion of the manufacturing  processing capabilities and an increase in headcount in these areas  due to the unusually high volume of the orders shipped in the first quarter of fiscal to one major distributor that did not continue for the balance of fiscal the cost of clinical laboratory services decreased by 
million during this period primarily due to a reduction in personnel costs and the improved efficiency of performing certain esoteric tests in house that reduced certain other expenses 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million as a result of an increase in the expenses related to the clinical trial activities and other research projects 
selling expenses increased by 
million during this fiscal year  as compared to the prior year s fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to costs associated with the unusually high volume of the orders shipped in the first quarter of fiscal to one major distributor of research products 
general and administrative expenses increased by million due to the increase in overall insurance costs of professional  directors officers  liability insurance premiums and an increase in data processing personnel costs 
the company s legal expenses increased by million to million from million as compared to the previous year 
this increase is primarily due to the increase in patent infringement proceedings and the increase in the overall legal activities on these infringement proceedings 
the company s provision for uncollectible accounts receivable decreased by million to million from million as compared to last year at the clinical laboratory division 
the percentage of the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a relationship to revenue decreased to this fiscal year as compared to for last year 
these decreases were primarily due to the change in the mix of payors and improved collection procedures and the effect of the canceled hmo contract last year 
in addition  during the current fiscal year  the company wrote off 
million as an uncollectible receivable from one of its distributors at the life science division 
interest income was comparable to the prior fiscal year

income before provision for taxes on income from the research and development segment activities and related costs was million in fiscal  as compared to income before provision for taxes on income of million in fiscal the decrease in the profit resulted primarily from a decrease in direct sales of research products of labeling and detection reagents for the genomics and sequencing markets to one specific customer 
income before provision for taxes on income from the clinical reference laboratories segment amounted to a million for fiscal  as compared to a loss of million for fiscal the increase in income before taxes for the clinical laboratory segment was primarily due to the increase in revenue from an increase in higher gross margin reimbursement and an increase in volume of esoteric tests being ordered by physicians 
these esoteric tests have higher pricing levels as compared to the regular tests performed at the laboratory 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  were million an increase of million over revenues from operations for the fiscal year ended july  this increase was due to an increase of million in revenues from our research product sales operations offset by a decrease of million in revenues from clinical reference laboratory operation over revenues for such activities in fiscal the decline of clinical laboratory services revenue was due primarily to reduced reimbursement rates which have been experienced from various managed care agreements and the negative results of an unprofitable contract which was cancelled in fiscal clinical laboratory services are provided to patients covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and health maintenance organizations hmo s 
billings for services are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances paid for differences between the amounts billed and the estimated amount to be paid

the company has certain non exclusive distribution agreements  which provide for consideration to be paid to the distributors for the manufacture of certain products 
such consideration was previously included in cost of research product revenues 
in accordance with recently issued accounting pronouncements  the company has reclassified consideration provided to distributors under these non exclusive distribution agreements as a reduction to research product revenues 
the prior year s comparative amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation 
this change reflects a new reporting presentation only and did not affect the company s gross profit or net income as previously reported
