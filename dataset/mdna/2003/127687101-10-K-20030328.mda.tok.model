casino consolidated casino revenues increased million to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the year ended december  the mid south region contributed million of this increase primarily due to increased revenues at caesars indiana 
the revenue increase at caesars indiana is due to increased volume in tables and slots related to the initiation of dockside gaming on august   and the benefit of the room luxury hotel which opened in august the eastern region had a million increase in casino revenues over the prior year due to increased slot and table win at bally s atlantic city and caesars atlantic city 
the eastern region results were also favorably impacted by having a full year of operations of the claridge casino which we acquired in june those increases were offset by a million decrease in casino revenue in the western region 
this decline principally relates to reduced table and slot volumes at caesars palace  which continues to be negatively impacted by construction disruptions

rooms average daily rate occupancy percentage year ended december  year ended december  western region eastern region mid south region international region consolidated room revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly attributable to the western region where room revenue decreased due to lower occupancy and average daily rate at the las vegas hilton and the disposition of the flamingo reno in the fourth quarter of those decreases in the western region were partially offset by the increased room revenue at paris las vegas and bally s las vegas

other consolidated other revenues include retail sales  entertainment sales  telephone  management fee income and other miscellaneous income at our casino hotels 
consolidated other revenues decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally due to decreased revenues at caesars palace  the disposition of the flamingo reno in the fourth quarter of  and reduced management fee income at the conrad punta del este resort and casino in uruguay 
those decreases were offset by an increase in entertainment revenues at paris las vegas and bally s las vegas 
consolidated other expenses include costs associated with selling  general  administrative  property operations  retail  entertainment  telephone and other miscellaneous costs at our casino hotels 
consolidated other expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  was mainly attributable to a full year of operations of the claridge casino  as well as increases in other expenses such as insurance and real estate taxes 
depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for comparable period of this decrease was primarily due to goodwill amortization of million for the year ended december   that we no longer recognize in accordance with sfas no 
depreciation for the year ended december  also decreased due to the asset write down of the las vegas hilton in the third quarter of impairment losses and other  net in september  we recognized a million charge related to the voluntary termination of an energy contract with enron corporation 
we expect that this charge will be more than offset by future energy cost savings

the losses do not exceed the deductibles under our various insurance policies

net cash provided by operating activities was million in and million in we had availability under our credit facilities of billion at december   subject to continuing compliance with existing covenant restrictions 
we expect to finance our operations and capital expenditures through cash flow from operations  existing cash balances  borrowings under our credit facilities  and new issuances of debt securities 
cash flows from operations would be negatively impacted if our casino operations were affected by a downturn in the economy  increase in revenue or wagering taxes  acts of terrorism  war or other factors 
if this were to occur  we would be required to adjust our capital spending plans as described below 
we have two principal credit facilities 
the first is a day revolving credit facility expiring in august with total availability to us of million 
no amounts were outstanding under the day facility at december  the second facility is a billion five year facility  which matures december  with a billion two year extension upon expiration or voluntary termination of the existing five year facility 
we had billion drawn on this facility at december  capital spending and acquisitions investing cash flow activities include maintenance capital expenditures  new construction  and improvement projects at existing facilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities included million related to capital expenditures for normal maintenance and expansion projects 
our capital expenditures include maintenance capital expenditures which are those long lived assets required to maintain our properties in good operating condition 
such capital items include new gaming equipment  room and restaurant refurbishments  computer hardware  furniture and office equipment  vehicles  and other similar items 
additionally  our capital expenditures include major expansion projects funded during the year  which were primarily the  seat performing arts colosseum at caesars palace and the gateway  a connector bridge linking the claridge casino and bally s atlantic city  which includes a new retail  dining and convention complex

at the end of  the backlog of capital expenditure projects that we were then considering was million 
of this amount  approximately million associated with the saint regis mohawk casino project in sullivan county  new york will not be spent unless the new york state court of appeals rules favorably in the pending case challenging the constitutionality of new york state s casino statute 
of the million total  million is designated as maintenance capital and million is new unit capital including the million set aside for the mohawk casino project 
nearly million of the maintenance capital backlog is slot related  including the continued roll out of ez pay cashless slot technology 
nearly million is related to room and public space refurbishments 
properties with significant new unit capital backlog include caesars palace million  caesars atlantic city million and flamingo las vegas million 
we cannot predict with certainty how much of the million in backlog we will ultimately authorize for activation and expenditure 
as indicated above  total capital spending over the last three years has ranged from million to million 
investing cash flow activities for include the gain on sale of our percent equity interest in jupiters limited 
investing cash flow activities for include the acquisition of the claridge casino in june this property is adjacent to bally s atlantic city and provides additional hotel rooms and parking for our boardwalk complex guests 
other projects in february  we announced that we were considering the addition of an additional room tower and conference space at caesars palace in las vegas and the addition of a room tower at caesars atlantic city 
preliminary cost estimates at that time were million for the caesars palace additions and million for the caesars atlantic city additions 
the amounts for these new projects are not included in the million backlog discussed above 
in february  management also announced that further planning and expenditures on the caesars atlantic city additions  including a planned  space parking facility  have been suspended in view of a proposed increase of the new jersey state gross gaming revenue tax and the proposal to permit nearly  video slot machines at the state s racetracks 
a final commitment to undertake either or both of these projects is subject to approval by the board of directors 
during the second quarter of  we announced a project to redevelop the ocean one mall in atlantic city and connect it to caesars atlantic city 
the gordon group will develop and finance the project which is expected to be completed in late at caesars palace  we announced the expansion of the forum shops to be developed and financed by the simon property group 
the expansion is scheduled to open by fall of which will add  square feet to the  square foot mall 
at the flamingo las vegas  we announced plans to that we are teaming up with jimmy buffet to open margaritaville caf and entertainment complex 
the multi level restaurant  bar and live music stage is scheduled to open in the fall of saint regis mohawk tribe we entered into an agreement in april with the saint regis mohawk tribe in hogansburg  new york 
we paid million for exclusive rights to develop a class ii or class iii casino project with the tribe in the state of new york 
in november  the parties also entered into a seven year definitive management agreement for park place to manage a casino to be located at kutsher s country club in monticello  new york in return for a management fee equal to percent of ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
the management agreement is subject to the approval of the national indian gaming commission 
we have entered into a definitive agreement  as amended  to acquire approximately acres of the kutsher s resort hotel and country club in sullivan county  new york  for approximately million  with an option to purchase the remaining  acres for million 
upon approval by the bureau of indian affairs bia  approximately acres will be transferred to be held in trust for the saint regis mohawk nation 
all of the agreements and plans relating to the development and management of this project are contingent upon various regulatory and governmental approvals  including execution of a compact between the saint regis mohawk tribe and the state of new york  and receipt of approvals from the bia  national indian gaming commission and local planning and zoning boards 
there is no guarantee that the requisite regulatory approvals will be received 
in october  the new york state legislature enacted a bill  which the governor signed  authorizing a total of six indian casinos in the state of new york three in western new york and three in the catskill region and approved the use of video lottery terminals at racetracks and authorized the participation of new york state in a multi state lottery 
the legislation also gives the governor the authority to negotiate state compacts with the tribes without further approval by the legislature 
the constitutionality of this legislation has been challenged 
for a discussion of such litigation  see mohawk litigation in item legal proceedings 
other from time to time we become aware of potential acquisition or development opportunities and we may at any time be negotiating to engage in transactions or developments both domestically and internationally 
additionally  we regularly evaluate all of our assets within our portfolio and have and will continue to consider disposition of assets that  in our opinion  do not represent the best use of our capital 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with cash on hand and availability under our various credit facilities  will be adequate to fund the capital expenditures that we are reasonably likely to make over the foreseeable future 
to the extent that our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or that our various credit instruments are not extended or renewed in adequate amounts  we may be required to reduce or suspend our capital investment activities 
borrowings at december   we had approximately billion in long term indebtedness outstanding 
of this amount  approximately billion is borrowed under nine separate bond issues maturing at various dates from august to may the remaining billion is drawn under our credit facilities 
we have two principal credit facilities  collectively known as the credit facilities 
the first is a day revolving credit facility expiring in august with total availability to us of million 
the second facility is a billion five year facility  which matures december  with a billion two year extension upon expiration or voluntary termination of the existing five year facility 
the credit facilities contain financial covenants including a maximum leverage ratio total debt to ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities of to and a minimum interest coverage ratio ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities  to interest expense of to as of december  we are required to compute our actual leverage and interest coverage ratios on a rolling twelve month basis as of the end of each calendar quarter 
if we are not in compliance with the required covenant ratios  an event of default would occur  which if not cured could cause the entire outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities to become immediately due and payable as well as trigger the cross default provisions of our other debt issues 
the maximum leverage ratio covenant adjusts to to for each of the quarterly testing periods ending march  and june   and to  thereafter 
the minimum interest coverage ratio will remain to for subsequent quarterly testing periods 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the applicable covenants 
borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate and may be obtained  at our option  as libor advances for varying periods  or as base rate advances  each adjusted for an applicable margin as further described in the credit facilities  or as competitive bid loans 
we have historically borrowed using libor advances and expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future 
we pay a margin over libor which is a function of both our leverage ratio and our credit rating  this margin is adjusted quarterly 
at december   our effective all in borrowing cost of libor advances under the five year credit facility was libor plus basis points 
the maximum all in borrowing cost for libor loans is under the day facility and the five year facility plus or minus pre determined discounts based on our leverage ratios 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities was at december  and at december  as of december   our senior unsecured debt was rated bal by moody s and bbb by standard poor s 
the margin above libor is based on the higher of these two ratings 
if our debt were downgraded one level by standard poor s to bb  the annual interest on our credit facilities would increase by approximately million per year based on outstanding borrowings of billion at december  we have established a commercial paper program 
to the extent that we incur debt under this program  we must maintain an equivalent amount of credit available under our credit facilities 
we have borrowed under the program for varying periods during at december  and  no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program 
in a program designed for short term borrowings at lower interest rates than what are paid under our credit facilities  we have entered into an uncommitted line of credit agreement with a lender whereby we can borrow up to million for periods of ninety days or less 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
borrowings bear interest at current market rates 
interest rates on amounts borrowed under these agreements during the year ranged from percent to percent 
in march  we issued million of senior subordinated notes due through a private placement offering to institutional investors 
these notes were subsequently exchanged for notes registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are redeemable at any time prior to their maturity at the make whole premiums described in the indenture governing such notes 
the notes are unsecured obligations  rank equal with our other senior subordinated indebtedness and are junior to all of our senior indebtedness 
proceeds from this offering were used to reduce borrowings under the credit facilities 
our indebtedness contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency and cross defaults to other material indebtedness 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
in january  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission registering up to billion in debt or equity securities 
the terms of any securities offered pursuant to the shelf registration will be determined by market conditions at the time of issuance 
in november  million of senior notes were issued and in september  million of senior subordinated notes were issued under this shelf registration statement 
availability under the shelf registration statement at december  was approximately million 
we have structured our long term debt to mature at various amounts and intervals throughout the next nine years 
we issue debt as needed to maintain a flexible capital structure  subject to the availability of appropriate rates and terms 
the actual maturities by year for our long term debt and contractual obligations for our long term leases as of december  are shown in the table below amounts in millions payments due by year thereafter total long term debt    operating leases total    share repurchases our board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to million shares under a common stock repurchase program 
cumulatively  through december   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock at an average price of resulting in million shares remaining available under the stock repurchase program 
the amount and timing of any additional purchases will depend on market conditions and our financial position 
we currently expect that excess free cash flow will be used primarily to reinvest in our properties and reduce debt outstanding 
competition there is intense competition in the gaming industry 
the construction of new properties or the enhancement or expansion of existing properties in any market in which we operate could have a negative impact on our business in that market 
a new  room hotel casino is currently under construction in atlantic city  new jersey with an announced completion date of summer this project represents a significant increase in capacity in that market 
other competitors in atlantic city have recently completed expansions of their hotels and others have announced expansion projects 
the state of new jersey is considering approving video lottery terminals vlts at the racetracks in the state and increasing certain taxes that may impact the gaming industry  including a proposed increase in the gross gaming tax from to 
if vlts are approved  it would adversely affect our operations and an increase in the gross gaming tax without a significant simultaneous increase in revenue would adversely affect our results of operations 
for a further discussion see other projects under the financial condition section 
several of our competitors in las vegas  nevada are currently expanding their operations with additional hotel towers  which  if completed  will add a significant number of new hotel rooms to the las vegas market 
in addition  another competitor is constructing a new  room hotel casino expected to be completed in april our businesses may be adversely impacted i by the additional gaming and room capacity generated by this increased competition in las vegas and atlantic city and or ii by other projects not yet announced in any of the other markets 
in addition  our operations in laughlin  nevada and northern nevada have been adversely impacted and will continue to be adversely impacted by native american gaming in california and arizona 
the business at our hotel casinos will also be adversely affected if gaming were to be newly legalized or expanded under the laws of any state or locale located near our existing properties 
particularly  the legalization of gaming operations in locations near las vegas  atlantic city or mississippi will negatively affect our properties located there 
we understand that several states surrounding our existing operations  including pennsylvania  maryland  delaware and kentucky  are considering the legalization of some form of casino and or slot gaming or the expansion of existing gaming activities 
the legalization of any form of casino gaming in these or other states could adversely affect our operating results 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
in october  the new york state legislature enacted a bill  which the governor signed  authorizing a total of six indian casinos in the state of new york three in western new york and three in the catskill region and approved the use of video lottery terminals at racetracks and authorized the participation of new york state in a multi state lottery 
this could adversely affect visitation of our atlantic city properties from new york 
in california  there has been a proliferation of casino style gaming on tribal lands  and there is consideration by the governor of california of an initiative to significantly increase the scope of such operations in exchange for tax revenue 
the presence of native american casinos in california has had a negative impact on the results of our nevada casinos  and an increase in the capacity of those casinos in california can be expected to further impact our nevada operations 
several states are considering or have announced plans to allow video lottery terminals or slot machines at racetracks in consideration of tax revenue from those operations 
to the extent that these operations are conducted in states which we have properties  or in neighboring states  we could be adversely affected 
uncertainties due to military conflict on march   the united states and coalition forces commenced a war with iraq 
due to travel advisories  the increased threat of terrorism both domestically and internationally  and concern of the war s affect on the domestic and international economies  the travel and tourism industries may be affected 
the outcome and duration of this war are uncertain and could have a negative impact on our future operating results 
baluma holdings  sa over the past several years  we have provided capital in the form of loans to baluma holdings  sa holdings  the ultimate parent of baluma  sa baluma  the entity that owns the conrad punta del este resort casino the resort  in punta del este  uruguay 
two promissory notes the baluma loans  aggregating million in principal  matured on july   the principal  together with certain accrued and unpaid interest  was not repaid 
the baluma loans are secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets comprising the resort and on the stock of baluma 
we and holdings are currently negotiating a restructuring of the baluma loans 
in the event that we are unable to negotiate a restructuring acceptable to all affected parties  we may consider exercising our rights as secured creditor 
we have not recorded any impairment losses against our investments in baluma and holdings 
only after a restructuring is completed will we be able to compare the value of our reorganized investments to their historical cost 
although we enjoy a very senior position as creditor  it is nevertheless possible that we will have to recognize an impairment loss upon reorganization 
we intend to continue to operate the resort pursuant to a management agreement 
as described elsewhere in this report  the resort is currently suffering the adverse effects of the economic turmoil in argentina  brazil and uruguay 
regulation and taxes the gaming industry is highly regulated and we must adhere to various regulations and maintain our licenses to continue our operations 
the ownership  management  and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive federal  state  provincial  tribal and or local laws  rules  and regulations  which are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction 
these laws  rules  and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but generally concern the responsibility  financial stability  and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations 
the regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the gaming industry provides a significant source of tax revenue for the states  counties  and municipalities in which we operate 
occasionally  proposals are made by federal and state legislators to amend tax laws affecting the gaming industry 
changes in such laws  if any  would have a material effect on our results of operations 
the general economic downturn has increased the need for state and local governments to fund budget deficits in many of the states where we have operations 
in partial response  several state legislatures  including nevada and new jersey  are currently considering proposals to increase existing taxes and or enact new taxes on businesses operating within the state  or in some cases by specifically targeting additional tax measures at hotel casinos 
these taxes may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  we have estimated that if a new tax measure proposed by the governor of new jersey on february  were adopted in its originally proposed form  our current new jersey tax burden of more than million would increase by approximately million a year  an increase of nearly percent 
we cannot predict whether this proposal or other tax proposals will be enacted  and if so  what final form such new legislation will take  nor can we predict whether other states will ultimately enact similar proposals 
significant accounting policies a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant among those estimates are the useful lives and potential impairment of long term assets  such as investments  buildings  equipment and goodwill  the adequacy of our allowance for uncollectible receivables  and the amount of litigation and self insurance reserves 
these estimated amounts are based on our best judgments using both historical information and known trends in our company and in our industry 
because of the uncertainty inherent in any estimate  it is likely that the actual results could differ from the initial estimates  and the differences could be material 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered to be the most significant 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
judgments are made in determining if or when assets have been impaired and the estimated useful lives of assets 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the depreciation expense recognized in our results of operations 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe represents the useful life of each category of asset 
we also maintain equity method investments in entities that own and operate casino hotel properties and entities that perform other activities related or incidental to the operation of casino hotels 
the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
management assesses the possibility of an asset impairment by using estimates of future cash flows which are affected by current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that requires an annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
we completed our implementation analysis and recorded an impairment charge in the first quarter of we also completed our annual review of impairment and determined that goodwill has not been further impaired 
the annual evaluation of goodwill requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we allow for an estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a specific formula applied to aged receivables as well as a specific review of large balances 
historical experience is considered  as are customer relationships  in determining specific reserves 
litigation reserves the company assesses its exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  we consider our historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such change may have on our variable rate debt 
we attempt to limit the impact of changes in interest rates by balancing the mix of our borrowings pursuant to our credit facilities and our long term fixed rate debt 
at december   we had no investments in financial derivatives  including interest rate swaps 
of our total outstanding long term debt of billion at december   billion is subject to variable interest rates  which averaged at december  our variable rate debt is affected by the general level of libor interest rates 
therefore  our interest rates on the credit facilities will change as libor changes 
based on our billion of outstanding debt under the credit facilities at december   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense change of approximately million 
the fair value of debt under the credit facilities approximates the carrying value 
the total fair value of long term debt at december  was billion and the carrying value was billion 
the fair values are based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities
