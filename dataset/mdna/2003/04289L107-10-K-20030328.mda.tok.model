item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item business risk factors that may affect results and elsewhere in this report 
we were founded in december from through  we devoted our efforts principally to building  marketing and selling our professional services capabilities and to research and development activities related to our software products 
beginning in  we began to focus on selling our software products 
to date  we have enhanced and released several versions of our products 
we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology alliances and original equipment manufacturers 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software product licenses and related services 
product license revenues are derived from the sale of software licenses of our products 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training and software maintenance and support 
professional services include implementation  custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in some cases  on a fixed price schedule defined specifically in our contracts 
software maintenance and support arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases as well as on line and telephone technical support for an annual maintenance fee  which is calculated as a certain percentage of the list price of the licensed product  or on a net purchase price for site licenses 
training is billed as services are provided 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element accounting treatment is allocated to each undelivered element using the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
typically our software licenses do not include significant post delivery obligations to be fulfilled by us and payments are due within a three month period from the date of delivery 
consequently  license fee revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped 
revenues from software maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements as earned for guaranteed minimum royalties  generally ratably over one year  or based upon unit sales by the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized on either a time and materials or percentage of completion basis as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
unbilled services represent service revenues that 
table of contents have been earned by us in advance of billings 
deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments related to support and maintenance and service agreements 
as of december  we had offices in australia  canada  england  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  sweden  and the united states 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in in december  we initiated a restructuring plan  which included the closing of our offices in australia  canada  and the netherlands at varying times during the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition not only is revenue recognition a key component of our results of operations  the timing of our revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of sop and sop sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists via a signed license agreement  physical or electronic delivery has occurred including the availability of license keys or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operational results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
accounts receivable and bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with fas  accounting for research and development costs fas  and fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed fas  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general 
table of contents product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring expenses during and  we recorded restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  pertaining to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets as discussed below  employee severance benefits  and settling of certain contractual obligations 
the charges were recorded in accordance with etif  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  fas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
in determining the charges to record  we made certain estimates and judgments surrounding the amounts ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
at december   there are various accruals recorded for the costs to exit certain facilities and lease obligations  which may be adjusted periodically for either resolution of certain contractual commitments or changes in estimates of sub lease income or the period of time the facilities will be vacant and sub leased 
although we do not anticipate significant changes to our restructuring accruals  the actual costs may differ from those recorded in the event that the subleasing assumptions require adjustment due to changes in economic conditions surrounding the real estate market or we are successful in terminating our lease obligations prior to the scheduled termination date 
such changes could have a material impact to our operating results 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we review our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed the fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
as a result of our restructuring activities in and  we evaluated the realizability of our long lived assets including fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our restructured facility leases and intangible assets consisting primarily of unamortized goodwill 
in  we determined that million of furniture and fixtures  computer equipment and software were impaired as a result of our decision to abandon the assets because of the termination of employees and related closures of offices in our and restructuring plans 
these assets are no longer being used or will not be used in the future upon completion of the restructuring plan  which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of in addition   of leasehold improvements were deemed to be impaired due to exiting certain office locations and the estimated sub lease income was not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value 
in  we determined that million of leasehold improvements and million of furniture  fixtures and equipment were impaired as a result of these restructured operating leases 
in addition we determined that approximately million of purchased software was impaired due to our revised product development strategy 
lastly we wrote off the remaining unamortized goodwill of million due to the closure and abandonment of two professional service acquisitions completed in fiscal year accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realizability 
in addition  we have provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although  we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made

as part of the settlement  we agreed to pay broadvision a total of million in license fees  which are being accounted for as cost of product license revenues 
for  approximately half of our cost of product license revenues related to the broadvision settlement that was fully paid as of december  accordingly we expect cost of product license revenues to decrease in as compared with cost of product license revenues increased to million in from million in this increase primarily related to increased compensation and benefit costs associated with sustaining engineering activities

due to cost reduction initiatives we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will trend slightly lower as a percentage of total revenues and in absolute dollars in stock based compensation from the fourth quarter of through  we had recognized total deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity of million in connection with stock option grants 
these amounts represent the difference between the exercise price of certain stock option grants and the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of our common stock at the time of these grants 
additionally  in july  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for unvested stock options acquired in connection with the acquisition of the toronto technology group  inc the number of these stock options has been reduced due to the recipients of these grants terminating their employment with us 
we are amortizing these amounts over the vesting periods of the applicable options

in determining the facilities related costs  atg has estimated the vacancy period and sublease income 
a component of the fourth quarter facility related cost was a change in estimate of the second quarter facility related restructuring charge 
the net change in estimate was an additional charge of million in the fourth quarter 
of the million charge  a credit of million was realized due to the buy out of a lease included in the second quarter charge of million  which is being paid ratably over years 
this credit was offset by an increase of approximately million due to updated assumptions  as a result of a market analysis indicating lower sublease rates and longer vacancy periods for two leases provided for in the second quarter 
included in the facility related costs was the write off of the abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets of million and million  respectively 
these fixed assets were directly related to the restructured excess office facilities 
the employee severance cost component of the restructuring charge was related to reductions in personnel 
as part of the restructuring atg terminated the employment of employees  or of atg s workforce 
approximately of these employees were from sales and marketing  from services  from general and administrative and from research and development 
in addition  atg settled  exchangeable shares with a certain employee 
upon settlement  atg recorded million as a charge to restructuring 
the asset impairment related costs included the write off of the remaining unamortized goodwill of approximately million  which was related to the two professional service acquisitions completed in in addition  the company determined that approximately million of purchased software was deemed impaired due to atg s revised product development strategy 
during the second quarter of  atg recorded a net charge increasing the restructured lease obligation accruals by  the company increased one lease obligation estimate by million as a result of adjusting the estimated sublease income and vacancy assumptions due to the continued weakening of the real estate market in that location 
offsetting this increase  atg recognized a benefit of  from two other restructured lease obligation accruals due to favorable sublease transactions consummated during the second quarter 
this net charge has been offset by the company receiving a refund of  relating to the marketing component of the restructuring charge recorded in fiscal  resulting in a net credit to income of  for the quarter ended june  also  during the fourth quarter of  atg recorded a charge of  to increase charges recorded in for lease obligations of idle locations

the facilities related charge associated with the fourth quarter action was  comprising  for operating leases related to office space that is either idle or will be vacated during the first quarter of and  of leasehold improvement and furniture and fixtures written down to their estimated fair value 
the company also recorded a charge of  for severance and benefit costs related to cost reduction actions taken across the worldwide employee base  and as a result of this action and the actions taken in  the company wrote off  of computer equipment and software  which were no longer being used due to the reduction in personnel and office locations 
the lease charge is for office space the company is vacating and intends to sub lease 
the amount of the operating lease charge is based on assumptions from current real estate market data for sub lease income rates and vacancy rates at each respective location 
the severance and benefit costs were for employees  or of the company s workforce  consisting of employees from sales and marketing  from services  from general and administrative and from research and development 
the company accrued employee benefits pursuant to ongoing benefits plans and statutory minimum requirements in foreign locations 
the company began the termination process on january  as a result of a reduction of employees on a worldwide basis in the and restructuring actions  as well as the closure of certain office locations  the company wrote off computer equipment and software and furniture and fixtures that it has abandoned and will not be used in the future 
these assets have been written down to their fair value based on the expected cash flows they will generate over their remaining economic life 
due to the short remaining economic life and current market conditions for such assets  the fair value of these assets has been estimated as zero 
in addition  the company wrote off leasehold improvements related to the facilities it is attempting to sub lease because the estimated cash flows to be generated from those locations are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the company expects to substantially complete the above actions by the end of the first quarter of once fully complete  we anticipate the restructuring activities will result in annual savings of approximately million to million 
as of december   the company had an accrued restructuring liability of million  of which million relates to restructuring charges and million relates to restructuring charges

due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of our net deferred tax assets  net operating losses and research credits carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance 
the provision in includes a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter to reverse income tax benefits recognized in the first three quarters of and to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the realizability of these assets 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the public and private sales of equity securities  commercial credit facilities and capital leases 
in  we also funded our cash requirements in part from operations 
at february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
cash used in operating activities was million in this consisted of operating losses of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  an increase in accrued restructuring of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
other changes in working capital items consisted primarily of million in cash used for accrued expenses and a decrease in deferred revenues

to support growth in headcount and global expansion  assets acquired in both and consisted principally of leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software 
we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately million over the next twelve months 
effective december   we modified our existing working capital facility with silicon valley bank the bank 
our eligible line of credit was increased to million from million 
the new line is no longer tied to of eligible accounts receivable 
while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   we have issued letters of credit lc s totaling million  which are supported by this facility 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
as of december   approximately million was available for future borrowings 
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible intellectual and personal property and is subject to financial covenants including liquidity coverage and profitability 
the liquidity covenant mandates atg maintain million in cash at the end of each month throughout the duration of the facility 
the profitability covenant allows for net losses not to exceed  million for the fourth quarter of  million for the first quarter of  million for the second quarter of  million for the third and fourth quarters of the bank has granted additional provisions  to be used if necessary  for a maximum million in restructuring charges for the duration of the facility 
of the million  a maximum of million may be taken as a cash expense during the term of the facility  a second provision is made for a maximum of million in cash to be paid toward real estate buy outs 
we are required to maintain million in unrestricted cash with the bank at all times  and in the event the balance should decrease  we will be required to pay fees and expenses to compensate the bank for lost income 
as of december   we were in compliance with all related financial covenants 
in the event that we do not comply with any of the covenants within the line of credit or default on any of our provisions  the bank s significant remedies include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  ceasing to advance money or extend credit for our benefit  applying to the obligations any balances and deposits held by us or any amount held by the bank owing to or for the credit or the account of us  and  putting a hold on any deposit account held as collateral 
if the agreement expires  or is not extended  the bank will require outstanding lc s at that time to be cash secured on terms acceptable to the bank 
the revolving line of credit expires on december  as of december   we had commitments totaling approximately million in the form of outstanding lc s in favor of our various landlords to secure obligations under our facility leases pursuant to leases expiring in through as of december   all of the lc s were secured under our line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  principally representing proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by payments on long term obligations to broadvision

net cash provided by financing activities was  in  principally representing proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by payments on long term obligations to broadvision 

table of contents we lease our facilities under operating leases that expire between and the aggregate minimum annual rental payment under these leases is million  which includes approximately million payable in of the million  million is included in the combined and restructuring charges 
the million was reduced to a million restructuring charge after taking into consideration estimated sublease income and estimated vacancy periods 
for additional information relating to our commercial and contractual commitments  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual cash obligations  which consist solely of operating leases  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years lease commitments we believe that our existing financial resources  together with cash generated by our operations  will be able to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas supercedes eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and establishes when a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity must be recognized  which is at the time the liability is incurred 
severance pay  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than up front 
if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period a liability should be recognized as employees render service over the future service period even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas

as of december   we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fas as disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value as opposed to the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new guaranty disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim or annual periods ending after december  we are not aware of any guarantees that require disclosure as of december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk  however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
to date  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our operating results 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  however  at december   there were no outstanding derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
