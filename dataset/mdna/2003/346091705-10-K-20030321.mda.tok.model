promark also faces competition from other gas marketers  some of whom are significantly larger in size and have greater financial resources than promark  canadian forest or forest 
regulation our oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations 
united states 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted and by certain agencies of the federal government for operations on federal leases 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas  including provisions requiring permits for the drilling of wells and maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the abandonment of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states can order the pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation services separate from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
commencing in february  the ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which imposed a number of reforms intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
most major aspects of order no 
were upheld in judicial review  though certain issues were remanded to ferc  have been considered on remand  and are pending rehearing at ferc 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect forest only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent the ferc s regulations will survive rehearing and further judicial review and  if so  whether the ferc s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets in which our natural gas is sold 
however  we do not believe that we will be affected materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which and in which we compete 
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf the ocs provide open access  non discriminatory service 
commencing in april  ferc issued order no 
and subsequent orders collectively  order no 
 which imposed certain reporting requirements applicable to gas service providers operating on the ocs concerning their prices and other terms and conditions of service 
the purpose of order no 
is to provide regulators and other interested parties with sufficient information to detect and to remedy discriminatory conduct by such service providers 
ferc has stated that these reporting rules apply to ocs gatherers and has clarified that they may also apply to other ocs service providers including platform operators performing dehydration  compression  processing and related services for third parties 
the us district court overturned the ferc s reporting rules as exceeding its authority under ocsla 
the ferc has recently appealed this decision 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent these regulations might be reinstated  and what effect  if any  they may have on our financial condition or operations 
the rules  if reinstated  may increase the frequency of claims of discriminatory service  may decrease competition among ocs service providers and may lessen the willingness of ocs gathering companies to provide service on a discounted basis 
certain operations that we conduct are on federal oil and gas leases  which are administered by the bureau of land management blm and the minerals management service mms 
these leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed blm and mms regulations and orders pursuant to the ocsla which are subject to change by the mms 
many onshore leases contain stipulations limiting activities that may be conducted on the lease 
the stipulations are unique to particular geographic areas and may limit the times during which activities on the lease may be conducted  the manner in which certain activities may be conducted or  in some cases  may ban any surface activity 
for offshore operations  lessees must obtain mms approval for exploration  development and production plans prior to the commencement of such operations 
in addition to permits required from other agencies such as the coast guard and the environmental protection agency  lessees must obtain a permit from the blm or the mms  as applicable  prior to the commencement of drilling 
lessees must also comply with detailed blm or mms regulations  as applicable  governing  among other things  engineering and construction specifications for production facilities  safety procedures  plugging and abandonment of ocs wells  calculation of royalty payments and the valuation of production for this purpose and removal of facilities 
to cover the various obligations of lessees on the ocs  the mms generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met  unless the mms exempts the lessee from such obligations 
the cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and we can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases 
under certain circumstances  the blm or mms  as applicable  may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
in march  the mms issued a final rule modifying the valuation procedures for the calculation of royalties owed for crude oil sales 
when oil production sales are not in arms length transactions  the new royalty calculation will base the valuation of oil production on spot market prices instead of the posted prices that were previously utilized 
we do not believe that this rule will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by congress  states  the ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
we can give no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by the ferc will continue indefinitely 
we do not anticipate  however  that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a material or significantly adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
no material portion of forest s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
canada 
the oil and natural gas industry in canada is subject to extensive controls and regulations imposed by various levels of government 
it is not expected that any of these controls or regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other oil and gas companies of similar size 
all current legislation is a matter of public record and we are unable to predict what additional legislation or amendments may be created 
in canada  oil and natural gas exported from canada is subject to regulation by the national energy board neb  an independent federal regulatory agency and the government of canada 
exporters are free to negotiate prices and other terms with purchasers  provided that the export contracts must continue to meet certain criteria prescribed by the neb 
natural gas exports for a term of less than two years or for a term two to years in quantities of or more than  cubic meters per day  must be made pursuant to a neb order 
oil exports may be made pursuant to export contracts with terms not exceeding one year  in the case of light crude  and not exceeding two years  in the case of heavy crude  provided that an order approving any export has been obtained from the neb 
any natural gas export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration to a maximum of years or a larger quantity requires an exporter to obtain an export license from the neb  as will an oil export to be made pursuant to a contract of longer duration to a maximum of years 
the issue of such a license requires the approval of the government of canada 
the provincial governments of alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan also regulate the volume of natural gas which may be removed from those provinces for consumption elsewhere based on such factors as reserve availability  transportation arrangements and market considerations 
in addition to federal regulation  each province has legislation and regulations which govern land tenure  royalties  production rates  environmental protection and other matters 
the royalty regime is a significant factor in the profitability of oil and natural gas production 
royalties payable on production from lands other than crown lands are determined by negotiations between the mineral owner and the lessee  although production from such lands is also subject to certain provincial taxes and royalties 
crown royalties are determined by government regulation and are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of the gross production  and the rate of royalties payable generally depends in part on prescribed reference prices  well productivity  geographical location  field discovery date and the type or quality of the petroleum product produced 
the petroleum registry of alberta is a new initiative of both industry and the alberta government 
its purpose is to streamline data transfers between industry and government and industry to industry ie  partner to partner 
the initiative makes use of technology such as the internet to facilitate the transfer of regulatory and royalty data  reports and royalty payments 
concurrent with the implementation of the registry  the government of alberta imposed a new ngl royalty system for products situated in the residue gas stream 
it is the goal of this policy to maintain royalty neutrality 
as such  there appears to be minimal effect on canadian forest s royalties 
from time to time the governments of canada  alberta  british columbia and saskatchewan have established incentive programs which have included royalty rate deductions  royalty holidays and tax credits for the purpose of encouraging oil and natural gas exploration or enhanced recovery projects 
oil and natural gas royalty holidays and reductions for specific wells reduce the amount of crown royalties paid by forest to the provincial governments 
the trend in recent years has been for provincial governments to allow such programs to expire without renewal  and consequently few such programs are currently operative 
in alberta  certain producers of oil or natural gas are entitled to a credit against the royalties to the crown by virtue of the artc alberta royalty tax credit program 
the credit is determined by applying a specified rate to a maximum of million cdn of alberta crown royalties payable for each producer or associated group of producers 
the specified rate is a function of the royalty tax credit reference price which is set quarterly by the alberta department of energy and ranges from to  depending on oil and gas par prices for the previous calendar quarter 
canadian forest is eligible for artc credits only on eligible properties acquired and wells drilled after the change of control that occurred when canadian forest was acquired by forest 
production from properties acquired from corporations claiming maximum entitlement to artc will generally not be eligible 
regulation in northwest territories of canada 
the provincial governments have jurisdiction over the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the provinces of canada and the federal government has jurisdiction over the exploration and development of oil and gas resources in the canadian territories 
the federal regulatory regime reflects the extended timelines and increased capital expenditures inherent in working in the northern environment  providing for work commitments and work deposits coupled with the suspension and or reimbursement of rentals and royalties at earlier developmental stages 
this regime is subject to change as development in the northwest territories evolves toward a more conventional model 
it is possible that  at some point  jurisdiction over the oil and gas resources in these territories could be transferred to the territorial governments of the yukon  the northwest territories and nunavut 
if so  the territorial governments would have the authority to regulate the grant of drilling permits  the construction of pipelines and other matters affecting oil and gas exploration and development activities 
we are unable to predict whether any transfer of jurisdiction to the territorial governments would affect our exploration and development activities in the northwest territories  although it is possible that the territorial governments would adopt policies or regulations that could delay or limit our proposed exploration and development activities  delay or prevent the construction of pipelines or result in the payment of higher royalties or taxes than would otherwise be the case under the current federal regulatory framework 
as a result of canadian forest s activity in the northwest territories  a large royalty tax credit has been accumulated to the extent of qualified capital expenditures 
this credit can be used to eliminate royalties on existing and future producing wells 
canadian forest s right to produce oil and gas from its northwest territories properties  along with the production rights of other industry participants in these properties  is subject to conversion of certain instruments ie  exploration licenses or significant discovery licenses into production licenses on those lands which contain commercial discoveries 
the right to such conversion is not absolute and is subject to an application process and regulatory approval 
in addition  the right to produce may be dependent on the negotiation of a pooling agreement or the imposition of a forced pooling order  if other producers have rights in the spacing unit 
until the finalization of the particulars of such agreement and  or order  it would not be possible to finally determine canadian forest s share of production in such lands 
north american free trade agreement 
on january  the north american free trade agreement nafta among the governments of canada  the united states and mexico became effective 
nafta carries forward most of the material energy terms contained in the canada us free trade agreement 
in the context of energy resources  canada continues to remain free to determine whether exports to the united states or mexico will be allowed provided that any export restrictions do not i reduce the proportion of energy resource exported relative to domestic use based upon the proportion prevailing in the most recent month period  ii impose an export price higher than the domestic price  or iii disrupt normal channels of supply 
all three countries are prohibited from imposing minimum export or import price requirements 
nafta contemplates clearer disciplines on regulators to ensure fair implementation of any regulatory changes and to minimize disruption of contractual arrangements  which is important for canadian natural gas exports 
environmental matters 
extensive us federal  state and local laws  as well as law of foreign countries  govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies  such as the us environmental protection agency commonly called the epa issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws 
environmental laws and regulations are often difficult and costly to comply with and substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply 
these laws and regulations may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering an owner or lessee liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of the owner or lessee 
this regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations or earnings  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that we will not be adversely affected in the future 
the oil pollution act of opa and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in us waters 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a pipeline  vessel or onshore facility  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
opa assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages from oil spills 
opa also requires operators of offshore ocs facilities to demonstrate to the mms that they possess at least million in financial resources that are available to pay for costs that may be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
this financial responsibility amount can increase up to a maximum of million if the mms determines that a greater amount is justified based on specific risks posed by the operations or if the worst case oil spill discharge volume possible at a facility exceeds applicable threshold volumes established by the mms 
while liability limits apply in some circumstances  a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety  construction or operating regulation 
if the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup  liability limits likewise do not apply 
even if applicable  the liability limits for offshore facilities require the responsible party to pay all removal costs  plus up to million in other damages 
few defenses exist to the liability imposed by opa 
the us federal water pollution control act commonly called the clean water act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes in waters of the united states  a broadly defined term that includes all navigable waters 
many state discharge regulations and the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system generally prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and gas industry into coastal waters 
although the costs to comply with these zero discharge mandates under federal or state law may be significant  the entire industry is expected to experience similar costs and we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended commonly called cercla but also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner and operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances that have been released at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment 
in the ordinary course of forest s operations  substances may be generated that fall within the definition of hazardous substances 
although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
moreover  we may own or operate properties that in the past were operated by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
those properties and any wastes that may have been disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  and analogous state laws  and we potentially could be required to remediate such properties 
in canada  the oil and natural gas industry is currently subject to environmental regulation pursuant to provincial and federal legislation 
environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on releases or emissions of various substances produced or utilized in association with certain oil and gas industry operations 
in addition  legislation requires that well and facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities 
compliance with such legislation can require significant expenditures 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties  the revocation of licenses and authorizations or civil liability for pollution damage 
although we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above  including insuring the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to fully cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future or that such insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant environmental related event not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
we have established guidelines to be followed to comply with us and canadian environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  we have designated a compliance officer whose responsibility is to monitor regulatory requirements and their impacts on forest or canadian forest and to implement appropriate compliance procedures 
we also employ an environmental director whose responsibilities include providing assurance that our operations are carried out in accordance with applicable environmental guidelines and safety precautions 
although we maintain pollution insurance against the costs of clean up operations  public liability and physical damage  there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all such costs or that such insurance will continue to be available in the future 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue toward stricter standards 
we are committed to meeting our responsibilities to protect the environment wherever we operate and anticipate making increased expenditures as a result of increasingly stringent laws relating to the protection of the environment 
forward looking statements the information in this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts or present facts  that address activities  events  outcomes and other matters that forest plans  expects  intends  assumes  believes  budgets  predicts  forecasts  projects  estimates or anticipates and other similar expressions will  should or may occur in the future are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on management s current belief  based on currently available information  as to the outcome and timing of future events 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k  in part ii  item under the caption risk factors 
these forward looking statements appear in a number of places and include statements with respect to  among other things estimates of our future natural gas and liquids production  including estimates of any increases in oil and gas production  planned capital expenditures and availability of capital resources to fund capital expenditures  our outlook on oil and gas prices  estimates of our oil and gas reserves  the impact of political and regulatory developments  our future financial condition or results of operations and our future revenues and expenses  and our business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations 
we caution you that these forward looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of oil and gas 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved oil and natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in part ii  item under the caption risk factors 
the financial results of our foreign operations are also subject to currency exchange rate risks 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by our reservoir engineers 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously 
if significant  such revisions would change the schedule of any further production and development drilling 
accordingly  reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements express or implied  included in this form k and attributable to forest are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
this cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that forest or persons acting on its behalf may issue

see also part ii  item risk factors estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise for additional information regarding reserves 
since january  we have not filed any oil or natural gas reserve estimates or included any such estimates in reports to any federal or foreign governmental authority or agency  other than the securities and exchange commission sec and the department of energy doe 
there were no differences between the reserve estimates included in the sec report  the doe report and those included herein  except for production and additions and deletions due to the difference in the as of dates of such reserve estimates

delivery commitments a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool which is operated by promark on behalf of canadian forest 
at december   the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn 
cdn as operator of the netback pool  promark aggregates gas from producers for sale to markets across north america 
currently  over producers have contracted with the netback pool including canadian forest 
these producers have dedicated reserves and lands to the pool 
the producers are paid a blended netback price which reflects all of the revenue from approved customers less the costs of delivery including transportation  audit and shortfall makeup costs and a promark marketing fee 
canadian forest  as one of the producers in the promark netback pool  is obligated to supply its contract quantity 
in canadian forest supplied of the total netback pool sales quantity 
in the contract year  it is estimated that canadian forest will supply approximately of the netback pool quantity 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
in order to satisfy their supply obligations  the promark netback pool and canadian forest may be required to cover their obligations in the market 
as the operator of the netback pool  promark is required to acquire gas in the event of a shortfall between the gas supply and market obligations 
a shortfall could occur if a gas producer fails to deliver its dedicated share of the supply obligations of the netback pool 
the cost of purchasing gas to cover any shortfall is a cost of the netback pool 
the prices paid for shortfall gas would typically be spot market prices and may differ from the market prices received from netback pool customers 
higher spot prices would reduce the average netback pool price paid to the gas producers  including canadian forest 
shortfalls in gas produced may occur in the future 
the company does not believe that such shortfalls will be significant 
in addition to its commitments to the promark netback pool  canadian forest is committed to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices through its direct sales contracts natural gas bcf sales price per mcf

while we believe that the amount of any potential loss would not be material to our consolidated financial position  the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential loss could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow in the reporting periods in which any such actions are resolved 
on december   forest completed a merger transaction with forcenergy inc  in which forest was the surviving company 
prior to the merger with forest  forcenergy was a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the normal course of its business 
prior to the merger  on march   forcenergy and its wholly owned subsidiary  forcenergy resources inc  filed voluntarily under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
forcenergy continued to operate as a debtor in possession subject to the bankruptcy court s supervision and orders until its plan of reorganization which was confirmed on january  became effective on february  obligations of forcenergy arising out of activities prior to march   the bankruptcy petition date  will be discharged in accordance with the plan of reorganization 
pursuant to the plan of reorganization  forcenergy established a reserve of forcenergy common stock to be distributed to claimants in the event their disputed claims are ultimately determined by the bankruptcy court to be allowed claims 
the reserved shares of forcenergy common stock became forest common shares in accordance with the terms of the merger 
if the shares in the reserve are inadequate to cover all allowed claims  then under the forcenergy plan of reorganization forest would be required to issue additional shares of common stock to the holders of these claims 
forest currently believes  however  that the shares in the reserve are adequate to cover all remaining disputed claims that may be subsequently allowed 
we cannot give assurances  however  that this will be the case 
on may   the state of alaska approved the development and production phase of our redoubt shoal project the production project 
on may   cook inlet keeper  a non governmental third party  filed a challenge to the regulatory review and approval process for the production project 
in july  forest was granted leave to intervene to defend the state of alaska s approval of the production project 
in august  the court entered a briefing schedule 
that briefing has been completed  and the matter is now set for oral argument before the court on april  separately  cook inlet keeper filed a motion in september asking the court to stay forest s development and production phase operations during the pendency of the briefing process and through the court s final determination regarding the challenge 
forest filed an opposition  and the court denied cook inlet keeper s motion on december  cook inlet keeper appealed that denial to the alaska supreme court 
forest subsequently filed an opposition 
on march   the alaska supreme court remanded the matter to the trial court for clarification of the court s ruling  and postponed ruling on the petition for review until receipt of that clarification 
while we intend to continue our vigorous opposition to cook inlet keeper s challenge  the outcome of the litigation is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
we can give no assurances as to the effect of any delays in the production project on forest s financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations net earnings for were  compared to net earnings of  in the decrease in earnings was the result of lower production volumes and lower average oil and gas sales prices  offset partially by lower operating expenses 
lower production volumes were primarily the result of property sales in the fourth quarter of  hurricane downtime in the gulf of mexico and normal declines caused by reduced capital expenditures 
net earnings for were  compared to net earnings of  in the decrease in earnings was due primarily to higher deferred income tax expense in in  the income tax expense was lower due to a credit for previously unrecognized deferred tax assets 
earnings before income taxes were higher in than in as a result of higher product prices  offset partially by higher operating expense and lower production volumes 
marketing and processing  net represents the net margin earned by promark as well as processing income earned in the united states 
marketing and processing  net increased to  in from  in the increase was due primarily to gas plant income in the united states 
marketing and processing income increased to  in from  in the increase was due primarily to an increase in volumes marketed by promark in as well as higher margins on arrangements where the profit was determined as a percentage of natural gas sales prices oil and gas sales revenue decreased by to  in from  in  primarily as a result of lower product prices and production volumes 
the average sales prices received for natural gas and liquids in decreased and  respectively  compared to the average sales prices in production volumes decreased on an mcfe basis in compared to volume decreases were attributable primarily to the gulf of mexico offshore business unit 
the gulf of mexico properties were impacted by the sale of of forest s interests in the south marsh island and vermilion areas in the fourth quarter of  and also experienced hurricane downtime and normal production declines that were the result of reduced capital expenditures 
oil and gas sales revenue increased by to  in from  in due primarily to higher oil and gas prices  offset partially by lower production volumes 
the average sales prices for natural gas and liquids in increased and  respectively  compared to the average sales prices received in production volumes for natural gas and liquids on an mcfe basis decreased in compared to volume decreases were attributable primarily to normal declines and property sales affecting gulf of mexico properties 
oil and gas production expense includes direct costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities  costs of workovers that are expensed rather than capitalized because they do not extend the life of the property  product transportation costs  production taxes and ad valorem taxes 
in  production expense decreased to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to lower direct operating expense 
in production expense increased to  from  in the increase in was due primarily to increased workover activity  platform refurbishment in the gulf of mexico  pipeline maintenance in alaska  general service cost increases  higher transportation costs and higher ad valorem tax expense 
production volumes and weighted average sales prices for the years ended december   and were as follows years ended december  natural gas production mmcf united states    canada    total    sales price received per mcf effects of energy swaps and collars per mcf

hedged natural gas volumes were  mmcf   mmcf and  mmcf in  and  respectively 
hedged oil and condensate volumes were  barrels   barrels and  barrels in  and  respectively 
most of these arrangements have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and  as a result  the net gains and losses were accounted for as increases and decreases of oil and gas sales 
the aggregate net gains losses related to our cash flow hedges were   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and those arrangements that are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes are recorded as non operating income or expense 
general and administrative expense was  in compared to  in and  in total overhead costs capitalized and expensed general and administrative costs were  in compared to  in and  in the increases in were attributable primarily to increases in employee related expenses  legal expense and insurance expense  lower fixed rate overhead cost recoveries for production operations as a result of the gulf of mexico property sale and the related change in operatorship of those properties  and lower fixed rate overhead cost recoveries for drilling activities due to decreased capital spending in the period 
the decreases in were due to operating synergies associated with the merger with forcenergy and higher recoveries of overhead related to production operations and drilling activities 
the percentage of overhead capitalized remained relatively constant  at approximately during and during the percentage of overhead capitalized increased to of total overhead in compared to in the increase in the capitalization rate in was due primarily to an increase in the relative numbers of exploration and development personnel compared to administrative personnel following the merger with forcenergy 
the following table summarizes total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  in thousands overhead costs capitalized    general and administrative costs expensed    total overhead costs    number of salaried employees at end of year includes   and  in  and  respectively  related to marketing operations 
merger and seismic licensing costs of  in and  in include banking  legal  accounting  printing and other consulting costs related to the merger  severance paid to terminated employees  expenses for office closures  employee relocation  data migration and systems integration  and costs of transferring seismic licenses from forcenergy to forest 
depreciation and depletion expense was  in compared to  in the decrease was attributable primarily to lower production volumes 
on a per unit basis  the depletion rate was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in depreciation and depletion expense increased to  in from  in due primarily to a higher per unit rate 
the depletion rate increased to per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in  due primarily to capital spending and higher estimates for future development costs during the first nine months of  offset partially by a reduction in future development costs  credits to the full cost pool for property sales and increases in estimated proved reserves in the last three months of at december  forest had the following costs of undeveloped properties which were not subject to depletion united states canada international total in thousands no impairments were recorded in in  forest recorded impairments of oil and gas properties located outside north america of  of this amount  approximately  related to an unsuccessful well in albania 
impairments were also recognized in other countries based on expiration of certain concessions and evaluations of the viability of projects in those countries 
in  forest recorded an impairment of  related to unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled in switzerland and thailand 
in  there was an impairment of contract value of  related to the netback pool administered by promark 
the unamortized portion of the contract values recorded in the acquisition of promark was reduced to more closely match the remaining cash flows 
other expense of  in consisted primarily of franchise taxes 
other expense of  in consisted primarily of a reserve of  for of receivables due from enron for physical sales of natural gas 
other income of  in consisted primarily of interest income earned by forcenergy 
interest expense of  in increased  or compared to due primarily to higher debt balances that were  on average  higher  offset partially by lower interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt 
interest expense of  in decreased  or compared to due to lower average debt balances that were  on average  lower  lower rates on variable and fixed rate debt and a net gain of  recognized under interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency translation gains losses were  in   in and  in the foreign currency translation gains and losses were the result of translation of the notes issued by canadian forest and were attributable to the increases and decreases in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the periods 
forest was required to recognize the noncash foreign currency translation gains or losses related to the notes because the debt was denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of canadian forest is the canadian dollar 
all of the outstanding notes were redeemed on september  there was a realized loss on derivative instruments of  in and a realized gain on derivatives of  in the loss in was due primarily to a  net settlement of a call option related to two terminated interest rate swaps associated with our senior notes 
the gain in was due primarily to oil and natural gas prices being  in the aggregate  lower than the prices established in certain derivative contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
this gain was partially offset by a  writeoff of of the asset value of energy swaps where enron was the counterparty 
there was a net unrealized loss on derivative instruments of  in compared to a net unrealized gain on derivative instruments of  in the loss in was attributable primarily to decreases in the estimated future value of existing commodity swaps and collars as a result of increases in commodity futures prices 
the gain in represents primarily the excess of the fair value over the intrinsic value of oil and gas derivatives designated as hedges 
these realized and unrealized gains on derivative instruments were recorded separately in non operating income since the instruments do not qualify as cash flow hedges under the accounting rules governing hedging activities that were adopted in forest recorded current income tax expense of  in compared to  in and  in the decrease in compared to is due primarily to decreases in pre tax profitability and reduced state tax provisions 
the increase in compared to is due primarily to increases in pre tax profitability and higher state tax provisions 
deferred income tax expense was  in  compared with  in and  in the decrease in compared to was due primarily to reduced pre tax profitability 
the increase in compared to was due primarily to increased pre tax profitability and to the recognition in of the future income tax benefit of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in resulted from the repurchase of  principal amount of senior subordinated notes at approximately of par value  the repurchase of  principal amount of senior subordinated notes at approximately of par value  and the redemption of  outstanding principal amount of senior subordinated notes at of par value 
the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of  in resulted from the redemption of  and  principal amount of and senior subordinated notes  respectively  at and of par value  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to access cash 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity requirements through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities as well as through the issuance of debt and equity securities  when market conditions permit 
the prices we receive for future oil and natural gas production and the level of production have significant impacts on operating cash flows 
we are unable to predict with any degree of certainty the prices we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
we continually examine alternative sources of long term capital  including bank borrowings  the issuance of debt instruments  the sale of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  the issuance of net profits interests  sales of non strategic assets  prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
availability of these sources of capital and  therefore  our ability to execute our operating strategy will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
it is normal for forest to report working capital deficits at the end of a period 
such working capital deficits are principally the result of accounts payable related to exploration and development costs 
settlement of these payables is funded by cash flow from operations or  if necessary  by drawdowns on long term bank credit facilities 
forest had a working capital deficit  exclusive of the effects of derivatives  of approximately  at december  compared to a deficit of approximately  at december  the decrease in the deficit was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable due to lower exploration and development activity  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of lower production prices and decreased production 
cash flow 
historically  one of our primary sources of capital has been net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to lower product prices and decreased production 
cash used for investing activities in was  compared to  in the decrease was due primarily to decreased exploration and development activity in  offset partially by lower property sales in compared to net cash provided by financing activities in was  compared to net cash used of  in the period included net bank debt borrowings of  proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swaps of  and net proceeds of  from the issuance of the notes  offset by repurchases of the notes of  and repurchases and redemptions of the notes of  the period included net repayments of bank debt of  cash used for redemption of senior subordinated notes of  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of  and net cash inflows of  from the issuance of two series of senior notes 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in the increase was due primarily to higher production revenue as a result of higher oil and gas prices 
cash used for investing activities in was  compared to  in the increase was due primarily to increased exploration and development activity in  offset partially by an increase in property sales in net cash used by financing activities in was  compared to  in the period included net repayments of bank debt of  cash used for redemption of senior subordinated notes of  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock of  and net cash inflows of  from the issuance of two series of senior notes 
the period included net repayments of bank debt of  and net proceeds of  from forcenergy s issuance of series a cumulative preferred stock 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development were as follows years ended december  in thousands property acquisition costs proved properties   undeveloped properties  exploration costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    development costs direct costs    overhead capitalized    total capital expenditures for property acquisition  exploration and development    forest s anticipated expenditures for exploration and development in are estimated to range from  to  we intend to meet our capital expenditure financing requirements using cash flows generated by operations  sales of non strategic assets and borrowings under existing lines of credit 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will have access to sufficient capital to meet these capital requirements 
the planned levels of capital expenditures could be reduced if we experience lower than anticipated net cash provided by operations or develop other needs for liquidity  or could be increased if we experience increased cash flow or access additional sources of capital 
in addition  while we intend to continue a strategy of acquiring reserves that meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that we can locate or finance any property acquisitions 
bank credit facilities 
we have credit facilities totalling  consisting of a  us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and a  canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan bank canada 
the credit facilities mature in october under the credit facilities  forest  canadian forest and certain of their subsidiaries are subject to certain covenants and financial tests  including restrictions or requirements with respect to dividends  additional debt  liens  asset sales  investments  hedging activities  mergers and reporting responsibilities 
these finanical covenants will affect the amount available and our ability to borrow amounts under the credit facility 
in addition  if the rating on our bank credit facilities is downgraded below bb by standard poor s rating services s p and ba by moody s investors services moody s  the available borrowing amount under the credit facilities would be determined by a formula based on the value of certain oil and gas properties a borrowing base subject to semi annual re determination 
as a result  the available borrowing amount could be increased or reduced under the borrowing base tests 
under the most restrictive of the financial covenants contained in our credit facilities  the unused borrowing amount under the credit facilities at december  was approximately  in addition to amounts outstanding 
at february   under the most restrictive of these financial covenants  our unused borrowing amount under the credit facilities was approximately  at december   there were outstanding borrowings of  under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of and there were no outstanding borrowings under the canadian credit facility 
at february   the outstanding borrowings under the us credit facility were  at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were no outstanding borrowings under the canadian credit facility 
at february   forest had used the credit facilities for letters of credit in the amount of  us and  cdn 
our us credit facility is secured by a lien on  and a security interest in  a majority of our proved oil and gas properties and related assets in the united states and canada  a pledge of of the capital stock of canadian forest and its parent  canada ltd  and a pledge of of the capital stock of forest pipeline company 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
credit ratings 
our bank credit facilities and our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  s p has assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the rating agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure  and our general financial condition and prospects 
our bank credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit rating 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit ratings 
for example  if our credit rating is downgraded from its current level  the amount of credit that is available under the credit facilities will be determined by a borrowing base 
the available borrowing amount could be increased or be reduced under the borrowing base tests 
if as a result of a downgrade of our credit rating a borrowing base is established at a level below our then outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities  we would be required to repay the excess of outstanding borrowings over the newly established borrowing base 
if we were unable to pay such excess  it would cause an event of default 
the agreements governing our senior notes do not include adverse triggers that are tied to our credit ratings 
the terms of our senior notes include provisions that will allow us greater flexibility if the credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied 
in this event  we would have no further obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of such financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted 
dispositions of assets 
as a part of our ongoing operations  we routinely dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with marginal value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  during  we disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total proceeds of approximately  of this amount  approximately  related to properties located in the offshore gulf of mexico area in which we sold of our interests to unocal in connection with a strategic joint venture program 
during  forest disposed of properties with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil for total net proceeds of  termination of interest rate swaps 
during  forest terminated two interest rate swaps related to its senior notes and one interest rate swap related to its senior notes 
we received net proceeds of approximately  related to those terminations  which amount was used for general corporate purposes 
from inception to september   the effective rates on forest s senior notes due and were reduced to and  respectively  as a result of the original swaps 
from october   to maturity  the effective rates on the senior notes due and will be reduced to and  respectively  as a result of amortization of the gain related to termination of those swaps 
from date of issuance to december   the effective rate on forest s senior notes was reduced to approximately as a result of the original swap 
from december   to maturity  the effective rate on the senior notes will be reduced to approximately as a result of amortization of the gain related to termination of the swap 
securities issued 
in the second quarter of  we issued  principal amount of senior notes due at of par for proceeds of  net of related issuance costs 
a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our us credit facility and to repurchase  principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in january  we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering before any exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  were approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses of the offering 
forest used the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase  immediately following the closing of the offering   shares from the anschutz corporation and certain of its affiliates 
the shares repurchased were cancelled immediately upon repurchase 
in february  an additional  shares of common stock were issued pursuant to exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
the net proceeds of  were used for general corporate purposes 
securities redeemed and repurchased 
during  we repurchased  principal amount of senior subordinated notes at approximately of par value   principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at approximately of par value  and redeemed  outstanding principal amount of senior subordinated notes at of par value  resulting in an aggregate loss of  in january we redeemed the remaining  outstanding principal amount of our senior subordinated notes at of par value  resulting in a loss of  recorded in the first quarter of during we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share pursuant to our odd lot stock buyback program

in addition to the above commitments  we are committed to make approximately  of capital expenditures over the next three years pursuant to the terms of an exploration agreement in canada and other foreign concession arrangements 
nonperformance under these agreements could result in the loss of acreage and concession rights 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease

the mms determines whether each lessee is financially capable of paying the estimated costs of such plugging and abandonment liabilities 
we annually provide the mms with our financial information 
if we do not satisfy the mms requirements  we could be required to post supplemental bonds 
in the past  forest has not been required to post supplemental bonds  however  we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the financial tests and remain on the list of mms lessees exempt from the supplemental bonding requirements 
we cannot predict or quantify the amount of any such supplemental bonds or the annual premiums related thereto  but the amount could be substantial 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
effective january  using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
we currently record estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and similar activities as part of our provision for depreciation and depletion for oil and gas properties without recording a separate liability for such amounts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we expect to record an increase to net properties and equipment between million and million  an asset retirement obligation liability between million and million  and a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle between an after tax charge of million and an after tax gain of million 
statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
 was issued in april this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
as a result  the criteria in apb will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we expect adoption of this statement to result in the reclassification of losses on extinguishment of debt for all periods from extraordinary to other income and expense 
statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 was issued in june sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
will be effective for forest in january we expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have no impact on our financial statements 
eitf issue no 
 recognition and reporting of gains and losses on energy trading contracts under eitf issues no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and no 
 measuring the fair value of energy related contracts in applying issue no 
 was issued in june eitf issue no 
addresses certain issues related to energy trading activities  including a gross versus net presentation in the income statement  b whether the initial fair value of an energy trading contract can be other than the price at which it was exchanged  and c accounting for inventory utilized in energy trading activities 
certain provisions of eitf issue no 
relating to gross versus net presentations were effective for forest in the third quarter of and  accordingly  we have presented our revenue and expenses from marketing and processing activities as a net revenue line item in the accompanying statements of operations 
the remaining provisions effective january  will have no impact on our financial statements 
statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 was issued in december the statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
sfas no 
does not change the provisions of sfas no 
that permit entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
our accounting for stock based compensation will not change as a result of sfas no 
as we intend to continue following the provisions of apb sfas no 
does require certain new disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
the required annual disclosures are effective immediately and have been included in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the new interim disclosure provisions will be effective in the first quarter of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  forest is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 was issued in january the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on how to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors forest has made in this form k  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements include statements  among others  about forest s operations  performance and financial results and condition  as described in more detail in part i  item of this form k  under the heading forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed below and elsewhere in this form k and in forest s other public filings  press releases and discussions with forest s management 
forest undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this form k  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating forest 
oil and gas price declines and their volatility could adversely affect forest s revenue  cash flows and profitability 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
forest s revenues  profitability and future rate of growth depend substantially upon the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
increases and decreases in prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow from banks may be subject to redetermination based on changes in prices 
in addition  we may have ceiling test writedowns when prices decline 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that forest can produce economically 
any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices 
factors that can cause price fluctuations include relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  particularly those in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of oil and gas imports  or general economic conditions 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas  we enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of one year or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices rise substantially over the price established by the arrangements 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our future contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
for further information concerning prices  market conditions and energy swap and collar agreements  see part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk of this form k  and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain parties with whom we have long term and short term contracts may fail to perform 
we have long term and short term contracts  including agreements for the sale of oil and natural gas 
in  we expect that our sales contracts may be concentrated among a smaller number of parties 
for example  in we anticipate that we will sell our oil production in the cook inlet area to a single refiner  tesoro alaska petroleum company and its affiliate 
these parties could fail to perform their contractual obligations as a result of circumstances that are beyond our control 
our ability to enforce these contractual obligations may be adversely affected by bankruptcy and other creditors rights laws 
we cannot guarantee that our oil and gas purchasers will not experience material changes in their financial condition that would impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts and efficiently market our oil and gas production 
we may not be able to obtain adequate financing to execute our operating strategy 
we have historically addressed our long term liquidity needs through the use of bank credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities as well as through the issuance of debt and equity securities when market conditions permit 
we continue to examine the following alternative sources of long term capital bank borrowings or the issuance of debt securities  the issuance of common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities  the issuance of nonrecourse production based financing or net profits interests  sales of non strategic properties  sales of prospects and technical information  and joint venture financing 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  oil and natural gas prices and the value and performance of forest 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we spend and will continue to spend a substantial amount of capital for the development  exploration  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas reserves 
our capital expenditures for exploration and development during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we expect such capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million 
if low oil and natural gas prices  drilling or production delays  operating difficulties or other factors  many of which are beyond our control  cause our revenues and cash flows from operations to decrease  we may be limited in our ability to spend the capital necessary to complete our drilling and development program 
in addition  if availability under our credit facilities is reduced as a result of the covenants and financial tests contained in the agreements  our ability to fund our planned capital expenditures could be adversely affected 
after utilizing our available sources of financing  we could be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such expenditures 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet these requirements 
a curtailment of capital spending could adversely affect our ability to replace production and our future cash flow from operations 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the securities and exchange commission relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth 
in certain situations  hydrocarbon reservoirs underlying our properties may extend beyond the boundaries of our own acreage to adjacent acreage owned by others 
in this case  our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by the operators on those adjacent properties 
also  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenue  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves will likely vary from the estimates used 
such variances may be material 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped compared to at december  recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
in estimating our proved reserves we have assumed that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our oil and gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the results will be as estimated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current market value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the securities and exchange commission to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor for forest 
the effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with forest or the oil and gas industry in general will affect the appropriateness of the discount factor 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is a complex subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and their recoverability that cannot be measured in an exact way 
such process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the interpretation of such data 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise and different reserve engineers may analyze the same data and determine different reserve estimates 
for example  we engaged ryder scott company  independent petroleum engineers  to review our process as well as our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  future net cash flows and discounted future net cash flows at december  upon consummation of that review  ryder scott provided us with their opinion indicating that  on an aggregate basis  our estimates of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows complied with the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the securities and exchange commission and were prepared in accordance with generally accepted procedures for the estimation of future reserves and that such estimates fairly reflected the estimated net reserves owned by us 
as part of its review  ryder scott established an acceptable variance and determined that forest s estimates were within this variance 
in the aggregate  ryder scott s estimates of reserve quantities were lower than forest s by approximately 
leverage will materially affect our operations 
as of december   our long term debt was approximately million  including approximately million outstanding under our global bank credit facilities with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and jp morgan bank canada 
our long term debt represented of our total capitalization at december  our level of debt affects our operations in several important ways  including the following a significant portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit our ability to borrow additional funds  to dispose of assets  or to pay dividends  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  and the terms of the agreements governing our debt permit our creditors to accelerate payments upon an event of default including an event of default under other agreements or a change of control 
in addition  we may alter our capitalization significantly in order to make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
these changes in capitalization may increase our level of debt significantly 
a high level of debt increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and to reduce our level of debt depends on our future performance 
general economic conditions and financial  business and other factors affect our operations  our future performance and our ability to raise additional capital 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  or repay such debt with the proceeds of any equity offering 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future debt or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
in addition  if our bank credit facility rating is downgraded  our ability to borrow under our credit facilities would be subject to a borrowing base that would be re determined semi annually 
if  following such a re determination  our outstanding borrowings exceeded the amount of the re determined borrowing base  we would be forced to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings in excess of the re determined borrowing base 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we are not able to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or to arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  our credit ratings and our value and performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering or refinancing can be successfully completed 
lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation writedowns 
we use the full cost method of accounting to report our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling test writedown 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our shareholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  writedowns may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values  if estimated future development costs increase or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test writedowns in the future 
we may incur significant abandonment costs or be required to post substantial performance bonds in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells  platforms and pipelines 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on our oil and gas properties  pro rata to our working interest 
prior to january  we provided for expected future abandonment liabilities by accruing for such costs as a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
we also accounted for these future liabilities by including all projected abandonment costs as a reduction in the future cash flows from our reserves in our reserve reporting 
as of january   after adoption of sfas no 
 our asset retirement obligation liability is estimated to be approximately million to million  primarily for properties in offshore gulf of mexico and alaska waters 
approximately million of abandonment costs are anticipated to be incurred in  all of which are expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
estimates of abandonment costs and their timing may change due to many factors  including actual drilling and production results  inflation rates  changes in abandonment techniques and technology  and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
gulf of mexico reservoirs experience steep declines  while the declines in long lived fields in other regions are lower 
production from gulf of mexico reservoirs represented approximately of our total production in our reserves will decline as they are produced unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
forest s future natural gas and oil production is highly dependent upon its level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain 
we may be unable to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
we cannot assure you that our future exploration  development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
our operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and gas drilling and production activities 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be found 
the cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain 
oil and gas drilling and production activities may be shortened  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  geological irregularities or pressure in formations  equipment failures or accidents  weather conditions  shortages in labor  and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits 
the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
we cannot assure you that the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 
drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable 
drilling activities can result in dry wells and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs 
our redoubt shoal prospect in alaska is an important property on which we have spent and have budgeted to spend substantial amounts 
our discovery at redoubt shoal in the cook inlet of alaska is an important property on which we have recorded in excess of mmbbls of estimated proved reserves and where we spent substantial amounts to commence production operations in december in order to complete the construction of our facilities and conduct ongoing operations in the cook inlet area  we have obtained various federal and state governmental approvals  permits and licenses and entered into agreements with individual landowners 
a third party has commenced a legal challenge to the regulatory review and approval process for the development and production phase of our redoubt shoal project 
the outcome of this litigation is inherently difficult to predict with any certainty 
the litigation could result in a court ordering a temporary halt in production 
we cannot predict the effect of a curtailment of production for a significant period of time on our financial condition and results of operations 
see part i  item of this form k for additional information concerning this litigation 
we may be restrained in our ability to market production due to the availability  proximity and capacity limits of pipelines 
there currently is only one crude oil refiner  tesoro alaska petroleum company  located in the cook inlet area 
if we are unable to sell to this refiner we would be forced to market our production through other sources with the result that we might be forced to sell our production at a lower net price 
once construction at our kustatan onshore production facility is complete  all redoubt shoal production will flow through that single facility 
the facility is a new project and we may experience problems in its start up 
since a significant portion of our oil recovery at redoubt shoal will come from a secondary recovery water injection program  there is risk that ultimate recovery will vary from our estimates based on the performance of the water injection program 
also  we intend to continue to drill additional wells to develop this field 
we are currently drilling and producing from a single platform 
any difficulties in production or drilling operations could adversely affect both 
in addition  the area in which we operate in alaska may experience volcanic activity  tremors and earthquakes 
depending on the severity of these types of disturbances  they could cause substantial damage to our facilities and interrupt production 
our industry experiences numerous operating risks 
the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas involves risks 
these operating risks include the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failure  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards 
environmental hazards include oil spills  gas leaks  pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these industry operating risks occur  we could have substantial losses 
substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
for example  a substantial portion of our oil and gas operations is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
the gulf of mexico area experiences tropical weather disturbances  some of which can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the profitability of our gas marketing activities may be limited 
our operations include gas marketing through our subsidiary  promark 
promark s gas marketing operations consist of the marketing of gas production in canada  the purchase and direct sale of third parties natural gas  the handling of transportation and operations of third party gas and spot purchasing and selling of natural gas 
the profitability of such natural gas marketing operations depends on our ability to assess and respond to changing market conditions  including credit risk 
profitability also depends on our ability to maximize the volume of third party natural gas that we purchase and resell or exchange and to obtain a satisfactory fee for service or margin between the negotiated purchase price and the sales price for such volumes 
if we are unable to respond accurately to changing conditions in the gas marketing business  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
promark does not buy or sell gas to hold as a speculative position 
all transactions are immediately offset  establishing the margin to be earned 
promark is exposed to credit risk because the counterparties to agreements might not perform their contractual obligations 
our international operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations and economic and political developments 
we have significant oil and gas operations in canada 
the expenses of such operations  which represented approximately of consolidated cash costs of oil and gas operations  are payable in canadian dollars 
most of the revenue from canadian natural gas and oil sales  which represented of total oil and gas revenue in  is based upon us dollars price indices 
as a result  canadian operations are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian and us dollars 
we have also acquired additional oil and gas assets in other countries 
although there are no material operations in these countries  our foreign operations may also be adversely affected by political and economic developments  royalty and tax increases and other laws or policies in these countries  as well as us policies affecting trade  taxation and investment in other countries 
in south africa we have an interest in offshore properties with the potential for gas production 
no proved reserves have been assigned to these properties as commercial sales contracts have not been established 
if we are unable to arrange for commercial use of these properties  we may not be able to recoup our investment and will not realize our anticipated financial and operating results for these properties 
competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
forest competes with major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and the equipment and labor required to develop and operate such properties 
forest also competes with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
our future acquisitions may not contain economically recoverable reserves 
our recent growth is due in part to our merger with forcenergy in and acquisitions of producing properties 
a successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with such assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  the review will not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every platform or well 
even when a platform or well is inspected  structural and environmental problems are not necessarily discovered 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
in addition  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources which are substantially greater than those available to us 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that we will acquire such properties at acceptable prices 
there are uncertainties in successfully integrating our acquisitions 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and retaining and assimilating the employees 
in addition  although we perform a diligent review of the properties acquired in connection with such acquisitions in accordance with industry practices  such reviews are inherently incomplete 
these reviews may not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to fully assess the deficiencies and potential associated with the properties 
any of these or similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results 
the marketability of our production depends largely upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
transportation space on such gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited and at times unavailable due to repairs or improvements being made to such facilities or due to such space being utilized by other companies with priority transportation agreements 
the available capacity  or lack of available capacity  on these systems and facilities  could result in the shutting in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
our access to transportation options can also be affected by us federal and state and canadian regulation of oil and gas production and transportation  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand 
these factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control 
if market factors dramatically change  the financial impact on forest could be substantial and could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various governmental regulations that materially affect our operations 
our oil and gas operations are subject to various us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial governmental regulations 
these regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions 
matters regulated include permits for discharges of wastewaters and other substances generated in connection with drilling operations  bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well plugging and abandonment costs  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  and unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
at various times  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on oil and gas production 
in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas  these agencies have restricted the rates of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production capacity 
in addition  the federal oil pollution act opa  as amended  requires operators of offshore facilities to prove that they have the financial capability to respond to costs that may be incurred in connection with potential oil spills 
under the opa and other federal and state environmental statutes  owners and operators of certain defined facilities are strictly liable for such spills of oil and other regulated substances  subject to certain limitations 
a substantial spill from one of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
us and non us laws regulate production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and gas  by products from oil and gas and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and gas operations 
we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
the significant ownership position of anschutz could limit forest s ability to enter into certain transactions 
as of february   the anschutz corporation and its affiliates anschutz owned approximately of our outstanding common stock  in addition to options to purchase  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
two of forest s directors are officers of anschutz 
therefore  anschutz may substantially influence matters being considered by forest and its board of directors 
because of anschutz s stock ownership and board positions  a third party probably would not offer to pay a premium to acquire forest without the prior agreement of anschutz  even if the board of directors should choose to attempt to sell forest in the future 
in addition  if shareholder approval would be required by new york stock exchange rules  anschutz s opposition to such a transaction could significantly reduce the likelihood of its approval 
we do not pay dividends 
we have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock in a number of years and have no intention to do so in the near future 
in addition  we are limited in the amount we can pay by our global credit agreement and the indentures pursuant to which our subordinated notes were issued 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws have provisions that discourage corporate takeovers and could prevent shareholders from realizing a premium on their investment 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws and provisions of the new york business corporation law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
our directors are elected to staggered terms 
also  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights of those shares as the board may determine 
additional provisions include restrictions on business combinations  the availability of authorized but unissued common stock and notice requirements for shareholder proposals and director nominations 
these provisions  alone or in combination with each other and with the rights plan described below  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to shareholders for their common stock 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
the existence of the rights plan may impede a takeover of forest not supported by the board of directors  including a proposed takeover that may be desired by a majority of our shareholders or involving a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and assumptions alternatives exist among accounting methods we use to report our financial results 
the choice of an accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
in addition  application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  depreciation and amortization  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties  the valuation of deferred tax assets  and the estimation of fair values for derivative instruments 
the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions and the potential effects thereof are further described in risk factors estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise in this item and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
full cost method of accounting 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
a reserve is also provided for estimated future development costs related to proved reserves and for estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment as a component of depletion expense 
changes in estimates of reserves  future development costs or future abandonment costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties  including related capitalized interest costs  are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
where proved reserves are established  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limitation which is based on the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
to the extent the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  the excess is charged to earnings 
changes in estimates of discounted future net revenues will affect the calculation of the ceiling limitation 
we did not have any writedowns related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of our oil and gas properties by approximately  in the us and  cdn in canada 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and approximately per mcf in canada and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us and approximately per barrel in canada 
a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation in the us and canada and could result in a ceiling test writedown 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion and amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
as of december   costs related to these international projects of approximately  were not being depleted pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
in no impairments were recorded 
in  we recorded an impairment of  related to the concessions in albania  australia  italy  romania  tunisia and thailand 
in we recorded an impairment of  related to unsuccessful exploratory wells drilled in switzerland and thailand 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
a reserve is provided for estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment activities as a component of depletion 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
we believe the full cost method is the appropriate method to use to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities 
we conduct significant exploration programs in the gulf of mexico  the cook inlet area of alaska  frontier areas in canada and in various international regions 
we believe the full cost method more appropriately treats the costs of these exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
fair values of derivative instruments 
we periodically hedge a portion of our oil and gas production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk 
we recognize the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
the accounting treatment of the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge 
for cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges to the extent the hedge is effective  there is no effect on the statement of operations because changes in fair value of the derivative offset changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as non operating income or expense 
the estimation of fair values for our hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the fair values of our derivatives are estimated on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
the option pricing model uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using estimated weighted average cost of the debt 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as to changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
we account for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon our ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether we have taken our ownership share of such volumes 
we record a receivable or a liability to the extent we receive less or more than our share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue is recorded based on volumes taken by us or allocated to us by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than our ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates are adjusted to reflect any overproduced or underproduced positions 
receivables or payables are recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between forest and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales allows for recognition of revenue based on forest s actual share of jointly owned production  and matches revenue with related operating expenses 
in addition  it provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
at december   forest had taken approximately mmcf more than its entitled share of production 
the estimated value of this imbalance of approximately  was recorded as a long term liability 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize its united states net deferred tax asset at december   the company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards in to based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada and  through promark  our marketing subsidiary  we market natural gas for third parties in canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices  we enter into long term contracts for a portion of our production and use a hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  forest enters into commodity swaps  collars and other financial instruments 
all of our commodity swaps and collar agreements and a portion of our basis swaps in place at december  have been designated as cash flow hedges 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
we periodically assess the estimated portion of our anticipated production that is subject to hedging arrangements  and we adjust this percentage based on our assessment of market conditions and the availability of hedging arrangements that meet our criteria 
hedging arrangements covered  and of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
long term sales contracts 
a significant portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold through the promark netback pool which is operated by promark on behalf of canadian forest 
at december   the promark netback pool had entered into fixed price contracts to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn cdn 
cdn as operator of the netback pool  promark aggregates gas from producers for sale to markets across north america 
currently  over producers have contracted with the netback pool including canadian forest 
the producers are paid a netback price which reflects all of the revenue from approved customers less the costs of delivery including transportation  audit and shortfall makeup costs and a promark marketing fee 
canadian forest  as one of the producers in the netback pool  is obligated to supply its contract quantity 
in  canadian forest supplied of the total netback pool sales quantity 
in the contract year  it is estimated that canadian forest will supply approximately of the netback pool quantity 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
in order to satisfy their supply obligations  the promark netback pool and canadian forest may be required to cover their obligations in the market 
as the operator of the netback pool  promark is required to acquire gas in the event of a shortfall between the gas supply and market obligations 
a shortfall could occur if a gas producer fails to deliver its contractual share of the supply obligations of the netback pool 
the cost of purchasing gas to cover any shortfall is a cost of the netback pool 
the prices paid for shortfall gas would typically be spot market prices and may differ from the market prices received from netback pool customers 
higher spot prices would reduce the average netback pool price paid to the gas producers  including canadian forest 
shortfalls in gas produced may occur in the future 
the company does not believe that such shortfalls will be significant 
in addition to its commitments to the promark netback pool  canadian forest is committed to sell natural gas at the following quantities and weighted average prices natural gas bcf sales price per mcf

cdn hedging program 
in a typical commodity swap agreement  forest receives the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower 
if the index price is higher  forest pays the difference 
by entering into swap agreements we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   forest had entered into the following swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas oil nymex wti bbtus per day average hedged price per mmbtu barrels per day average hedged price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  between january  and march   we entered into the following swaps accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas bbtus per day average hedged price per mmbtu first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we also enter into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
collars are also settled in cash  either on a monthly basis or at the end of their terms 
by entering into collars we effectively provide a floor for the price that we will receive for the hedged production  however  the collar also establishes a maximum price that we will receive for the hedged production if prices increase above the ceiling price 
we enter into collars during periods of volatile commodity prices in order to protect against a significant decline in prices in exchange for forgoing the benefit of price increases in excess of the ceiling price on the hedged production 
as of december   forest had entered into the following gas and oil collars accounted for as cash flow hedges natural gas bbtus per day average floor price per mmbtu average ceiling price per mmbtu first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter oil nymex wti barrels per day average floor price per bbl average ceiling price per bbl first quarter  second quarter  third quarter  fourth quarter  first quarter  between january  and march   we did not enter into any collars accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we also use basis swaps to fix the differential price between the nymex price and the index price at which the hedged gas is sold 
as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for and weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for between january  and march   we entered into basis swaps designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtu s per day for the fair value of our cash flow hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a loss of approximately   after tax which was recorded to other comprehensive income 
as of december   forest had entered into basis swaps that were not designated as cash flow hedges with weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for and weighted average volumes of bbtus per day for between january  and march  we did not enter into any additional basis swaps not designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of our derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a loss of approximately  trading activities 
profits or losses generated by the purchase and sale of third parties gas are based on the spread between the prices of natural gas purchased and sold 
promark does not trade natural gas to hold as a speculative or open position 
all transactions represent physical volumes and are immediately offset  thereby fixing the margin and eliminating the market risk on the related agreements 
at december   promark s trading operations had the following purchase and sales commitments in place for natural gas bcf purchase price per mcf sales price per mcf cdn cdn foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily us dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
interest rate risk the following table presents principal amounts and related average fixed interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  total fair value dollar amounts in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate      coupon interest rate effective interest rate on january  forest redeemed all of its outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the redemption was funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility 
the effective interest rate on senior notes due  the senior notes due and the senior notes due will be reduced from the coupon rate as a result of amortization of the gain related to termination of the related interest rate swaps
