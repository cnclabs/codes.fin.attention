in addition  a new batch plant was purchased to replace the existing facility in brighton  colorado 
the new plant will be operational in the first half of during  work was performed on the aforementioned projects and the company also invested approximately  for a new office building in colton

a revolving credit facility of up to  is available for seasonal needs including the funding of seasonal sales programs related to the furnace and evaporative cooler product lines 
the line is also used for stand by letters of credit to insurance carriers in support of self insured amounts under the company s risk management program 
borrowings are unsecured and bear interest at prime or a performance based libor rate 
currently such performance based rate is libor plus for the term loan and libor plus for the revolving credit facility 
effective december   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement agreement in order to fix the floating interest rate characteristic of most of the company s term loan borrowings 
the company s current interest rate under the agreement is 
such rate is subject to adjustment depending upon the company s performance 
the company concluded that it was appropriate to take advantage of the interest rate environment and fix the interest rate at a relatively low level for a five year period 
the company believes that existing cash balances and anticipated cash flow  supplemented by seasonal borrowings against the revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
operations vs 
consolidated sales in declined  or  to  excluding the sales of mdhi  acquired on april   the sales decline would have been approximately 
the sales of the construction materials segment declined  while sales of the heating and air conditioning segment increased   compared to the previous year 
the reduction in the construction materials segment was across the three main markets in colorado as construction continued to decline along the front range of colorado 
the modest increase in the heating and air conditioning segment was the result of strong evaporative cooler sales and slightly improved furnace sales offset by reduced sales of fan coils 
the increase in evaporative cooler sales was primarily due to the addition of a large new retail customer 
fan coil sales declined reflecting the nationwide slump in commercial construction  notably hotel construction 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during  which the company expects to continue into during  inflation was not a significant factor at any of the operations except that employee health care costs and general business insurance premiums dramatically outpaced the rate of inflation 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
the increase was primarily experienced in the construction materials segment 
the declining construction activity along the front range in colorado had the effect of increasing price competition resulting in lower prices per yard 
some of the aggregates operations experienced increased costs as well 
higher costs were incurred in the pueblo gravel operation as a now depleted gravel site was closed and start up costs at the new site exceeded expectations 
in addition  initial yields of primary products at the new pueblo gravel site are less than that experienced at the company s other gravel operations 
additional costs were also incurred in dismantling the old aggregates plant 
finally  a plant breakdown at one of the aggregates operations during the first quarter of and a brief shut down prior to bringing the new sand plant on line in colorado springs added to the increased costs 
the increase in the heating and air conditioning segment is due to a change in product mix and the  write down of inventories and other costs associated with a product manufactured at our phoenix plant 
selling and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at  as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses increased slightly to 
the decline in operating income from  to  is primarily due to the decreased sales  the heightened competition in colorado  the aforementioned increased costs at three of the construction aggregate operations and the inventory write down 
the  decrease in other income is primarily the result of  of gains realized on sales of depleted or not exploitable aggregate properties in colorado during compared to  of gains on sales during the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory rates adjusted for non deductible and other tax items 
the lower effective rate in was due to the benefit of california enterprise zone credits as discussed below 
also see note operations vs 
consolidated sales in increased  or  to  the sales of the construction materials segment increased  due primarily to the acquisition of rmrm 
sales at the company s other construction materials sites declined due to cold weather during the first quarter of and a decline in commercial construction in the colorado springs market 
the heating and air conditioning segment sales improved  or  compared to the previous year 
the increase in the heating and air conditioning segment was due to evaporative cooler sales that improved from the depressed conditions encountered in  while a small improvement in the furnace line due to cold weather during the first quarter of was more than offset by a decline in fan coil sales as a result of a slow down in commercial construction 
the company experienced a high level of price competition in all of its product lines during during  inflation was not a significant factor at any of the operations 
cost of sales exclusive of depreciation  depletion and amortization  as a percent of sales  increased from to 
this slight increase was experienced in both segments 
the reduced fan coil sales and heightened competition in the furnace product line resulted in increases in costs as a percentage of sales that more than offset the improvement in the evaporative cooler line in the heating and air conditioning segment 
the addition of rmrm was the main factor in the construction materials segment increase as their cost of sales ratio has historically exceeded that experienced by the company s other construction materials operations in southern colorado 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased from  to  due to the purchase of rmrm 
selling and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to the acquisition of rmrm 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses declined from to 
rmrm was also the major factor in the percentage improvement as its relationship of selling and administrative expense to sales is relatively low  similar to the company s other construction materials sites 
contributing to the improvement was a reduction of the selling and administrative expense level at williams furnace co  which was largely due to personnel reductions 
the improved operating income primarily reflects the contribution of rmrm 
an additional increase from the evaporative cooler product line more that offset the decline experienced in the furnace and fan coil product lines 
interest expense increased  to  reflecting the increased debt resulting from the acquisition of rmrm 
other income is primarily the result of gains from sales of aggregate properties in colorado that were either depleted or not exploitable and miscellaneous equipment sales 
these gains totaled  and  for and  respectively 
the sale of one large depleted aggregate property was the primary cause of the increase in other income in the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory rates adjusted for state tax credits  non deductible and other tax items 
see note the reduction from the prior year s rate of is due to california enterprise zone credits earned during the years through the benefit of these credits for prior and future years reduced the effective rate by 
application of the credits against the tax due on the current year s earnings reduced the rate by and is included in the noted as state income taxes  net of federal benefit line in note related party transactions the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general and product liability together with another company controlled by or related to the company s principal shareholders to minimize insurance costs and to obtain other more favorable terms

see paragraph below 
while the notional amount of the swap is generally below the outstanding balance of the term loan  the scheduled decreases in the notional amount do not coincide with the scheduled payments on the term loan 
this disparity caused the notional amount to exceed the outstanding term loan balance by  at december  the effect of this timing disparity is not material to the results of operations 
at december   the notional amount subject to this agreement is  see above discussion under financial condition  liquidity and capital resources
