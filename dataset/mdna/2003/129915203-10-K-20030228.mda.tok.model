item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the following consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which commence on page f overview the company is a residential land development and homebuilding company with properties located primarily in southern california 
the principal activities of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries include i obtaining zoning and other entitlements for land it owns and improving the land for residential development  and ii designing  constructing and selling single family residential homes in southern california 
once the residential land owned by the company is entitled  the company may build homes  sell unimproved land to other developers or homebuilders  sell improved land to homebuilders  or participate in joint ventures with other developers  investors or homebuilders to finance and construct infrastructure and homes 
during  the company will focus its immediate efforts to i obtain approval from the california coastal commission coastal commission for development permits to build homes on the upper bench of the bolsa chica mesa upper mesa  as further described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  and ii maintain profitable homebuilding operations 
however  the company may also consider other strategic and joint venture opportunities  and there can be no assurance that the company will accomplish  in whole or in part  all or any of these strategic goals 
during and  the company generated gross operating margins from homebuilding activities and cash flows on assets other than bolsa chica 
the company currently has on going southern california projects in riverside county near the cities of north corona and riverside 
during october  the company acquired additional residential lots at the north corona project and entered into escrows to acquire additional lots at the riverside project and lots in the city of chino in san bernardino county 
these homebuilding projects are expected to generate significant cash flows and modest gross operating margins through however  the company s inventory of entitled land available for homebuilding projects is still limited 
given this limited inventory of buildable lots  the company is continuing to pursue residential lot acquisition opportunities 
due to delays in approvals for homebuilding at bolsa chica  continuation of homebuilding operations beyond is dependent upon acquisition of suitable  entitled residential lots within the southern california area or coastal commission approval of the company s development plan for homes on the upper mesa 
bolsa chica is the company s principal asset  representing of total assets at december  it has required and continues to require significant investments for entitlement and land development activities 
due to the november coastal commission decision to limit residential development to only the upper mesa  the company is faced with further delays in implementing its plans for residential development on the bolsa chica mesa 
the company is currently pursuing approval of development permits for the upper mesa 
on may   the county of orange planning commission approved the company s site plan for development of single family homes on the upper mesa 
in response to an appeal  on july   the orange county board of supervisors upheld the planning commission s prior approval of the site plan and tentative tract map 
this development plan also requires approval by the coastal commission 
the company submitted a cdp application for this plan to the coastal commission in november the company is currently responding to comments from the coastal commission staff to have its cdp application deemed complete and currently expects the coastal commission to hold a public hearing on the cdp later this year 
the company does not believe that the coastal commission process will ultimately prevent it from developing a planned community at bolsa chica  however  there can be no assurance in that regard  or as to when development could commence  or as to the number of acres or homes the company will be permitted to develop  or that further litigation or administrative delay will not result 
the bolsa chica land trust and other environmental groups have periodically suggested that the company consider selling the bolsa chica mesa to a nonprofit corporation or the state of california 
historically  there has been no source of funding to finance such a transaction 
however  on november  voters approved a billion bond measure on california s ballot known as proposition and entitled the water quality  supply and safe drinking water projects 
coastal wetlands purchase and protection 
bonds 
the bond initiative includes an unquantified line item for the state of california to pursue the acquisition of all or a part of the bolsa chica mesa 
while the state has indicated it will conduct an appraisal of the bolsa chica mesa  there can be no assurances that the company will ever receive an offer from the state for the bolsa chica mesa  reach a mutually acceptable agreement on price and terms  or that a sale transaction will ever be completed 
the company believes that the bolsa chica mesa can ultimately be developed and will realize an amount that is substantially in excess of the million book value presently reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  although there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company also believes that the current and historic public trading prices of the company s common stock have not adequately reflected the mesa s true value 
from time to time  the company has received outside appraisals on an as developed basis which have supported the company s beliefs 
therefore  the company has no present intention of selling the mesa to the state at any price that is not substantially in excess of present book value 
real estate held for current development or sale and land held for future development real estate properties are carried at fair value as of september   following adoption of fresh start reporting as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  as adjusted by subsequent activity 
the company s real estate properties are subject to a number of uncertainties which can affect the values of those assets 
these uncertainties include litigation or appeals of regulatory approvals as discussed above and availability of adequate capital  financing and cash flow 
in addition  future values may be adversely affected by increases in property taxes  increases in the costs of labor and materials and other development risks  changes in general economic conditions  including higher mortgage interest rates  and other real estate risks such as the general demand for housing and the supply of competitive products 
real estate properties do not constitute liquid assets and  at any given time  it may be difficult to sell a particular property for an appropriate price 
impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions real estate and residential housing prices are affected by inflation  which can cause increases in the price of land  raw materials and subcontracted labor 
unless these increased costs are recovered through higher sales prices  gross margin from home sales would decrease 
if interest rates increase  construction and financing costs  as well as the cost of borrowings  also would increase  which can also result in lower gross margin from home sales 
the volatility of interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company s future operations and liquidity 
among other things  these conditions may affect adversely the demand for housing and the availability of mortgage financing and may reduce the credit facilities offered to the company 
during the last six months of it became apparent that both the national and california economies were in a recession  and economic data for did not yield convincing evidence of an economic recovery 
therefore  there can be no assurance regarding the continued health of the southern california residential real estate market 
in particular  i the slow down in the national economy during the past months  ii the significant decreases in the value of national stock market indices and the resulting volatility of those markets  iii the events of september  and their continuing effects on the economy  iv economic uncertainty related to prospects for a war with iraq  and v the state of california s billion estimated budget deficit  collectively appear to be exerting recessionary pressures on the california economy and may have a negative impact on the southern california housing market 
while low mortgage rates appear to have sustained housing demand to date  any future increase in mortgage rates or significant loss of jobs in southern california would most likely slow demand for new homes 
increases in home mortgage interest rates make it more difficult for the company s customers to qualify for home mortgage loans  potentially decreasing home sales volume and prices 
the tight supply of new homes in southern california has resulted in significant home price increases over the last five years 
as a result  the affordability of new homes has been declining and could further jeopardize future demand 
all of the company s active homebuilding projects are located in the inland empire area of southern california  which includes riverside and san bernardino counties 
the inland empire has experienced significant population and job growth in the past decade 
while continued growth is expected  partially due to the limited supply of affordably priced housing in coastal areas such as orange county  there can be no assurance that economic  demographic or other factors will not slow  diminish or cause such growth to discontinue 
the company is continuing to pursue lot acquisition opportunities throughout southern california 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  the company applies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies that the company believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
the company s critical accounting policies include the evaluation of the impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by its significant federal tax net operating losses  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of land held for future development and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an impaired asset  for which costs cannot be recovered from estimated undiscounted future cash flows  to be written down to fair value 
given the significance of the carrying value of land held for future development  the application of sfas no 
in evaluating any potential impairment is critical to the company s consolidated financial statements  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes on the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the liability method requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by deferred tax assets  such as tax net operating losses nols 
a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
given the significance of the company s historical federal tax nols  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the application of the company s policy in evaluating the expected future benefit of nols is critical 
in applying those policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which certain assets and liabilities are recorded 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments  and future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales the company s homebuilding operation generates revenues from the sale of homes to homebuyers 
the majority of these homes are designed to appeal to move up homebuyers and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction 
sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
revenue from the sale of homes is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer  and the earnings process is complete 
as a result  the company s revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  the company does rely on certain estimates to determine the related construction costs and resulting gross margins associated with revenues recognized 
the company s construction costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
the company s estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
warranty costs warranty reserves are established as homes close escrow on a per unit basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor to be incurred during the warranty period 
reserves are determined based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
litigation reserves the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various cases arising in the normal course of business and regarding disposed assets and businesses of the company  or former affiliates 
the company has reserved for costs expected to be incurred with respect to these cases based upon information provided by its legal counsel 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this new statement also supersedes certain aspects of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and will require expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be reported in discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as presently required by apb no 

in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
whereby an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and fair values are less than carrying values 
as required  the company adopted this new standard in january  which did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be adopted for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and  and rescission of fin no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes the adoption of such interpretation will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position and adopted the disclosure provision of such interpretation on december   as required 
additional disclosures are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the entity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company believes that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations because the company has no variable entities 
liquidity and capital resources 
the principal assets in the company s portfolio are residential land which must be held over an extended period of time in order to be developed to a condition that  in management s opinion  will ultimately maximize the return to the company 
consequently  the company requires significant capital to finance its real estate development and homebuilding operations 
historically  sources of capital have included bank lines of credit  specific property financings  asset sales and available internal funds 
the company is utilizing project debt and internally generated cash to fund construction of the second phase of the north corona project and the riverside projects  and is utilizing internally generated cash to fund the first phase of the north corona project and the bolsa chica project 
as of december   the company had internally financed approximately million of investments in homebuilding projects 
these projects are expected to generate approximately million of positive cash flows during the next months  based on present economic conditions and market assumptions 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of december  were approximately million 
the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  future real estate sales proceeds  and funds available under its credit agreements will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating and capital investment requirements  primarily project development costs for homebuilding projects and bolsa chica  along with general and administrative expenses  for the next months 
the company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land and improved homesites 
these purchase contracts typically require a cash deposit and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers  including obtaining applicable property entitlements 
the company also utilizes option contracts with third party land sellers and financial entities as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns and minimizing the use of funds from other corporate financing sources 
these option contracts also help to manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings 
option contracts generally require the payment of a non refundable cash deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at predetermined prices 
we have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial responsibility 
the company may enter into land development and homebuilding joint ventures from time to time as a means of expanding its market opportunities  establishing strategic alliances  managing its risk profile and leveraging the company s capital base 
these joint ventures may obtain secured acquisition  development and construction financing  which minimizes the use of funds from other corporate financing sources

the decrease in other income  net from million of income in to approximately

the current year amount primarily reflects million in gains on sales of short term investments  largely offset by increased period costs for land held for future development 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded income tax benefits of million and

other contractual obligations including the company s other tax liabilities  accrued benefit liability for a frozen retirement plan and other accrued pensions  home warranty reserves and contingent indemnity and environmental obligations are estimated based on various factors 
payments are not due as of a given date  but rather are dependent upon the incurrence of professional services  the lives of annuitants and other factors

land held for future development is carried at cost  with write downs to fair value only in the event that costs cannot be recovered from estimated undiscounted future cash flows  as described under impairment of long lived assets 
the estimation process involved in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates as to future events and market conditions 
such estimation process assumes the company s ability to complete development and dispose of its real estate properties in the ordinary course of business based on management s present plans and intentions 
economic  market  environmental and political conditions may affect management s development and marketing plans 
in addition  the implementation of such development and marketing plans could be affected by the availability of future financing for development and construction activities 
accordingly  the ultimate values of the company s real estate properties are dependent upon future economic and market conditions  the availability of financing  and the resolution of political  environmental and other related issues 
f the cost of sales of multi unit projects is generally computed using the relative sales value method 
interest cost is capitalized to real estate projects during their development and construction period 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of land held for future development and other long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an impaired asset  for which costs cannot be recovered from estimated undiscounted future cash flows  be written down to fair value 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as provided by sfas no 
 impairment is evaluated by comparing an asset s carrying value to the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset s operations and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
if an impairment occurs  the fair value of an asset for purposes of sfas is deemed to be the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for such asset in a current transaction 
on september   the company completed its recapitalization pursuant to court confirmation of a prepackaged plan of reorganization  and the company applied the principles required by the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code fresh start reporting and the carrying value of real estate properties was adjusted to fair value see note 
following the california coastal commission s november suggested modifications to the bolsa chica local coastal program to limit development to only the upper bench of the company s acre mesa property bolsa chica mesa see note  the company evaluated this asset s carrying value 
the company updated its analysis as of december  and since the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from the upper bench of the bolsa chica mesa and the company s additional acres at bolsa chica exceed its carrying value  there has been no impairment 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes on the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which these differences are expected to reverse 
the liability method requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales the company s homebuilding operation generates revenues from the sale of homes to homebuyers 
the majority of these homes are designed to appeal to move up homebuyers and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction 
sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
revenue from the sale of homes is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer and the earnings process is complete 
as a result  the company s revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  the company does rely on certain estimates to determine the related construction costs and f resulting gross margins associated with revenues recognized 
the company s construction costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
the company s estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
warranty costs warranty reserves are established as homes close escrow on a per unit basis in an amount estimated to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and outside labor to be incurred during the warranty period 
reserves are determined based upon historical data with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
litigation reserves the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various cases arising in the normal course of business and regarding disposed assets and businesses of the company or former affiliates 
the company has reserved for costs expected to be incurred with respect to these cases based upon information provided by its legal counsel 
earnings per common share the weighted average number of common shares outstanding was for the years ended december  and earnings per share  assuming dilution  is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding 
for the year ended december   the exercise price of outstanding stock options and warrants exceeded the average market price of the company s common stock 
for the year ended december   the average market price of the company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding stock options  but not warrants 
therefore  for the year ended december   the dilutive effect of the  common shares from potential exercise of options is reflected in the million weighted average common shares assuming dilution  in the related consolidated statement of operations

in addition  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
sfas no 
retains the requirements of sfas no 
whereby an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and fair values are less than carrying values 
as required  the company adopted this new standard in january  which did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
requires that a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be adopted for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes the adoption of such interpretation will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position and adopted the disclosure provision of such interpretation on december   as required 
additional disclosures are presented in note to these consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the entity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional f subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company believes that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations because the company has no variable entities 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
note land held for future development the company owns approximately acres located in orange county  california overlooking the pacific ocean and the bolsa chica wetlands which were sold by the company to the state of california in  surrounded by the city of huntington beach and approximately miles south of downtown los angeles 
the company s holdings include acres on a mesa north of the bolsa chica wetlands bolsa chica mesa  approximately acres on  or adjacent to  the huntington mesa and acres of lowlands which were acquired by the company in september a local coastal program lcp for development of up to  homes on the bolsa chica mesa was approved by the orange county board of supervisors in december and by the california coastal commission the coastal commission in january in october  in response to a trial court decision in connection with a lawsuit which challenged the approvals of the coastal commission the coastal act lawsuit  the coastal commission approved modifications to the lcp which eliminated the filling of warner pond and thereby reduced the maximum number of homes to be built from  to no more than  homes on the bolsa chica mesa 
the orange county board of supervisors subsequently accepted the coastal commission s suggested modifications 
in november  in response to the april court of appeal s decision in the coastal act lawsuit which prohibited relocation of a acre grove of dying eucalyptus trees which serves as raptor habitat  the coastal commission held another public hearing on the lcp and decided to limit development to only the upper bench of the bolsa chica mesa the upper mesa 
the coastal commission s november suggested modifications to the lcp would prohibit the company and other landowners from development on the approximately acre lower bench of the bolsa chica mesa the lower mesa 
in may  the county of orange declined to consider the coastal commission s november suggested modifications 
in their response to the coastal commission  the county stated that the commission s suggested modifications were infeasible and unacceptable 
in particular  the county noted that the commission s suggested modifications would remove acres of viable residentially zoned land from the county s plan 
in january  the company filed a petition for writ of mandate in orange county superior court challenging the coastal commission s november decision to substantially change the f previously approved lcp 
in february  the orange county superior court ordered that the case be reassigned to san diego superior court based on the request of the coastal commission 
the company s petition alleged that the coastal commission arbitrarily abandoned decades of prior approvals that would have permitted development on the entire bolsa chica mesa 
the petition challenged the commission s november decision as to how to protect certain raptor habitat on the bolsa chica mesa  including the commission s recommendation that the lower mesa not be developed 
the complaint also included causes of action for violation of the company s constitutional rights of equal protection and due process  and for a public taking of its private property without compensation in contravention of the us and california constitutions 
on february  the court issued a final ruling  which denied the company s petition on the grounds that the coastal commission s november decision expired by operation of law when the county rejected the coastal commission s suggested modifications 
as a result  the coastal commission s decision to prohibit development on the lower mesa is no longer of any force or effect 
the court also ruled that the company s inverse condemnation claim is premature at this time 
the company intends to continue its pursuit of reasonable development on the bolsa chica mesa 
the company is currently pursuing approval of permits for development of the upper mesa 
on may   the county of orange planning commission approved the company s site plan for development of single family homes on the upper mesa 
in response to an appeal  on july   the orange county board of supervisors upheld the planning commission s prior approval of the site plan and tentative tract map 
the planned community on the upper mesa is currently expected to offer a broad mix of home choices  ranging in size from  square feet to  square feet 
this development plan also requires approval by the coastal commission 
the company submitted a coastal development permit cdp application for this plan to the coastal commission in november the company is currently responding to comments from the coastal commission staff to have its cdp application deemed complete and currently expects the coastal commission to hold a public hearing on the cdp later this year 
the company does not believe that the coastal commission process will permanently prevent it from developing a planned community at bolsa chica  however  there can be no assurance in that regard  or as to when development could commence  or as to the number of acres or homes the company will be permitted to develop  or that further litigation or administrative delay will not result 
upon completion of the company s recapitalization as discussed in note  the company applied the principles required by fresh start reporting and the carrying value of land held for development bolsa chica was adjusted to fair value as of september   after consideration of the october coastal commission action discussed above 
the fair value was determined in using discounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset s operations and eventual disposition 
in addition  given the significance of the bolsa chica asset to the financial statements of the company  the value of the company s stock immediately following the closing of the recapitalization was used as an indicator of value of the subject property 
following the november coastal commission action  an assessment of impairment was conducted by the company for the year ended december  the company updated its analysis as of december  and  and has noted no indicators of impairment since that date 
in accordance with the company s policy described in note impairment of long lived assets and based upon the company s assessment of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  no provision for impairment has been considered necessary subsequent to the recapitalization 
f the estimation process involved in the determination of value is inherently uncertain since it requires estimates as to future events and market conditions 
such estimation process assumes the company s ability to complete development and dispose of its real estate properties in the ordinary course of business based on management s present plans and intentions 
economic  market  environmental and political conditions may affect management s development and marketing plans 
in addition  the implementation of such development and marketing plans could be affected by the availability of future financing for development and construction activities 
at such time as the company s homebuilding activities at bolsa chica commence  the company would be required to account for such property at the lower of cost or market  which may necessitate a write down of its carrying value 
accordingly  the ultimate values of the company s land held for future development are dependent upon future economic and market conditions  the availability of financing  and the resolution of political  environmental and other related issues 
the development of the company s bolsa chica mesa project is dependent upon various governmental approvals and economic factors 
accordingly  the amount ultimately realized from such project may differ materially from current estimates and the project s carrying value

in may  dresser industries  inc dresser filed litigation  captioned dresser industries  inc vs 
california coastal communities  inc 
and resco holdings  inc a former affiliate  in the th judicial district court of jefferson county  texas 
dresser seeks a declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under a january purchase agreement  whereby dresser acquired an engineering and construction business from a former parent of the company 
dresser s indemnity claims relate to several hundred contested asbestos claims made by third parties in connection with work in facilities with which the business disposed of by the former parent was allegedly connected 
the company was not formed until september and  upon being spun off in f december  indemnified its former parent for potential liabilities under the january purchase agreement with dresser to the extent that any such liabilities are not covered by insurance 
however  the company believes its indemnity for any third party asbestos claims expired in march under the terms of the january purchase agreement 
this litigation is in the early stages of discovery and the company intends to vigorously defend itself in this case and related matters 
the company also believes that it has a number of other meritorious defenses to this litigation 
thus far  no claim for monetary damages has been made in connection with this litigation and  given the preliminary nature of these proceedings  the company is not able to assess its potential exposure with any degree of accuracy 
while the company currently believes its reserves are adequate  damage awards in asbestos cases can involve amounts that would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operations or financial condition  in the event that such an award was to be rendered against the company 
in september  the company acquired acres in the bolsa chica lowlands with the intent of selling it to the state of california in connection with their planned restoration of  acres of adjacent wetlands 
while the state continues to express interest in acquiring this property  no such agreement has been reached to date and there can be no assurances that any agreement will ever be reached 
however  in  in anticipation of entering into a purchase agreement  the state performed limited soils sampling on this property and discovered contamination from a group of chemicals called pcbs 
the source of the contamination is presently unknown  however  the company has never conducted any development  business or operations on this property 
in january  the state s department of toxic substances control dtsc became the regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the company s efforts to remediate the contamination on this property 
on july  the company entered into a consent order with dtsc regarding remediation 
the company is in the process of preparing a remedial investigation workplan  and upon obtaining dtsc approval  will perform additional sampling on the property to determine the nature and extent of contamination 
the company s financial statements include a reserve of approximately 
million for environmental testing and remediation of this property 
while the reserve reflects the estimate for the minimum costs which are probable and estimable  such reserve may not be adequate to satisfy the full amount of remediation that may be required by the dtsc 
until additional soils sampling and analysis are completed later this year  the company cannot accurately estimate how much  if any  additional costs may ultimately be incurred  however  the company has been advised that costs could range up to approximately million to million in excess of the current reserve 
there is no maximum limitation to the company s obligation to remediate under the dtsc consent order 
other parties  who have yet to be identified  may be responsible for all or a portion of these remediation costs 
if any such party is subsequently identified  the company may be entitled to seek reimbursement for some or all of its costs  however  there can be no assurance in that regard 
the company provides a home warranty reserve to reflect its contingent liability for product warranty

balance at end of year note income taxes upon completion of the recapitalization  the company experienced an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code the code as a result of the increase in the percentage of the company s stock by value held by certain persons including creditors who exchanged debt for stock of more than percentage points at any time during a three year period 
subsequent to an ownership change  the company s annual use of its net operating losses nols is generally limited to the value of the company s equity immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
however  section l of the code  the bankruptcy exception  provides that if the ownership change occurs through a bankruptcy  such as the company s recapitalization which utilized a prepackaged plan  and if the continuing shareholders and qualifying creditors before the ownership change own at least of the company s stock after the ownership change  the general limitations of section will not apply 
qualifying creditors generally must have held their debt at least months before the prepackaged plan was filed on july   or the debt must have arisen in the ordinary course of the company s business 
the company believes that it qualifies for the bankruptcy exception of section l 
under this exception  the company was required to reduce its nols by i the amount of interest accrued on any debt exchanged for stock in the bankruptcy proceeding during the year of the proceeding and the three prior taxable years and ii an additional amount required to make the total reduction equal to the amount of cancelation of indebtedness income realized 
accordingly  the company s nols of approximately million as of september  were reduced by approximately million 
as reduced  the company s nol carryovers will be fully deductible against post reorganization income  subject to the general rules regarding change of ownership as discussed below  and expiration of nols 
the federal nols available as of december  are approximately million  including pre reorganization nols of approximately million  after reflecting activity subsequent to september  and the settlement with the internal revenue service irs discussed below 
the amount of nols which expire if not utilized is million  million  million and million for   and thereafter  respectively 
the company remains subject to the general rules regarding a change of ownership under section of the code  which limit the availability of nols if an ownership change occurs within any three year period 
if the company was to experience another ownership change  the use of all remaining nols would generally be subject to an annual limitation equal to the value of the company s equity before the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
the company estimates that after giving effect to various transactions by stockholders who hold a or f greater interest in the company  it has experienced a three year cumulative ownership shift of approximately  as computed in accordance with section in response to an unsolicited written consent from a majority of its stockholders  the company amended its certificate of incorporation on october  in order to preserve the ability of the company to utilize its tax loss carryforwards 
since the company s use of its nols would be severely restricted if it experiences an ownership change of or more  the company s majority stockholders requested that the board of directors enact the amendments  which have been determined to be in the best interest of the company and its stockholders 
the amendments prohibit future purchases of the company s common stock by persons who would become new holders  and also prohibit current holders of over from increasing their positions  except in certain permissible circumstances which would not jeopardize the company s ability to use its nols 
while these amendments reduced the company s risk of an ownership change occurring due to the acquisition of shares by stockholders  the risk remains that an ownership change could result from the sale of shares by existing stockholders 
the tax effects of items that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax accounts for the years ended december in millions are as follows deferred tax assets accruals reserves not deductible until paid net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards state income tax provisions deductible when paid for federal tax purposes valuation allowance deferred tax liabilities land held for future development principally due to accounting for a prior business combination  partially offset by asset revaluations in and unrealized gain on securities net deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax liabilities at december  and are primarily comprised of state net deferred tax liabilities and are included in other liabilities 
the company has established a valuation allowance related to the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets due to uncertainties that preclude it from determining that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize such assets 
such uncertainties include the availability of real estate for development at economically viable prices  government approvals  results of litigation and economic factors affecting the company s operations 
the company monitors these  as well as other positive and negative factors that may arise in the future  as it assesses the need for a valuation allowance against its f deferred tax assets 
recognition of tax benefits from future potential reductions in valuation allowances attributable to any utilization of pre reorganization nols would be excluded from results of operations and credited to capital in excess of par value 
the portion of the valuation allowance allocated to federal pre reorganization nols is approximately million as of december  the following is a summary of the income tax provision benefit applicable to income before income taxes for the years ended december in millions current taxes

tax compliance matters in  the irs proposed material audit adjustments with respect to the tax returns of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries  including formerly affiliated entities  for the years ended december   and the adjustments proposed by the irs  could have resulted in federal tax liability  before interest  of approximately million and disallowance of up to million of nol carryforwards 
the company disagreed with the positions taken by the irs and filed protests with the irs to contest the proposed adjustments 
in december  the company executed a settlement agreement with the irs with respect to the proposed adjustments described above 
as a result of this agreement  in february  the company paid  net of the company s refund claim for nol carrybacks of approximately million  in full settlement of such claims 
under this settlement agreement  approximately million of the company s nol carryforwards were disallowed 
the company utilized million of nol carryback from to in connection with its refund claim 
in june  the company received a refund of  for an overpayment of interest  indicating acceptance by the irs of the refund claim 
accordingly  pursuant to fresh start f reporting  the company recorded utilization of approximately million of pre reorganization nol in  resulting in an equivalent amount credited to capital in excess of par value 
the company periodically reviews the potential for state tax liability adjustments related to the irs tax settlement for  and and does not believe that any such adjustments would have a negative material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
nearly all of the state jurisdictions in which the company filed amended returns for these years have accepted such returns  thereby significantly reducing the company s exposure to potential claims 
in conjunction with periodic reviews of the adequacy of reserves for estimated state income tax exposure  the company reduced its reserves by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the reduction in contingent liabilities is reflected as a benefit in the income tax provision

there is generally no maximum obligation or amount of indemnity provided for such liabilities 
a portion of such liabilities is supported by insurance or by indemnities from certain of the company s previously affiliated companies 
the company believes its consolidated balance sheet reflects adequate reserves for these matters

while these amendments reduced the company s risk of an ownership change occurring due to the acquisition of shares by stockholders  the risk remains that an ownership change could result from the sale of shares by existing stockholders
