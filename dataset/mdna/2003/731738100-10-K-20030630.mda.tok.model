for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below in the section titled factors affecting future operating results in this annual report on form k

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
polymedica s significant accounting policies are presented within note b to our consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all of our accounting policies impact the consolidated financial statements  certain policies may be viewed to be critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management believes the policies that fall within this category are the policies on revenue recognition and sales allowances  accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  advertising  accruals for medicare adjustments  and uncertainties 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue related to product sales to customers who have placed orders  upon shipment  provided that risk of loss has passed to the customer and we have received and verified the required written forms  if applicable  to bill medicare  other third party payers  and customers 
we record revenue at the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payers  and directly from customers 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including a review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  historical experience  and the credit worthiness of customers 
the determination of appropriate medicare rates for billing and revenue recognition is complex and sometimes subjective and therefore may require management s interpretation 
sales allowances are recorded for estimated product returns as a reduction of revenue 
we analyze sales allowances using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume  customer demographics  and business conditions 
these allowances are adjusted to reflect actual returns 
changes in these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the valuation of accounts receivable is based upon the credit worthiness of customers and third party payers as well as our historical collection experience 
allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense for estimated amounts expected to be uncollectible from third party payers and customers 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  and on our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category 
changes in judgment regarding these factors could affect the timing and amount of costs recognized 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
market value or the net realizable value to polymedica is impacted by the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  and pricing 
due to the medical nature of the products we provide  customers sometimes request supplies before we have received the required written forms  if applicable  to bill medicare  other third party payers  and customers 
as a result  included in inventories are items shipped to customers for which we have received an order but have not yet received the required written documents and therefore have not recognized revenue 
the carrying value of inventory shipped to customers of million and million as of march  and  respectively  is based upon historical experience of collection of documents required to bill medicare  other third party payers  and customers 
changes in judgment regarding the recoverability of inventories  including the carrying value of inventory shipped to customers  could result in the recording of additional income or expense 
goodwill subsequent to the transitional impairment test  as prescribed under sfas no 
 we are required to perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
step one of the impairment test is performed to determine whether an impairment exists  step two of the impairment test is performed to 
table of contents determine the amount of the charge to be recorded as a result of the impairment 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements 
in performing impairment tests  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions relating to the allocation of certain assets and liabilities to our reporting units  estimates of the fair values of our reporting units  and the related fair value of certain of their assets and liabilities 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used could affect the determination of whether an impairment exists as well as the quantification of the impairment value  should one exist 
advertising in accordance with statement of position sop we capitalize and amortize direct response advertising and related costs when we can demonstrate that customers have directly responded to our advertisements  among other things 
we assess the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising costs reported as assets at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets to the probable remaining future net cash flows expected to result directly from such advertising 
management s judgments include determining the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized  currently four years for our diabetes supplies and two years for our respiratory supplies 
a business change  including a change in reimbursement rates  that reduces expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
for recent developments regarding the application of sop  please see note u to the consolidated financial statements 
non direct response advertising  promotional and marketing costs are charged to earnings in the period in which they are incurred 
accruals for medicare adjustments the government s medicare regulations are complex and sometimes subjective and therefore may require management s interpretation 
accruals for medicare adjustments occur in the normal course of business and are recorded when  based upon our assessment of the facts and circumstance  we believe that the amounts due are probable and estimable 
uncertainties our compliance with medicare regulations may be reviewed by federal or state agencies  including the department of health and human services  the doj  and the fda 
the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  is investigating allegations of healthcare fraud  improper revenue recognition and obstruction of justice by liberty and liberty home pharmacy 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating with the investigations 
since july  we have spent approximately million on legal and accounting fees primarily preparing for and responding to the investigations and the two lawsuits described below 
this work has been conducted under the direction of legal counsel who report to the oversight committee  a special board committee comprised of three outside directors  which was established to oversee our response to the investigations and the related litigation 
in june  liberty was served with an administrative subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of illinois seeking documents relevant to an ongoing investigation of medicare reimbursement of depth shoes and inserts 
liberty has been informed that it is not a target of that investigation 
liberty completed its response to the subpoena in november polymedica and three individuals who are or were officers of polymedica are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
in addition  there is a derivative action against certain directors and two individuals who are or were officers in massachusetts state court alleging certain breaches of fiduciary duty 
polymedica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims made against it in the actions in which it is a defendant and intends to contest the claims vigorously 
although we do not consider an unfavorable outcome to the various claims probable  we cannot accurately predict their ultimate disposition  and have therefore not recorded any charges related to their outcome 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
please see item of part i  legal proceedings  for a more complete description of these claims 
if any of the investigations or legal proceedings referred to above results in a determination that we have failed to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting or have otherwise committed healthcare fraud or securities law violations  we could be subject to delays or loss of reimbursement  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions 
although we do not consider an unfavorable outcome to the various claims probable  we cannot accurately predict their ultimate disposition  and have therefore not recorded any charges related to their outcome 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to those described above  we have certain contingent liabilities  including but not limited to  litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents recent transactions on february   we repurchased  shares of common stock for million or an average price of per share 
of the  shares originally authorized by the board   shares remained authorized for repurchase as of march  on february   we paid a per share cash dividend on  common shares outstanding for a total payment of million to our common shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  the current intention of our board is to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
on january   we purchased a  square foot building located in port st 
lucie  florida for a purchase price  excluding legal fees and associated acquisition costs  of million  for the purpose of supporting the growth in our florida businesses 
we commenced renovation of the facility in february other advertising rates may fluctuate during the year  which may affect our acquisition of new customers 
we may purchase less advertising when rates are higher  which generally occurs in november and december 
as a result  our acquisition of new customers during this period is generally reduced and our net revenues may fluctuate accordingly 
we operate from manufacturing and distribution facilities located in massachusetts and florida  respectively 
virtually all of our product sales are denominated in us dollars 
expense items include cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
cost of sales consists primarily of purchased finished goods for sale in our markets and  to a lesser extent  materials  direct labor  and overhead costs for products that we manufacture in our facility and shipping and handling fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures for personnel and benefits  as well as legal and related expenses  allowances for bad debts  rent  amortization of capitalized direct response advertising costs and other amortization and depreciation 
period to period comparisons of changes in net revenues are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  the following table presents consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues net revenues liberty diabetes liberty respiratory pharmaceuticals total net revenues cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations 
table of contents total net revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of the growth in revenues from our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments which increased and  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  net revenues in the liberty diabetes segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this growth was due primarily to the growth in our customer base  which grew to approximately  active customers as of march   from approximately  as of march   primarily as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
fluctuations in the order volume  order frequency and mix of product for new and existing customers  including those with type ii diabetes  also contributed to the change in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal net revenues from our liberty respiratory segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was due primarily to the growth in our customer base  which grew to approximately  active customers as of march   from approximately  as of march   as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
fluctuations in the order volume  order frequency and mix of product for new and existing customers also contributed to the change in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal net revenues from our pharmaceuticals segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the growth in liberty pharmacy sales of prescription oral medications not covered by medicare 
sales of these products represented and of total pharmaceuticals segment net revenues in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we expect this trend of increasing sales from liberty pharmacy to continue 
the current customer base for these products consists primarily of existing liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory customers  and their spouses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  overall gross margins were in the fiscal year ended march  and in the fiscal year ended march  gross margins in the fiscal year ended march  decreased primarily as a result of the increase in net revenues generated from lower margin prescription oral medication sales 
liberty pharmacy  although profitable  has significantly lower gross and operating margins than our historical businesses 
as a result  future consolidated earnings growth is projected to be less than future consolidated revenue growth 
as a percentage of total net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with in the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in the fiscal year ended march  to million  as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues was primarily attributable to an additional million of selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended march  in the liberty respiratory segment related to the establishment of a reserve for medicare overpayments  coupled with a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fiscal year ended march  in the liberty respiratory segment related to a reduction in this reserve based upon a favorable determination by one of the four medicare carriers that our original method of billing for albuterol and ipratropium combinations was proper 
other factors that contributed to the change in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues included approximately million more of consolidated legal and related expenses  million for termination of employment charges related to the termination of certain executive officers  and million more of direct response advertising amortization in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  these increases were offset by million of goodwill amortization recorded in the fiscal year ended march   that was not recorded in the fiscal year ended march  investment income decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due to a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with  in the fiscal year ended march  the provision for income taxes was million and million in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  which resulted in an effective tax rate of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in fiscal years and were higher than the federal us statutory rates due primarily to state taxes and other permanent differences 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for fiscal year will be at or near the fiscal effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to federal or state tax 
table of contents laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  or local income tax rates  and the deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  the following table presents consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues net revenues liberty diabetes liberty respiratory pharmaceuticals total net revenues cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations total net revenues increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily the result of the growth in revenues from our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments which increased and  respectively  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march  net revenues in the liberty diabetes segment increased by to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this growth was due primarily to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
revenue growth was aided by a cost of living adjustment implemented by the government for certain durable medical equipment products  including diabetes test strips  under the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of  which added to the revenue of many of our liberty diabetes segment products beginning july  in addition  due to the late implementation by the government of the january  cost of living adjustment  which went into effect july   an incremental cost of living adjustment was recorded from july  to december  this incremental cost of living adjustment ended on december  net revenues from our liberty respiratory segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was due primarily to the growth in our customer base as a result of our direct response advertising spending 
net revenues from our pharmaceuticals segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the launch of liberty s non medicare operation  liberty pharmacy 
liberty pharmacy sales represented of pharmaceutical segment net revenues in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net revenues generated from liberty pharmacy was offset by a reduction in net revenues due to the sale of certain assets of our thermometry business in september as a percentage of total net revenues  overall gross margins were in the fiscal year ended march  and in the fiscal year ended march  gross margins in the fiscal year ended march  increased slightly due primarily to a cost of living adjustment described above  and increased sales in our higher margin liberty respiratory segment  partially offset by a change 
table of contents in the interpretation of the reimbursement formula for albuterol and ipratropium combinations see note g to the consolidated financial statements for more details  increasing sales from new business initiatives that have lower margins than our average and a change in the product mix for our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments

selling  general and administrative expenses further increased due to an increase in direct response advertising amortization of million to million in the fiscal year ended march   from million in the fiscal year ended march  amortization increased as a result of the growth in the direct response advertising asset value 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
investment income decreased to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   due to a lower average cash balance and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased to  in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with  in the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to the elimination of interest expense on liberty s port st 
lucie facility mortgage as a result of the million repayment in december the provision for income taxes was million and million in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  which resulted in an effective tax rate of and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in fiscal years and were higher than the federal us statutory rates due primarily to state taxes and other permanent differences 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to federal or state tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  or local income tax rates  and the deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
liquidity and capital resources our business and its sustained growth is currently funded through cash flow from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased  to million as of march   due primarily to cash flows generated from operations less cash outflows such as the purchase of property  plant and equipment and investments  the repurchase of our common stock and the payment of cash dividends 
cash flows from operations of million for the fiscal year ended march   were generated by income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  offset by cash used to fund certain areas of our operations  including an increase in spending for direct response advertising of million to million in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with million in the fiscal year ended march   to further expand our customer base 
an increase in our net accounts receivable balance of million to million as of march   as compared with million as of march   also offset cash flows generated by income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

table of contents in the fiscal years ended march  and  we used million and million of cash for investing activities  respectively 
the million increase in total cash used for investing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to the purchase of million of investments and a million increase in property  plant and equipment purchases related to the construction of two new facilities and the purchase of a building in port st 
lucie  florida 
in the fiscal years ended march  and  we used million and million of cash for financing activities  respectively 
the million decrease in total cash used for financing activities in the fiscal year ended march   as compared with the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to fewer share repurchases 
in the fiscal year ended march   we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average repurchase price of per share  as compared with million used to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average repurchase price of per share in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was offset primarily by million of cash dividends paid to shareholders of record as of february   in the fiscal year ended march  the current intention of our board is to pay a cash dividend to shareholders of record on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
we expect the quarterly cash dividend payment to average approximately million 
as of march    shares remained authorized for repurchase under the august authorized share repurchase program 
other financing activities included the payment of capital lease and note payable obligations  amounts set aside for executive deferred compensation plans and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance as of march  of million  and cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet working capital  capital expenditure and financing needs  including the payment of dividends to shareholders  for future business operations for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we undertake to make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may require substantial additional funding beyond currently available working capital and funds generated from operations 
other factors which could negatively affect our liquidity include a reduction in the demand for our products  an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and investigations  or a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products 
we have various contractual obligations that affect our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations for future annual minimum lease  note payable and rental commitments as of march   under all of our leases  capital and operating and our note payable capital operating note in thousands leases leases payable and thereafter total minimum payments advertising we have committed to purchasing approximately and million in the fiscal years ending march  and  respectively  in advertising spots from various television networks 
we entered into these purchase commitments to obtain favorable advertising rates to more efficiently acquire new customers

a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
additionally  companies with significant investments in variable interest entities  even if not required to consolidate the variable interest entity  have enhanced disclosure requirements

factors affecting future operating results all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our future operating results remain difficult to predict 
we continue to face many risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results  including without limitation  those described below 
we could experience significantly reduced profits if medicare changes  delays or denies reimbursement sales of a significant portion of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory medications and supplies depend on the continued availability of reimbursement of our customers by government and private insurance plans 
any reduction in medicare reimbursement currently available for our products would reduce our revenues 
without a corresponding reduction in the cost of such 
table of contents products  the result would be a reduction in our overall profit margin 
similarly  any increase in the cost of such products would reduce our overall profit margin unless there was a corresponding increase in medicare reimbursement 
our profits could also be affected by the imposition of more stringent regulatory requirements for medicare reimbursement or adjustments to previously reimbursed amounts 
federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us as they relate to billing requirements and reimbursement levels of our products 
legislation and regulations are pending relating to medicare reform proposals the united states house of representatives house and senate senate are considering medicare reform and coverage of outpatient prescription drug legislation that include proposals to freeze durable medical equipment dme payments through  reduce payments for covered outpatient drugs to percent of the average wholesale price awp of such drugs  require certain dme to be competitively bid  and implement a competitive acquisition program for outpatient drugs and biologics 
if this legislation is enacted  it will likely include one or more of these changes 
if enacted  these proposals could apply to us 
if competitive bidding for dme is enacted  we would begin the process of understanding the bidding requirements and working with the appropriate officials in preparing bids for products that are covered 
the other proposals could result in payment reductions for certain products 
this legislation is also likely to authorize certain regulatory relief in the administrative process of the medicare claims and payment rules 
it is uncertain at this time whether such legislation will be enacted and become law 
inherent reasonableness final regulations have been implemented by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms that develop a process for identifying whether a payment may be reduced or increased for a category of items or services if it is determined that such payment is grossly deficient or excessive 
the process set forth in these regulations could affect the payment for the items that we provide 
litigation may materially adversely affect us polymedica and three individuals who are or were officers of polymedica are defendants in a lawsuit alleging violations of certain sections and rules of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
in addition  there is a derivative action against certain directors and two individuals who are or were officers in massachusetts state court alleging certain breaches of fiduciary duty 
polymedica believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims made against it in the actions in which it is a defendant and intends to contest the claims vigorously 
although we do not consider an unfavorable outcome to the various claims probable  we cannot accurately predict their ultimate disposition  and have therefore not recorded any charges related to their outcome 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
please see item of part i  legal proceedings  for a more complete description of these claims 
we could experience significantly reduced profits as the result of an unfavorable outcome to current governmental investigations the regulations that govern medicare reimbursement are complex and our compliance with those regulations may be reviewed by federal agencies  including the department of health and human services  the doj  and the fda 
the us attorney s office for the southern district of florida  with the assistance of the fbi and oig  is investigating allegations of healthcare fraud  improper revenue recognition and obstruction of justice by liberty and liberty home pharmacy 
both civil and criminal investigations are being conducted 
we are cooperating with the investigations 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings at this time  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to their outcome 
if any of these investigations results in a determination that we have failed to comply with the regulations governing medicare reimbursement or financial reporting or have otherwise committed healthcare fraud or securities law violations  we could be subject to delays or loss of reimbursement  substantial fines or penalties  and other sanctions 
an adverse determination could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of these proceedings  and have therefore not recorded any charges relating to their outcome 
in june  liberty was served with an administrative subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of illinois seeking documents relevant to an ongoing investigation of medicare reimbursement of depth shoes and inserts 
liberty has been informed that it is not a target of that investigation 
liberty completed its response to the subpoena in november 
table of contents geopolitical events may reduce our ability to obtain favorable advertising rates for our direct response advertising efforts  which may adversely affect our operating results the effectiveness of our direct response advertising is subject to the risks arising from geopolitical events 
for example  around the clock news coverage on the war in iraq and the war on terrorism affected our ability to obtain favorable rates for our product advertisements and thus affected our ability to obtain new customers 
such geopolitical events may continue in the foreseeable future and may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
shortening or eliminating amortization of our direct response advertising costs could adversely affect our operating results any change in existing accounting rules or a business change that impacts expected net cash flows or that shortens the period over which such net cash flows are estimated to be realized  currently four years for our diabetes products and two years for our respiratory supplies  could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
for recent developments regarding the accounting treatment of our advertising costs  please see note u to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  new or different marketing initiatives that may not qualify for direct response advertising could result in accelerated charges against our earnings 
our stock price could be volatile the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for healthcare related companies in particular  has experienced extreme volatility 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased the stock 
prices for the common stock will be determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors  including variations in our financial results  changes in earnings estimates by industry research analysts  investors perceptions of us and general economic  industry and market conditions 
we plan to continue our rapid expansion  if we do not manage our growth successfully  our growth and profitability may slow or stop we have expanded our operations rapidly and plan to continue to expand 
this expansion has created significant demand on our administrative  operational and financial personnel and other resources 
additional expansion in existing or new markets could strain these resources and increase our need for capital 
our personnel  systems  procedures  controls and existing space may not be adequate to support further expansion 
the profitability of our liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory segments will decrease if we do not receive recurring orders from customers we generally incur losses and negative cash flow with respect to the first order from a new customer for liberty diabetes and liberty respiratory supplies  due primarily to the marketing and regulatory compliance costs associated with initial customer qualification
