acquired in process research and development in the third quarter of  the company incurred a one time expense of billion associated with writing off the acquired in process research and development ipr d related to the immunex acquisition 
the amount expensed as ipr d represents an estimate of the fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
these cash flows were then discounted to a present value using discount rates ranging from to 
in addition  solely for the 
table of contents purposes of estimating the fair values of these ipr d projects as of july   the following assumptions were made future r d costs of million to million per therapeutic area would be incurred to complete the inflammation and the oncology research projects  and future costs of million to million would be incurred to complete all other research projects 
these estimates are net of any r d costs that will be shared under collaborations with corporate partners 
the research projects  which were in various stages of development from pre clinical through phase clinical trials  are expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from through the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
amortization of intangible assets in  amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired in connection with the immunex acquisition was million 
amortization of intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years on a straight line basis 
other items  net in  other items  net consisted of three items a one time  non recurring benefit of million related to the recovery of certain expenses accrued in the fourth quarter of related to terminating collaboration agreements with various third parties  a legal award associated with the product license arbitration with johnson johnson of million  and a charitable contribution to the amgen foundation of million

in  other items  net consisted of two items a legal award associated with the spillover arbitration with johnson johnson of million  and a charitable contribution to the amgen foundation of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the   and items 
interest and other income  net in  interest and other income  net decreased million or over the prior year 
this decrease was principally due to higher realized losses related to equity securities and higher losses on foreign currency transactions 
the decrease was partially offset by higher interest income generated from the company s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances 
higher average cash balances during offset the impact of lower average interest rates 
in  interest and other income  net increased million or over the prior year 
this increase was due to higher interest income generated from the company s investment portfolio as a result of higher average cash balances  partially offset by lower interest rates in and higher gains on the sale of equity investments that occurred in 
table of contents income taxes the company s effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
the company s negative effective tax rate for was primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of ipr d costs in connection with the immunex acquisition which is not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of the ipr d write off  the effective tax rate would have been 
this effective tax rate was lower than the effective tax rate of primarily due to the puerto rico restructuring described below 
during  the company restructured its puerto rico manufacturing operations using a controlled foreign corporation 
as permitted in apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company does not provide us income taxes on the controlled foreign corporation s undistributed earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 
therefore  the company s effective tax rate for reflected the permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings outside the united states 
in addition  the puerto rico manufacturing operations were entitled to a possession tax credit for a portion of this credit is capped based on the income level and expires in the higher effective tax rate in versus was a result of increased taxable income combined with the cap on the possession tax credit 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
epogen revenue recognition the company has the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics  and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
amgen has granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
pursuant to this license  the company and johnson johnson are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover 
accordingly  amgen does not recognize product sales it makes into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and does recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into amgen s exclusive market 
sales in amgen s exclusive market are derived from the company s sales to its customers  as adjusted for spillover 
the company is employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover 
the company initially recognizes spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjusts such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material 
immunex purchase price allocation the purchase price for immunex was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
an independent third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of in process research and development  identifiable intangible assets  and certain property  plant  and equipment 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete 
table of contents the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
the company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
additionally  estimates for the purchase price allocation may change as subsequent information becomes available 
deferred income taxes the company s effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in international operations based on the company s projected cash flow  working capital  and long term investment requirements of its us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact the company s effective future tax rate 
financial outlook liquidity and capital resources the company currently estimates spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately billion to billion in  which reflects higher spending on capital projects including the puerto rico manufacturing expansion  the seattle inflammation research headquarters  and the new rhode island manufacturing plant  which will be adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility 
results of operations in the future  the company expects growth of its businesses to be driven by new products  primarily neulasta  enbrel  and aranesp see forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen 
epogen epogen is approved in the united states for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
the company believes epogen sales growth will come primarily from patient population growth and price increases 
patients receiving treatment for end stage renal disease are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
the company believes future epogen sales growth may also be affected by future changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government 
epogen may compete with aranesp in the united states as health care providers may use aranesp to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of epogen 
aranesp in  aranesp was approved in the united states  most countries in europe  australia  and new zealand for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure  including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis 
in july  aranesp was approved in the united states for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in patients with non myeloid malignancies 
in august  aranesp was approved in europe for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy 
the company has launched aranesp in several european countries and will expand into other countries as reimbursement is finalized 
the company believes future aranesp sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as the effects of competitive pressures  penetration of existing and new market opportunities  and changes in foreign 
table of contents currency exchange rates 
in addition  future worldwide aranesp sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  as well as the availability of reimbursement by third party payors  including governments and private insurance plans 
for example  effective january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for aranesp for medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting 
while we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information  we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule  or if such reimbursement changes for aranesp in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings  by other payors  or for our other products 
the hospital outpatient medicare setting accounted for approximately of our us revenues of aranesp for the year ended december  us sales of aranesp for the year ended december  were million 
neupogen neulasta in january  neulasta was approved in the united states to decrease the incidence of infection  as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with non myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti cancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia 
the company launched neulasta in the united states in april in august  neulasta was approved in europe for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy 
in january  the company commenced launching neulasta in europe on a country by country basis as reimbursement has been established 
neupogen is approved in the united states to decrease the incidence of infection  as manifested by febrile neutropenia  in chemotherapy patients with non myeloid malignancies the same use for which neulasta is approved  to reduce the duration of neutropenia for patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation  to reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia related consequences in patients with severe chronic neutropenia  for use in mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for stem cell transplantation  and to reduce the recovery time of neutrophils and the duration of fever following chemotherapy treatment in patients being treated for acute myelogenous leukemia 
neupogen is approved in europe  canada  and australia for these same indications as well as for the treatment of neutropenia in hiv patients receiving antiviral and or other myelosuppressive medications 
the company believes future neupogen and neulasta sales growth will depend on penetration of existing markets  the conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta  patient population growth  price increases  the effects of competitive products or therapies  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  future worldwide sales growth may be affected by cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  as well as the availability of reimbursement by third party payors  including governments and private insurance plans 
further  chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less neupogen neulasta 
neupogen competes with neulasta in the united states and europe 
the company believes that us neupogen sales have and will continue to be adversely impacted by the launch of neulasta  however the company cannot accurately predict the extent to which healthcare providers will use neulasta instead of neupogen or the timing of this conversion 
enbrel as a result of the immunex acquisition in july  the company acquired the rights to enbrel in the united states and canada 
enbrel is approved in the united states for the reduction of the signs and symptoms in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis ra  treating moderately to severely active polyarticular course juvenile ra in patients who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease modifying antirheumatic drugs  inhibiting the progression of structural damage in patients with moderately to severely active ra  and for reducing the signs and symptoms of active arthritis in patients with 
table of contents psoriatic arthritis 
the company believes that future sales of enbrel will depend on limits on the current supply of and sources of enbrel  penetration of existing and new market opportunities  the availability and extent of reimbursement by third party payors  the effects of competing products or therapies  and any potential adverse developments discovered with respect to enbrel s safety 
enbrel is currently marketed in the united states and canada under a co promotion agreement with wyeth and  accordingly  wyeth receives a share of the profits from sales of enbrel 
in late december  the fda approved the manufacturing facility and the related third party fill and finish facilities 
because of these plant approvals  additional supply of enbrel is available to patients 
trends expected to impact future operations future operating results of the company may be impacted by a number of factors 
the following trends in our business are expected to impact our future liquidity and results of operations combined neupogen and neulasta sales are expected to increase  however  us neupogen sales are expected to continue to decrease due to conversion of patients to neulasta cost of sales as a percentage of product sales is expected to continue to increase due to higher manufacturing and royalty expense for enbrel sg a expenses are expected to continue to be impacted by seasonal trends in the fourth quarter that increase expenses over the three prior quarters non cash amortization expense of acquired identifiable intangible assets  principally related to enbrel  will be approximately million  pre tax  on an annual basis forward looking statements and factors that may affect amgen this report and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about us  our future performance  our business or others on our behalf  our beliefs and our management s assumptions 
in addition  we  or others on our behalf  may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements  or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings  webcasts  phone calls  and conference calls

these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
we have based our forward looking statements on our management s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made 
we caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed  implied  or forecast by our forward looking statements 
reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales  expenses  earnings per share  liquidity and capital resources  and trends 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions  or otherwise 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome of the forward looking statements 
our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payors  and a reduction in the payment rate or reimbursement could result in decreased use or sales of our products 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our products are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments  under programs such as medicare 
table of contents and medicaid in the united states  and private insurance plans 
medicare does not cover prescriptions for enbrel 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that could limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
in addition  we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our products  which may adversely impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic product is approved  the availability of governmental and or private reimbursement for that product is uncertain  as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed 
we cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for our recently approved products or product candidates  including those at a late stage of development  and current reimbursement policies for marketed products may change at any time  we believe that sales of aranesp and neulasta are and will be affected by government and private payor reimbursement policies 
effective january   cms instituted certain changes to its payment system that included a rule setting a significantly reduced reimbursement rate for aranesp for medicare patients in the hospital outpatient setting 
while we believe that this new rule is based on inaccurate information  we cannot predict whether we will be successful in correcting inaccuracies underlying this rule  or if such reimbursement changes for aranesp in this setting may impact reimbursement in other settings  by other payors or for our other products 
if reimbursement for our marketed products changes adversely or if we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement for our other current or future products  health care providers may limit how much or under what circumstances they will administer them  which could reduce the use of our products or cause us to reduce the price of our products 
this could result in lower product sales or revenues which could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
for example  in the united states the use of epogen in connection with treatment for end stage renal disease is funded primarily by the us federal government 
in early  cms instituted a reimbursement change for epogen which materially and adversely affected our epogen sales until the policies were revised 
our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
we conduct research  preclinical testing  and clinical trials and we manufacture and contract manufacture our product candidates 
we also manufacture and contract manufacture  price  sell  distribute  and market or co market our products for their approved indications 
these activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the united states  such as the fda and cms  as well as in foreign countries  including europe 
currently  we are required in the united states and in foreign countries to obtain approval from those countries regulatory authorities before we can market and sell our products in those countries 
in our experience  obtaining regulatory approval is costly and takes many years  and after it is obtained  it remains costly to maintain 
the fda and other us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  require changes in labeling of our products and mandate product withdrawals 
all of our marketed products are currently approved in the united states and most are approved in europe and in other foreign countries for specific uses 
we currently manufacture and market all our approved products  and we plan to manufacture and market many of our potential products 
even though we have obtained regulatory approval for our marketed products  these products and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
in addition  enbrel is manufactured both by us at our rhode island manufacturing facility and by a third party contract manufacturer  bi pharma  and fill and finish of bulk product produced at our rhode island manufacturing facility is done by third party service providers 
bi pharma and these third party service providers are subject to fda regulatory authority 
see our sources of supply for enbrel are limited 
in addition  later discovery of unknown problems with our products or manufacturing processes or those of our contract manufacturers or third party service providers could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
if regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers have 
table of contents violated regulations or if they restrict  suspend  or revoke our prior approvals  they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling our marketed products until we or our contract manufacturers or third party service providers comply or indefinitely 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate  then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it 
if we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if our intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or if we fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation  our business could be adversely affected 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal  scientific  and factual questions 
to date  there has emerged no consistent policy regarding breadth of claims allowed in such companies patents 
third parties may challenge  invalidate  or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products  product candidates  and technologies 
in addition  our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents 
for certain of our product candidates  there are third parties who have patents or pending patents that they may claim prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories 
patent disputes are frequent  costly and can preclude commercialization of products 
we are currently  and in the future may be  involved in patent litigation 
for example  we are involved in ongoing patent infringement lawsuits against transkaryotic therapies  inc tkt and aventis with respect to our erythropoietin patents 
if we ultimately lose these or other litigations we could be subject to competition and or significant liabilities  we could be required to enter into third party licenses for the infringed product or technology  or we could be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates 
we have filed applications for a number of patents and have been granted patents or obtained rights relating to erythropoietin  recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  pegfilgrastim  etanercept  and our other products and potential products 
we market our erythropoietin  recombinant g csf  darbepoetin alfa  pegfilgrastim  and etanercept products as epogen  neupogen  aranesp  neulasta  and enbrel  respectively 
in the united states  we have been issued or obtained rights to several patents relating to erythropoietin that generally cover dna and host cells  processes for making erythropoietin  various product claims to erythropoietin  cells that make levels of erythropoietin  and pharmaceutical compositions of erythropoietin 
we have also been issued or obtained rights to us patents relating to g csf that cover aspects of dna  vectors  cells  processes  polypeptides  methods of treatment using g csf polypeptides  methods of enhancing bone marrow transplantation and treating burn wounds  methods for recombinant production of g csf  and analogs of g csf 
we have been issued or obtained rights to us and european patents pertaining to pegfilgrastim pegylated g csf 
we also have been granted or obtained rights to a patent in europe relating to erythropoietin  a patent in europe relating to g csf  two patents in europe relating to darbepoetin alfa and hyperglycosylated erythropoietic proteins  and a patent in the united states and a patent in europe relating to anakinra 
we have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in the united states that generally cover dna issued in and  products issued in and  and processes for using issued 
these patents have varying expiration dates  with the latest united states etanercept related patent expiring in we have been granted or have obtained rights to patents relating to etanercept in europe 
the latest european patent relating to etanercept expires in limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales 
us and canadian supply of enbrel is impacted by many manufacturing and production variables  such as the timing and actual number of production runs  production success rate  bulk drug yield  and the timing and outcome of product quality testing 
for example  in the second quarter of  immunex corporation  the prior 
table of contents owner of enbrel  experienced a brief period where no enbrel was available to fill patient prescriptions  primarily due to variation in the expected production yield from bi pharma 
once supply of enbrel became available  immunex resumed filling orders on a first come  first served basis 
if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of enbrel to patients  we may lose patients  physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of enbrel  our enbrel sales will be adversely affected  any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
see we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel 
and our sources of supply for enbrel are limited 
we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel 
we currently manufacture enbrel at our rhode island manufacturing facility 
however  we also depend on third parties for a significant portion of our enbrel supply as well as for the fill and finish of enbrel that we manufacture 
bi pharma is currently our sole third party supplier of enbrel  accordingly  our us and canadian supply of enbrel is currently significantly dependent on bi pharma s production schedule for enbrel 
we would be unable to produce enbrel in sufficient quantities to substantially offset shortages in bi pharma s scheduled production if bi pharma or other third party manufacturers used for enbrel production were to cease or interrupt production or services or otherwise fail to supply materials  products  or services to us for any reason  including due to labor shortages or disputes  due to regulatory requirements or action  or due to contamination of product lots or product recalls 
this in turn could materially reduce our ability to satisfy demand for enbrel  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
factors that will affect our actual supply of enbrel at any time include  without limitation  the following bi pharma does not produce enbrel continuously  rather  it produces the drug through a series of periodic campaigns throughout the year 
the amount of commercial inventory available to us at any time depends on a variety of factors  including the timing and actual number of bi pharma s production runs  level of production yields and success rates  timing and outcome of product quality testing  and the amount of vialing capacity 
bi pharma schedules the vialing production runs for enbrel in advance  based on the expected timing and yield of bulk drug production runs 
therefore  if bi pharma realizes production yields beyond expected levels  or provides additional manufacturing capacity of enbrel  it may not have sufficient vialing capacity for all of the enbrel bulk drug that it produces 
as a result  even if we are able to increase our supply of enbrel bulk drug  bi pharma may not be able to fill and finish the extra bulk drug in time to prevent any supply interruptions 
in addition  we are dependent on third parties for fill and finish of enbrel bulk drug manufactured at our rhode island facility 
if third party fill and finish service providers are unable to provide sufficient capacity or otherwise unable to provide services to us  then supply of enbrel could be adversely affected 
see limits on supply for enbrel may constrain enbrel sales  and our sources of supply for enbrel are limited 
our sources of supply for enbrel are limited 
enbrel supply for the united states and canada is produced by us at our rhode island facility and by bi pharma  currently our sole source third party supplier 
see we are dependent on third parties for a significant portion of our supply and the fill and finish of enbrel 
in addition  our current plan includes construction of a new large scale cell culture commercial manufacturing facility at the site of the current rhode island manufacturing facility 
we have entered into a manufacturing agreement with genentech  inc genentech to produce enbrel at genentech s manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california 
the manufacturing facility is subject to fda approval  which the parties hope to obtain in under the terms of the agreement  genentech will produce enbrel through  with an extension through by mutual agreement 
in addition  wyeth is constructing a new manufacturing facility in ireland  which is expected to increase the us 
table of contents and canadian supply of enbrel 
if additional manufacturing capacity at the rhode island site  or pursuant to the genentech agreement  or if the ireland manufacturing facility is not completed  or if these manufacturing facilities do not receive fda approval before we encounter supply constraints  our enbrel sales would be restricted which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face substantial competition  and others may discover  develop  acquire or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated 
for example  enbrel competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by abbott laboratories knoll  centocor inc johnson johnson  aventis  pharmacia  and merck as well as the generic drug methotrexate and may face competition from potential therapies being developed by biogen  among others 
further  we believe that some of our newly approved products and late stage product candidates may face competition when and as they are approved and marketed 
for example  in the united states  aranesp competes with an epoetin alfa product marketed by johnson johnson in certain anemia markets and kineret competes in certain circumstances with rheumatoid arthritis products marketed by abbott laboratories knoll  centocor inc johnson johnson and others 
additionally  some of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  market products or are actively engaged in research and development in areas where we are developing product candidates 
large pharmaceutical corporations may have greater clinical  research  regulatory  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes 
these resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover  develop  and market new products 
certain of our raw materials  medical devices and components are single sourced from third parties  third party supply failures could adversely affect our ability to supply our products 
certain raw materials necessary for commercial manufacturing and formulation of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
also  certain medical devices and components necessary for fill  finish  and packaging of our products are provided by single source unaffiliated third party suppliers 
certain of these raw materials  medical devices  and components are the proprietary products of these unaffiliated third party suppliers and  in some cases  such proprietary products are specifically cited in our drug application with the fda so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the fda approved that other supplier 
we would be unable to obtain these raw materials  medical devices  or components for an indeterminate period of time if these third party single suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these materials or products to us for any reason  including due to regulatory requirements or action  due to adverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier  or due to labor shortages or disputes 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  certain of the raw materials required in the commercial manufacturing and the formulation of our products are derived from biological sources  including bovine serum and human serum albumin  or hsa 
we are investigating screening procedures with respect to certain biological sources and alternatives to them 
such raw materials may be subject to contamination and or recall 
a material shortage  contamination  and or recall could adversely impact or disrupt our commercial manufacturing of our products or could result in a mandated withdrawal of our products from the market 
this too  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our product development efforts may not result in commercial products 
we intend to continue an aggressive research and development program 
successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain  and very few research and development projects produce a 
table of contents commercial product 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in early human clinical trials  may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results the product candidate was not effective in treating a specified condition or illness the product candidate had harmful side effects on humans the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the fda  did not approve our product candidate for an intended use the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize other companies or people have or may have proprietary rights to our product candidate  such as patent rights  and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms  or at all the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics several of our product candidates have failed at various stages in the product development process  including brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and megakaryocyte growth and development factor mgdf 
for example  in  we announced the failure of bdnf for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  or lou gehrig s disease  because the product candidate  when administered by injection  did not produce acceptable clinical results for a specific use after a phase trial  even though bdnf had progressed successfully through preclinical and earlier clinical trials 
in addition  in  we discontinued development of mgdf  a novel platelet growth factor  at the phase trial stage after several people in platelet donation trials developed low platelet counts and neutralizing antibodies 
of course  there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product 
we cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products 
further  clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians  and others which may delay  limit  or prevent further clinical development or regulatory approvals of a product candidate 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products  and changes to or re approvals of our manufacturing facilities may be required  any of which could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations 
for example  because enbrel has only been marketed since  its long term effects on the development or course of serious infection  malignancy  and autoimmune disease are largely unknown and more rarely occurring side effects may not be known 
in may  immunex announced an update to the package insert for enbrel to advise doctors not to start using enbrel in patients who have an active infection  and for doctors to exercise caution when considering using enbrel in patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections 
in october  immunex again revised the package insert for enbrel in response to spontaneous adverse events reported to immunex  including rare cases of hematologic and central nervous system disorders 
the causal relationship between these adverse events and therapy with enbrel remains unclear 
in january  immunex revised the package insert for enbrel to advise doctors that rare cases of central nervous system disorders  including seizures  and 
table of contents rare cases of tuberculosis have also been reported in patients using enbrel 
it is possible that additional spontaneous adverse events will be reported to us as experience with enbrel continues 
if we or others identify new adverse events for patients treated with enbrel  additional precautions  warnings  or other changes in the label for enbrel may be required 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims 
product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products 
we face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval 
product liability claims  regardless of their merits  could be costly and divert management s attention  and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products 
our operating results may fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause financial results to be below expectations 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons 
in budgeting our operating expenses  we assume that revenues will continue to grow  however  some of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term 
because of this  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be below our expectations or projections 
a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
for example  we may face lower than expected demand for our products inability to provide adequate supply of our products changes in the government s or private payors reimbursement policies for our products changes in wholesaler buying patterns increased competition from new or existing products fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates changes in our product pricing strategies of these  we would only have control over changes in our product pricing strategies and  of course  there may be other factors that affect our revenues in any given period 
we plan to grow rapidly  and if we fail to adequately manage that growth our business could be adversely impacted 
we have an aggressive growth plan that includes substantial and increasing investments in research and development  sales and marketing and facilities 
our plan has a number of risks  some of which we cannot control 
for example we will need to generate higher revenues to cover a higher level of operating expenses  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control we will need to attract and assimilate a large number of new employees we will need to manage complexities associated with a larger and faster growing organization we will need to accurately anticipate demand for the products we manufacture and maintain adequate manufacturing capacity  and our ability to do so may depend on factors that we do not control of course  there may be other risks and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully manage these or other risks 

table of contents our stock price is volatile  which could adversely affect your investment 
our stock price  like that of other biotechnology companies  is highly volatile 
for example  in the fifty two weeks prior to december   the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
our stock price may be affected by such factors as clinical trial results adverse developments regarding the safety or efficacy of our products actual or anticipated product supply constraints product development announcements by us or our competitors regulatory matters announcements in the scientific and research community intellectual property and legal matters changes in reimbursement policies or medical practices broader industry and market trends unrelated to our performance in addition  if our revenues or earnings in any period fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate adverse impact on our stock price 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
the development  manufacturing  pricing  sales  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
see our current products and products in development cannot be sold if we do not obtain and maintain regulatory approval 
and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products if we or others identify side effects after our products are on the market 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on current best practices  we cannot assure you that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
our marketing of enbrel will be dependent in part upon wyeth 
under the amended and restated co promotion agreement  we and wyeth market and sell enbrel in the united states and canada 
an enbrel management committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from us and wyeth is responsible for overseeing the marketing and sales of enbrel  including strategic planning  approval of an annual marketing plan  product pricing  and establishing an enbrel brand team 
the enbrel brand team  with equal representation from us and wyeth  will prepare and implement the annual marketing plan and will be responsible for all sales activities 
if wyeth fails to market enbrel effectively or if we and wyeth fail to coordinate our efforts effectively  our sales of enbrel may be adversely affected 
guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products 
government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products 
however  professional societies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to 
table of contents the health care and patient communities 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  dosage  route of administration  and use of concomitant therapies 
organizations like these have in the past made recommendations about our products 
recommendations or guidelines that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our products 
in addition  the perception by the investment community or stockholders that recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use of our products could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our merger with immunex 
on july   we merged with immunex corporation 
the success of our merger with immunex will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings  and growth opportunities from integrating the businesses of immunex with the businesses of amgen 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of immunex 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly  and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others consolidating research and development and manufacturing operations retaining key employees consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures coordinating sales and marketing functions preserving ours and immunex s research and development  distribution  marketing  promotion  and other important relationships minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns coordinating geographically separate organizations in addition  even if we are able to integrate immunex s operations successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the synergies  cost savings  or sales and growth opportunities that we expect or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame 
for example  the elimination of significant duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred in integrating the companies 
we cannot assure you that the integration of immunex with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us to result from the merger 
our failure to achieve these benefits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income earned on the company s investment portfolio is generally affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements on a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio  effectively converting these fixed income investments to variable income investments 
the company s short term borrowings bear interest at variable rates and therefore  changes in us interest rates affect interest expense incurred thereon 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s medium and long term notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
the following tables provide information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the company s investment portfolio and debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  the company has assumed its available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
for the interest rate swaps  the tables present the notional amount and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract

these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
in  the company entered into equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of its equity investment portfolio 
at december  and  the fair value of the unhedged portion of its equity securities was million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  an adverse change in equity prices of would result in a decrease of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the unhedged portion of the company s equity securities 
price volatility for equity investments is based on the volatility of a relevant market index for small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology sector 
the company did not have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  and
