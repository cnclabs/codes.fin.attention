item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements that we have presented elsewhere in this annual report 
we have included in this annual report certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of concerning our business  operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements consist of all non historical information  and the analysis of historical information 
the words could  expects  anticipates  objective  plans  may affect  may depend  believes  estimates  projects and similar words and phrases may identify such forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements due to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including  among other things  unanticipated technological difficulties  the volatile and competitive environment for internet telephony and telecommunications  changes in domestic and foreign economic  market and regulatory conditions  the inherent uncertainty of financial estimates and projections  the difficulties of integrating businesses which were previously operated as stand alone units  the creditworthiness of our customers  the uncertainties involved in certain legal proceedings  instabilities arising from terrorist actions  war and responses thereto  future transactions and other considerations described as risk factors in exhibit to our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and in other filings made by us with the sec 
such factors may also cause substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
all such forward looking statements are current only as of the date on which such statements were made 
we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which any such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies and estimates itxc s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  intangible assets  restructuring and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies apply to and affects significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company estimates the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts required to reduce accounts receivable to expected net realized value by reviewing the status of significant past due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes telecommunications revenue and the related costs at the time the services are rendered 
telecommunications revenue is derived from fees charged to terminate voice and fax services over the company s network 
increased competition from other providers of internet telephony services and traditional telephony services could materially adversely affect revenue in future periods 
to date  the company has derived a significant portion of its revenue from a small number of customers 
the loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and future prospects 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows 
if such assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
property and equipment 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  the company must determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than its carrying amount 
if less  the company will be required to recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
the company is in the process of simplifying its network to eliminate the need for circuit switches in new installations  to lower costs and improve quality and reliability for its customers  and to reduce future capital 
table of contents costs and operating complexity 
in connection with the initiative  the company has commenced a plan to migrate to cisco based architecture 
these actions resulted in a million non cash impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of overview we are a leading global provider of voice and fax services 
we primarily use the internet for transport of these calls 
from our inception in july through april  our operating activities were focused primarily on developing monitoring and analysis software to enable us to efficiently and cost effectively route voice over the internet which we refer to as bestvalue routing  developing relationships with affiliates throughout the world to establish the global reach of itxc 
net  developing additional business strategies to supplement our affiliate network  and hiring our initial employee group 
in april  we launched our first service delivered over itxc 
net our wwexchange service 
our operations since that time have included increasing our voice traffic  from  minutes during april to approximately million minutes carried through our wwexchange service during the quarter ended december   refining our monitoring and analysis software in order to achieve bestvalue routing  expanding our affiliate network to affiliates at january   increasing the global reach of itxc 
net to countries at january applying for and securing patents on key technology  increasing our direct connection to customers using itxc owned snarcs located at the customers premises  and increasing our employee headcount  from employees on april  to employees on january  to date  our primary sources of revenue have been the fees that we receive from customers for terminating calls that they have originated 
our revenue for terminating calls over itxc 
net has depended primarily upon the following factors the volume of voice traffic carried over itxc 
net  which is measured in terms of minutes of voice traffic  the mix of voice traffic carried over itxc 
net  which reflects the fact that calls made over certain routes will generate greater revenues than calls of a similar duration made over other routes  pricing pressures resulting from competitive conditions in our markets  and our ability to maximize our buy sell margin  ie the difference between what we pay to receive termination service and what we are able to charge our customers 
competition from other providers of internet telephony services and traditional telephony services  failure of customers to meet payment obligations and regulatory developments could materially adversely affect revenue in future periods 
to date  we have derived a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers 
the loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and future prospects 
our operating expenses have been primarily data communications and telecommunications expenses 
internet related expenses  consisting primarily of costs associated with sending voice traffic  primarily fees that we pay to our affiliates to terminate or assist us in terminating calls  fees that we pay when we find it necessary to utilize the traditional telephone network or private data networks to terminate calls and expenses incurred in connecting our customers to our network  these expenses are largely proportional to the volume of voice traffic carried over our network  and costs associated with buying internet access at itxc operated locations  these costs are largely proportional to the bandwidth of access acquired and do not typically vary based upon volume of voice traffic until additional bandwidth needs to be acquired 

table of contents network operations expenses 
expenses associated with operating the network  consisting primarily of the salaries  payroll taxes and benefits that we pay for those employees directly involved in the operation of itxc 
net and related expenses 
during the period october through october that we operated an e commerce business  network operations expenses also include related expenses incurred to operate our e commerce services 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
there are three components of selling  general and administrative expenses  consisting of the following sales and marketing expenses 
salaries  payroll taxes  benefits and commissions that we pay for sales personnel and expenses associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns that are deployed both domestically and internationally 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in the future as we expand our internal sales force  hire additional marketing personnel and increase expenditures for promotion and marketing on a global level 
we expect that such expenses will also increase as telecommunications revenue increases 
development expenses 
salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses that we pay for employees and consultants who work on the development of our network management approaches and future applications of our technology 
we believe that investing in the enhancement of our technology is critical to our future success 
our development expenses may increase in future periods  based upon various factors  including the importance to us of bestvalue routing  the pace of technological change in our industry  and our goal of expanding the applications of our technology 
general and administrative expenses 
salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance  administration  facilities  information technology and human resources  together with accounts receivable reserves 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we hire additional personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
non cash employee compensation expenses 
non cash employee compensation represents compensation expense incurred in connection with the grant of certain stock options to our employees with exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock at the respective dates of grant 
during  but prior to our initial public offering  we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices equal to or less than fair value  resulting in non cash charges of approximately million 
similarly  in connection with our efusion acquisition during  we were required to take non cash charges of approximately thousand in connection with options granted in exchange for options previously granted by efusion 
our non cash employee compensation charges were fully expensed at the end of the second quarter of we believe that the services we provide over the internet are not currently actively regulated in the us several efforts have been made  however  to enact federal legislation that would regulate certain aspects of the internet 
in addition  the federal communications commission has been considering various initiatives that could affect the provision of internet telephony  its regulatory status  and the obligations to make payments to the universal service fund 
an adverse outcome of either regulatory proceedings or legislation could increase our costs significantly and could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and future prospects 
we anticipate that from time to time our operating expenses may increase on a per minute basis as a result of decisions to route additional traffic over the traditional telephone network or private data networks in order to maintain quality transmissions during relatively short periods of time as we transition our network to increased levels of capacity  or to meet peak demands 
during these periods  we occasionally experience reductions in volume from certain customers 
historically  we have satisfactorily resolved these transition issues 
however  in the future other anticipated or unanticipated operating problems associated with the growth of itxc 
net may develop 
on october   we acquired a interest in efusion  inc efusion  a provider of voice enabled applications to service providers  e commerce companies and call centers  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase price consisted primarily of million shares of our common stock and options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded goodwill of million and other intangibles of million  all of which were prior to the impairment charge described below to be amortized over five years 
we also purchased million of tangible net assets 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and accordingly  the net assets and results of operations of the acquired business have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of efusion  we immediately expensed the amount allocated to in process research and development of million in accordance with an independent third party valuation  as technological feasibility had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use as of the date of the acquisition 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
through december   and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
subsequent to requires recognition of impairment losses for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances result in impairment indicators being present and the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the expected future cash flows associated with the asset 
in response to current market conditions and the consequent slower than anticipated growth of the company s enhanced services  at its july board meeting the company made a strategic decision to reduce expenditures for the development and marketing of enhanced services and reduced headcount in these areas by about people 
as a result  the company revised its cash flow projections and determined that certain long lived assets related to its october efusion acquisition had become impaired 
during the second quarter of  the company recognized a million impairment charge  which represented an million write down of goodwill and a million write down of other intangible assets to their fair values 
on october   we sold most of the tangible and intangible assets of our e commerce business other than patents to estara  inc  a privately held provider of web voiced services  in exchange for a equity position in estara  which position has subsequently been diluted 
we valued this investment at thousand 
we granted certain patent licenses to estara  while retaining our ownership of such patents 
as a result  we determined that there was a further impairment of long lived assets and recorded a million impairment charge during the third quarter of to write down such assets to their fair value 
in addition  as part of our july and september business reorganization plans  we recorded a charge to earnings totaling approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of this charge is primarily comprised of headcount reductions of employees worldwide approximately million and facility consolidations approximately million as we closed the beaverton  oregon facility in which efusion had previously operated and terminated or transferred to estara the employees related to our e commerce business 
the remaining thousand relates to a write down of the remaining assets at the beaverton location 
on may  the company purchased assets which comprised the wholesale call completion business operated by privately held nexcom telecommunications llc nexcom in countries in eastern europe  for total consideration of million which consisted of million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
 of those shares and million in cash are subject to an escrow agreement supporting nexcom s indemnification obligations to the company 
nexcom had previously provided termination services to the company in most of the countries in which the assets are located 
in connection with the transaction  the company recorded goodwill of million  and other intangibles of million related to vendor agreements  customer lists and licenses  which will be amortized over periods ranging from to months 
these values were determined using an independent third party valuation 
also included in the purchase were million of property  plant and equipment 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the net assets and results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the acquisition would not have had a material impact on the company s results of operations  had the acquisition been completed at the beginning of the years presented 
since our inception in july  we have experienced operating losses in each quarterly and annual period and negative cash flows from operations in each quarter since we commenced offering services over itxc 
net in april as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the profit potential of our business is unproven  and our limited operating history makes an evaluation of us and our prospects difficult 
we may not achieve profitability or  if we achieve profitability  we might not sustain profitability 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue telecommunications revenue for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the principal aspect of this increase was the increased revenue generated from our wwexchange service  which provides international call completion to our customers and enables them to offer their own customers phone to phone global voice service 
almost all of our total revenue during was derived from our wwexchange service 
the remaining revenue was derived principally from our webtalknow service  a pc to telephone service which allows internet portals  internet service providers and web sites to offer web to phone calling to their customers under their own brands 
we have increased the volume of wwexchange service traffic over itxc 
net 
in terms of minutes of traffic  we increased our minutes to billion in from billion minutes in our average revenues per minute for wwexchange service 
table of contents declined to cents per minute in from cents per minute during the decline in average revenues per minute is primarily attributable to increased competition and changes in route mix 
our webtalknow traffic declined significantly from million minutes in to million minutes in as a result of the significant decline in the number and financial strength of the internet based so called dot 
com consumer businesses that formed a portion of the potential customer base of our webtalknow service and the greatly weakened financial condition of the surviving competitive local exchange carriers clecs 
the traffic increased slightly to million minutes in we increased our emphasis on margin  rather than revenue  beginning in and thereafter used margin as the major basis for sales compensation 
operating expenses data communications and telecommunications expenses 
during the past three years  the percentage relationship of data communications and telecommunications expenses to telecommunications revenue was as follows year ended december data communications and telecommunications expenses revenue percentage million million million million million million the year to year increases in the dollar amount of such costs primarily reflected the increased traffic during these years as well as costs associated with establishing and increasing capacity at our hubs in anticipation of future growth in traffic 
network operations expenses 
network operations expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  and increased from million during the year ended december  such expenses primarily reflected the cost of operating our hours a day  days a week network operations center  as well as start up costs associated with the new jersey  california and england hubs 
such costs represented  and  respectively  of telecommunications revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
this improvement in resulted from a number of factors  including the elimination of a duplicative network operation center in beaverton  absence of certain start up expenses associated with hubs brought online or improved in and an increased revenue base in in general  network operations expenses are not proportional to the volume of our traffic  regardless of our volume  we are required to pay the salaries and related costs associated with operating our network operations center in princeton 
we closed our new york hub and consolidated its operations with our new jersey hub in we anticipate that we will be able to continue to leverage network operations expenses over a larger revenue base in future periods 
such expectation represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ from such expectation as a result of a number of factors  including the extent to which we incur unanticipated expenses associated with the expansion of our hubs and the growth of our network 
in early we announced a new network hub in germany 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  and increased from million during the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to in from in and in  reflecting the leveraging of such expenses over our significantly increased revenue base 
this improvement in was mainly due to favorable experience in bad debt expense and to savings associated with the closing of the beaverton  oregon facility during and elimination of associated headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses during  and included charges of million  million and million  respectively  representing accounts receivable reserves and write offs 
accounts receivable reserves and bad debt experience have been in large part a function of the financial state of the telecommunications companies who are the company s customers 
the industry continues to experience bankruptcies of carriers  including large carriers such as worldcom and global crossing 
in order to minimize accounts receivable reserves and write offs  the company has closely monitored credit exposure to customers  has rejected customers that represented unacceptable credit risks  has limited the business the company would accept from customers whom the company judges to bear credit risk and has made significant efforts to assure that bilateral arrangements permit the offset of accounts receivable against accounts payable 
nonetheless  during the first quarter of the company ceased doing business with interactive marketing technologies inc imt  which is past due on over million of obligations from services provided by the company in the first quarter of imt has since sued the company  and while the company believes imt s lawsuit to be without merit  and the company will take all available steps to collect the debts owed  the collectibility of that debt is not certain 
the company anticipates charges against first quarter earnings of approximately million relating to imt 
at december   we had employees  as compared with employees one year earlier 

table of contents as our revenues continue to grow  we expect sg a expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
such expectation represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ from such expectation as a result of a number of factors  including the extent to which we incur unanticipated expenses associated with revenue growth and the extent to which our customers present unanticipated credit problems 
depreciation depreciation expense increased to million in from million in and million in  reflecting the expansion of our network and hubs and the addition of new technologies deployed throughout our network 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense was in  in and in we added capital expenditures of million during the adoption of the switchless architecture and standardization on cisco products is not expected to have a material effect on the level of depreciation expense in the immediate future 
amortization and write off of intangibles in connection with our may  acquisition of the assets of nexcom  we recorded million of goodwill and million of other intangibles 
approximately thousand of intangibles was amortized in in  we amortized million of intangibles and we recognized million of impairment charges related to the company s october efusion acquisition 
in  we amortized million of the goodwill associated with the efusion acquisition  amortized million of intangibles and wrote off million of in process research and development associated with our efusion acquisition 
impairment of fixed assets in the fourth quarter of we began the process of simplifying our network to eliminate the need for circuit switches in new installations 
the company is planning to evaluate existing installations to see if these installations can be similarly simplified to benefit customers 
accordingly  we recognized million of impairment charges related to the migration to a cisco based architecture and to a switch less environment 
in  we will continue our migration and the results of these may require us to write off up to million more of existing capital equipment  net  in future quarters 
restructuring charges during and  we incurred and million  respectively  of restructuring charges 
approximately million of charges in related to the sub lease on our headquarters space effective january the remaining charges in related to charges associated with real estate leases for our closed office in beaverton  oregon 
the company has reached a settlement with the landlord for the beaverton  oregon facility thus eliminating all future restructuring charges related to this lease 
charges in relate to the steps we took to terminate our e commerce operations in beaverton  oregon 
non cash employee compensation expenses non cash employee compensation expense was million during the year ended december   million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   representing amortization of deferred compensation incurred in connection with the grant of options at exercise prices less than fair value 
the decline in this charge during and reflects the cancellation of options held by individuals whom we no longer employ  as well as the completion of vesting periods for certain options 
our non cash employee compensation charges were fully expensed at the end of the second quarter of interest and other income our interest income  net  principally  represents income from cash and investments which  in turn  were derived from capital contributions made by our investors 
in addition to the capital invested near the inception of our business  we raised net proceeds of million and million from a group of investors in private transactions completed during april and february  respectively  we raised net proceeds of million from our initial public offering completed in october and we raised net proceeds of million from our follow on public offering completed in march during the years ended december   and  the interest on our marketable securities  including the interest earned on the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings  exceeded the interest that we paid on our line of credit and capital leases by million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in interest income  net  during and reflects a lowering of the rates that we earned on our cash and investments and the deployment of a portion of these assets into our operating business 
loss associated with investments and joint venture during  we determined that there was an other than temporary impairment in the value of our estara investment which resulted in a thousand charge in the fourth quarter 
the thousand charge recorded in related to a strategic 
table of contents investment that we made in a private e commerce company 
based on the poor financial condition and the remote probability of success  we believe that an other than temporary decline in this investment has occurred and accordingly we wrote off the investment in its entirety 
during  we incurred non cash charges of million relating to the modifications made in our south american joint venture 
approximately million of these charges reflected the difference between the value of our stock that we issued at the time of such modifications and the value of the capital stock that we received in exchange for that stock valued as of the time of the transaction 
the balance of these charges relates to a reduction in the value of the shares that we received  reflecting an other than temporary decline in such investment

at that date  future minimum payments for non cancelable leases include required payments of million during and million for years and thereafter under all leases 
the minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum operating sublease rentals of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases

net and the development of future applications of our technology  our success in marketing and selling our services  and other factors 
we have experienced substantial increases in our capital expenditures since our inception  consistent with growth in our operations and staffing  and we anticipate that our capital expenditures will continue to increase in the future 
we will evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses  technologies or services and plan to expand our sales and marketing programs 
any such possible acquisition may be material and may require us to incur a significant amount of debt or issue a significant number of equity securities 
further  any businesses that we acquire will likely have their own capital needs  which may be significant  which we would be called upon to satisfy independent of the acquisition price 
we currently believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
this statement represents a forward looking statement under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from our expectations
