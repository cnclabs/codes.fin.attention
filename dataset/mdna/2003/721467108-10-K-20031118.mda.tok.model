item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
product liability 
product liability claims or product recalls can adversely affect our business reputation and expose us to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulators 

table of contents the packaging  marketing and distribution of food products entail an inherent risk of product liability and product recall and the resultant adverse publicity 
we may be subject to significant liability if the consumption of any of our products causes injury  illness or death 
we could be required to recall certain of our products in the event of contamination or damage to the products 
in addition to the risks of product liability or product recall due to deficiencies caused by our production or processing operations  we may encounter the same risks if any third party tampers with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to perform product recalls  or that product liability claims will not be asserted against us  in the future 
any claims that may be made may create adverse publicity that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as described above under contamination of products if our poultry products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls  we recently voluntarily recalled all cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities from may  through october  in connection with this recall  we were recently named as a defendant in four lawsuits brought by individuals alleging injuries resulting from contracting listeria monocytogenes 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurance that any litigation or reputational injury associated with this or any future product recalls will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully or on our business  reputation  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
our business operations entail a number of risks  including risks relating to product liability claims  product recalls  property damage and injuries to persons 
we currently maintain insurance with respect to certain of these risks  including product liability insurance  property insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance  but in many cases such insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and no assurance can be given that such insurance can be maintained in the future on acceptable terms  or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to any such events  or at all 
moreover  even though our insurance coverage may be designed to protect us from losses attributable to certain events  it may not adequately protect us from liability and expenses we incur in connection with such events 
for example  we expect losses attributable to our october recall of cooked deli products produced at one of our facilities to significantly exceed available insurance coverage 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  in the past one of our insurers encountered financial difficulties and was unable to fulfill its obligations under one of our insurance policies and one of our insurers contested coverage with respect to a claim forcing us to litigate the issue of coverage 
although we have maintained product recall insurance in recent periods  in the availability of this type of insurance to the food industry has been limited and at times not available 
on november   the company bound such insurance coverage for certain recall related risks  although the deductible for such coverage has been increased to million 

table of contents significant competition 
competition in the chicken and turkey industries with other vertically integrated poultry companies  especially companies with greater resources  may make us unable to compete successfully in these industries  which could adversely affect our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are highly competitive 
some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
in both the united states and mexico  we primarily compete with other vertically integrated poultry companies 
in general  the competitive factors in the us poultry industry include price  product quality  brand identification  breadth of product line  and customer service 
competitive factors vary by major market 
in the foodservice market  competition is based on consistent quality  product development  service and price 
in the us retail market  we believe that competition is based on product quality  brand awareness and customer service 
further  there is some competition with non vertically integrated further processors in the us prepared food business 
in mexico  where product differentiation has traditionally been limited  product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors 
additionally  the north american free trade agreement  which went into effect on january   required annual reductions in tariffs for chicken and chicken products in order to eliminate those tariffs by january  on november   the mexican secretariat of the economy announced that it would initiate an investigation to determine whether a temporary safeguard action was warranted to protect the domestic poultry industry when import tariffs on poultry were eliminated in january in july  the united states and mexico entered into a safeguard agreement with regard to imports into mexico of chicken leg quarters from the united states 
under this agreement  a tariff rate for chicken leg quarters of of the sales price was established 
this tariff will be reduced on january  and each of the following four years in equal increments so that the final tariff rate at january  will be zero 
as those tariffs are reduced  increased competition from chicken imported into mexico from the united states may have a material adverse effect on the mexican chicken industry in general  and on our mexican operations in particular 
integration of conagra chicken division 
there can be no assurance that the acquisition of the conagra chicken division will be completed or  if completed  that our businesses can be combined successfully 

table of contents the pending acquisition of the conagra chicken division is subject to certain closing conditions  and there can be no assurance that these closing conditions will be satisfied or the acquisition completed 
in evaluating the terms of our pending acquisition of the conagra chicken division  we analyzed the respective businesses of pilgrim s pride and the conagra chicken division and made certain assumptions concerning their respective future operations 
a principal assumption was that the acquisition will produce operating results better than those historically experienced or presently expected to be experienced in the future by us in the absence of the acquisition 
there can be no assurance  however  that this assumption is correct or that the businesses of pilgrim s pride and the conagra chicken division will be successfully integrated in a timely manner 
synergies of conagra chicken division 
we may not achieve cost savings and enhanced growth from the acquisition if we do not successfully integrate the conagra chicken division operation 
we entered into the purchase agreement related to the conagra chicken division acquisition with the expectation that the acquisition will result in beneficial synergies  such as cost savings and enhanced growth 
any success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization  if any  depend upon the successful integration of the operations of the conagra chicken division into pilgrim s pride  and upon general and industry specific economic factors 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly  and time consuming process 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others transitioning and preserving the conagra chicken division s customer  contractor  supplier and other important third party relationships  integrating corporate and administrative infrastructures  coordinating sales and marketing functions  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  coordinating geographically separate organizations  and retaining key employees 
even if pilgrim s pride and the conagra chicken division are able to integrate their operations and economic conditions remain stable  there can be no assurance that the anticipated synergies will be achieved 
assumption of unknown liabilities 
liabilities of the conagra chicken division may harm our financial condition and operating results 
because the conagra chicken division acquisition is structured as a stock purchase  we will assume all of the liabilities of the conagra chicken division  including liabilities that may be unknown 
we negotiated and obtained from conagra foods certain representations and warranties concerning contingent liabilities and other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets to reduce the risk that we will bear such subsidiaries liability 
table of contents for unknown liabilities 
conagra foods also agreed to indemnify us for breaches of representations and warranties concerning the pre closing operations of the conagra chicken division and for certain liabilities of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets 
certain of conagra foods indemnification obligations are generally subject to a million deductible  and there may be circumstances in which conagra foods indemnification obligations do not provide us protection from contingent or other obligations of the entities holding the conagra chicken division assets  or other pre closing liabilities of the conagra chicken division 
these obligations and liabilities could harm our financial condition and operating results 
potential acquisitions 
we may pursue opportunities to acquire complementary businesses  which could increase leverage and debt service requirements and could adversely affect our financial situation if we fail to successfully integrate the acquired business 
we intend to pursue selective acquisitions of complementary businesses in the future 
inherent in any future acquisitions are certain risks such as increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following such acquisitions 
additional debt or equity capital may be required to complete future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the required capital 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  lack of experience in operating in the geographical market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these and other factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated cash flows at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
foreign operations risks 
our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations 
we have substantial operations and assets located in mexico 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  
table of contents expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected us in the past 
exchange rate fluctuations or one or more other risks may have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our operations in mexico are conducted through subsidiaries organized under the laws of mexico 
we may rely in part on intercompany loans and distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our claims 
additionally  the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make payments and distributions to us will be subject to  among other things  mexican law 
in the past  these laws have not had a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions 
however  laws such as these may have a material adverse effect on the ability of our mexican subsidiaries to make these payments and distributions in the future 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken and turkey industries are subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including in the health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future 
control of voting stock 
voting control over pilgrim s pride is maintained by lonnie bo pilgrim and lonnie ken pilgrim 
through a number of family trusts and limited partnerships  lonnie bo pilgrim and his son lonnie ken pilgrim presently have voting control of of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and will continue to have voting control of our common stock following the completion of the conagra chicken division acquisition 
they are  therefore  in a position to control the outcome of all actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this ensures their ability to control the future direction and management of pilgrim s pride 
if lonnie bo pilgrim and certain members of his family cease to own at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock  it will constitute an event of default under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
risks associated with tax status 
potential payment of deferred taxes may affect our cash flow 
before july   we used the cash method of accounting for income tax purposes 
pursuant to changes in the laws enacted by the revenue act of  we were required to change our method of accounting for federal income tax purposes from the cash method to the accrual 
table of contents method 
as a consequence of this change in our accounting method  we were permitted to create a suspense account in the amount of approximately million 
this account represents deferred income arising from our prior use of the cash method of accounting 
beginning in fiscal  we are generally required to include th of the amount in the suspense account  or approximately million  in taxable income each year for the next years 
as of september   approximately million remained to be included in our taxable income in future years 
however  the full amount must be included in taxable income in any year that pilgrim s pride ceases to be a family corporation 
we will cease to be a family corporation if lonnie bo pilgrim s family ceases to own at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote 
if that occurs  we would be required to recognize the balance of the suspense account in taxable income 
currently there exists no plan or intention on the part of lonnie bo pilgrim s family to transfer enough pilgrim s pride stock so that we cease to qualify as a family corporation 
however  this may happen  and the suspense account might be required to be included in our taxable income 
deferred taxes 
potential accrual of deferred taxes may affect our net income and cash flow 
we have not provided any deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our mexico subsidiaries based upon the determination that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested 
as of september   the cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately million 
if these earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us and foreign income taxes would have been provided  after consideration of estimated foreign tax credits 
however  determination of the amount of deferred federal and foreign income taxes is not practical
