table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of december   we owned and operated full service restaurants  or bistros  that combine a distinctive blend of high quality  traditional chinese cuisine and american hospitality in a sophisticated  contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original pf chang s restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team  led by richard federico and robert vivian  pf chang s chief executive officer and president  respectively  to support pf chang s founder  paul fleming 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we also owned and operated limited service restaurants as of december  we believe that there is an opportunity to leverage our knowledge and expertise in chinese and asian cuisine 
accordingly  we have developed pei wei asian diner  or pei wei  a new concept that will cater to a quicker  more casual dining experience as compared to pf chang s china bistro 
pei wei opened its first unit in july in the phoenix  arizona area  four units in  and eleven units in these restaurants are located in arizona  dallas  texas and southern california 
we intend to open new bistros in the majority of full service units that we intend to develop in will be located in new markets across the united states 
we have signed lease agreements or letters of intent for all of our development planned for fiscal we intend to continue to develop full service restaurants that typically range in size from  square feet to  square feet  and that require  on average  a total cash investment of approximately million and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
we also intend to develop pei wei restaurants in we will continue our development in the phoenix  dallas and southern california markets and plan to enter additional markets in houston  texas  las vegas  nevada  and denver  colorado 
our pei wei sites are generally around  to  square feet in size and require an average total cash investment of approximately  and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant 
preopening expenses at pei wei are expected to total approximately  per restaurant

table of contents quarterly results the following tables set forth certain unaudited quarterly information for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the two year period ended december   expressed as a percentage of revenues  except for revenues which are expressed in thousands 
this quarterly information has been prepared on a consistent basis with the audited financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  and operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year 
the operating results of pf chang s for such eight fiscal quarters expressed as a percentage of revenues  except for revenues which are expressed in thousands  were as follows fiscal fiscal first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs cost of sales labor operating occupancy total restaurant operating costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization preopening expense income from operations interest income expense  net income before minority interest and provision for income taxes minority interest income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income certain percentage amounts do not sum to total due to rounding 
historically  pf chang s has experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to preopening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding and the month of the opening of the restaurant 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had and is expected to continue to have a meaningful impact on 
table of contents preopening expenses  labor and operating costs until such time as a larger base of restaurants in operation mitigates such impact 
liquidity and capital resources pf chang s has funded its capital requirements since its inception through sales of equity securities  debt financing and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded the net income for the periods due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  an increase in operating liabilities and the effect of minority interest 
we use cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal years  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
investment activities consisted of capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  as well as investments in short term instruments of million and in long term instruments of million in fiscal and sales of short term instruments of million in fiscal we intend to open new bistro restaurants and new pei wei restaurants in fiscal year we expect that our planned future bistro restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment per restaurant of approximately million 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant 
total cash investment per each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  with preopening expenses estimated at  per location 
net cash provided by used in financing activities in fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of borrowings under our credit facility offset by distributions to our partners 
financing activities in fiscal year consisted principally of the proceeds from our private equity placement  offset by the subsequent repayment of the borrowings under our credit facility and distributions to our partners 
financing activities in fiscal year consisted primarily of repayments on long term debt  distributions to our partners and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in december of  the company entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility with a commercial lending institution 
the credit facility allows for borrowings up to million at an interest rate ranging from to basis points over the applicable london interbank offered rate libor 
at any time  but only one time  the company has the right to increase the credit facility up to the maximum aggregate principal amount of million provided the company is in compliance with the terms of the facility 
the revolving credit facility expires on december  and contains certain restrictions and conditions which require the company to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth  an adjusted leverage ratio at a maximum of  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio no less than shares of the company s subsidiary  pei wei asian diner  inc serve as collateral for the credit facility 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december  our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of its available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through in the event that additional capital is required  we will first access our existing credit facility 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financings 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we can not assure you that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   there were partners within the pf chang s china bistro  inc system 
during  we purchased the interests of six of our minority partners for a total of approximately million  of which the majority was recorded as intangibles 
approximately million of the total purchase price was paid in cash while the remaining balance has been recorded as debt on the balance sheet at december  these transactions were accretive to the company s financial results for the year ended 
table of contents december  and resulted in an additional of earnings per share given that increased amortization expense was less than the portion of earnings that would have been charged to minority interest 
in  we will have the opportunity to purchase additional partnership interests 
if all of these interests are fully purchased in their entirety  the total purchase price will approximate to million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at december  such amounts are subject to change based upon changes in the estimated fair value of the respective interests from december  through the date of purchase 
if all of these interests are purchased by the company in  the estimated financial impact would be an additional of earnings per share 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
partnership structure pf chang s utilizes a partnership structure to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of its restaurants 
each partner is required to make a cash capital contribution at fair value in exchange for a specified interest in the restaurant or region the partner is also separately employed to manage 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and seven percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  pf chang s has the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair market value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows of the subject restaurant s or region s financial results 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash or common stock of the company over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
periodically we hire third party appraisers to verify that our methodology for estimating fair value is appropriate 
the use of fair value in these transactions is critical to the accounting treatment of these transactions as fair value equity purchases and sales 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant  or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
impairment of goodwill at least annually  we assess the recoverability of goodwill that is related to our purchase of interests in various restaurants at the formation of pf chang s 
we test impairment at the concept level for this goodwill and use historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we utilize estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our own estimates based on pf chang s actual historical trends 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  reserves might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded or actual experience could be more favorable then estimated resulting in expense reductions 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
eliminates the provisions of eitf no 
that required a liability to be recognized for certain exit or disposal activities at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
sfas no 
requires a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  pf chang s does not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
as allowed by sfas no 
 the company has elected to continue to utilize the accounting method prescribed by apb opinion no 
and has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  insurance and utility costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage can affect our labor costs 
additionally  further increases in workers compensation and health insurance costs could also affect our labor costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s management believes that the market risk associated with pf chang s market risk sensitive instruments as of december  is not material  and therefore  disclosure is not required
