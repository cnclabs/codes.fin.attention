significant customers for the fiscal years ended september      and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for     and  respectively  of total revenues 
page 
table of contents revenues from operations outside the united states for the fiscal years ended september      and  revenues from operations outside the united states comprised approximately     and  respectively  of total revenues 
for fiscal  substantially all such foreign revenues related to our offices in the united kingdom  ireland  france  spain and italy  with a small portion relating to our operations in india 
as a result of the acquisition of the stork e c businesses parts of which we completed in fiscal and fiscal  we expanded our european operations into the netherlands  belgium  and germany  and we acquired operations in southeast asia 
as a result of the acquisition of the gibb businesses which we completed in fiscal  we further expanded our operations in the united kingdom  and acquired businesses in other european countries 
finally  as a result of the acquisition of delta completed in october we further expanded our business in north america to include canada 
although we have foreign operations located elsewhere around the world in addition to those in europe  canada  and asia  revenues earned over the past five years from these other operations were not material 
contracts while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake  our contracts generally fall into three broad categories cost reimbursable  fixed price  and guaranteed maximum price 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september cost reimbursable fixed price guaranteed maximum price in accordance with industry practice  most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
when we are directly responsible for engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client s plant or facility  we reflect the costs of materials  equipment  and subcontracts in both revenues and costs 
on other projects  where the client elects to pay for such items directly  these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 
the following table presents the approximate amount of such pass through costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september in millions cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit 
the profit element may be in the form of a simple mark up applied to the labor costs incurred on a contract or it may be in the form of a fee  or a combination of a mark up and a fee 
the fee element can also take several forms 
the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract  it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred  or it may be an incentive fee based on targets  milestones  or performance factors defined in the contract 
in general  we prefer cost reimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 
page 
table of contents fixed price contracts fixed price contracts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum bid contracts 
under a negotiated fixed price contract  we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client 
negotiated fixed price contracts frequently exist in single responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project 
under lump sum bid contracts  we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes 
this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process  including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications  problems with new technologies  and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
thus  although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client  the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us 
however  because of economies that may be realized during the contract term  both negotiated fixed price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts 
over the past five years  most of our fixed price work has been either negotiated fixed price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 
guaranteed maximum price contracts guaranteed maximum price gmax contracts are performed in the same manner as cost reimbursable contracts  however  the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client 
if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price  then we will bear at least some  if not all  of the excess 
in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price  we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client 
these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients  which is contrary to our relationship based business model 
competition we engage in a highly competitive business 
some of our competitors are larger than us or are subsidiaries of larger companies  and therefore may possess greater resources than we do 
furthermore  because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital  there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications 
accordingly  we compete with regional  national  and international firms 
within any specific geographic area  certain competitors  including regional competitors  may possess greater resources than we do 
the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate 
our largest competitors for engineering  construction  and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel group  inc  fluor corporation  foster wheeler corp  kellogg brown root  aker kvaerner  technip  and amec plc 
in the area of buildings  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr  inc  hellmuth  obata kassabaum  aecom technology  turner construction  and day zimmermann 
in the area of infrastructure  our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff  urs corporation  hntb  and ws atkins 
in the area of pulp and paper  our principal competitors include be k  and amec plc

item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
in addition  as a contractor for many agencies of the united states government  we are subject to many levels of audits  investigations and claims by  or on behalf of  the government with respect to contract performance  pricing  costs  cost allocations and procurement practices

the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and the financial statements of any business entity performing long term engineering and construction type contracts  requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities 
although our significant accounting polices are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
page 
table of contents revenue accounting for contracts in accounting for long term  engineering and construction type contracts  we follow the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  we recognize revenues at the time we provide services 
depending on the commercial terms of the contracts  we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred  or using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion 
contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
the nature of our business results in clients  subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur  or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible 
similarly  and in the normal course of business  we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible 
in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract  we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore  the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate  based on the relevant facts and circumstances available  of the additional costs to be incurred 
in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible  we may present a claim to the client for such costs 
we will include in revenues the amount of costs incurred  without profit  to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue  and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 
certain cost reimbursable contracts with the us federal government as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment 
in this situation  revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts 
in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract  we will estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 
as is common in the industry  we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through partnerships and joint ventures 
for certain of these contracts ie  where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture  we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues  costs and operating profit in our consolidated statement of earnings 
for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures  we use the equity method of accounting 
insurance matters  litigation  claims  and contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance 
most of the litigation involves the company as a defendant in workers compensation  personal injury  environmental  environmental exposure  professional liability  and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured  or completely uninsured 
additionally  our income  franchise and similar tax returns and filings are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the united states  as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims  guarantees  litigation  and audits and investigations 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance page 
table of contents related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis  but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates 
we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
testing goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the amount of goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheet is tested annually for possible impairment 
in conducting the impairment test  we may apply  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
these techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 
since the adoption of sfas in fiscal  we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 
operations outside the united states in general  our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local currencies 
in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 
accounting for pensions as more fully explained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans 
the one remaining us pension plan  which was acquired in connection with our merger with sverdrup corporation  was frozen in  allowing no new participants to enter 
our other pension plans cover employees of certain of our international subsidiaries 
we account for these plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions 
sfas requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost  and the value of the plans assets and liabilities 
these assumptions involve discount rates  investment returns  and projected salary increases  among others 
we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans  and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used 
during fiscal  we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of to in fiscal to a range of to in fiscal we believe this reduction better reflects the long term returns expected on the plans assets  considering projected rates of inflation  the diversification of the plans assets  and the expected real rates of market returns 
changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities  and the associated pension expense 
management  together with our actuaries  monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 
also discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements is our obligation to form a pension plan and an early retirement plan vut for substantially all of our employees located in the netherlands 
these plans will replace existing programs sponsored by stork nv when the replacement plans are designed and formed  we will negotiate with both stork nv and the trustees of the existing multi employer plans to set a value of the assets to be transferred into the replacement plans 
although we have not finalized the design of the replacement pension and vut plans  we page 
table of contents expect that the value of the assets that will be transferred will be less than the value of the benefit obligations we will agree to assume 
such prior service cost will be amortized against earnings over the future estimated service period of our employees in the netherlands 
results of operations our business is focused exclusively on providing technical  professional  and construction services to a large number of industrial  commercial  and governmental clients around the world 
the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering  design  architectural  and similar services  construction services which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities  operations and maintenance o m services which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large  complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities  and process  scientific  and systems consulting services which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients 
the scope of services we can provide our clients  therefore  ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete  single responsibility  design build operate contracts 
the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september in thousands project services construction operations and maintenance process  scientific and systems consulting beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we classify certain elements of revenues as construction that were classified previously as project services 
consequently  we reclassified approximately million of project services revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to construction revenues 
revenues for fiscal have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal and presentation 
we focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit cross utilization of our resources 
the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september in thousands oil gas and refining federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers technology and manufacturing buildings infrastructure pulp and paper other other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products  and basic resources such as mining  minerals  and fertilizers 
page 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion compared to fiscal our revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a million  or decline in pass through costs 
the amount of pass through costs included in revenues during fiscal totaled billion compared to billion during fiscal the level of pass through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and o m projects 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pass through costs 
as a percentage of revenues  direct costs of contracts were for fiscal compared to for fiscal the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses included the impact of the operations of mcdermott engineers constructors canada limited including delta catalytic and delta hudson engineering  collectively delta for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal  since we completed the acquisition of delta on october  had delta s operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal  sg a expenses would have been higher by an additional million 
as a percentage of revenues  consolidated sg a expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending 
despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal  our operating profit defined as revenues  less direct costs of contracts and sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating profit increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in our operating profit was due primarily to improved margins 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal due to significantly reduced borrowing levels 
in august we entered into a new  five year million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
the previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in january amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities totaled million bearing interest of at september   compared to million bearing interest of at september  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 
we recorded income tax expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our overall effective tax rate was for both fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal on april   we completed a two for one stock split which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend to stockholders of record on march  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the stock split transaction 
page 
table of contents on october   we completed the acquisition of delta 
as more fully explained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  delta provides engineering  construction  and maintenance services to clients in a variety of industries  with significant revenues attributable to clients in the upstream oil and gas  petroleum refining  energy and other industries 
during fiscal  we completed the purchase from lawgibb group inc of substantially all of its international engineering and construction management business the gibb businesses  and finalized the second phase of the two part transaction to acquire from stork nv  the netherlands certain engineering and contracting businesses stork phase ii 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the stork and gibb transactions 
our operating results for fiscal and fiscal were not significantly impacted by the operations of gibb and stock phase ii 
we recorded net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the fiscal year ended september   compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share for fiscal effective october   we eliminated the amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our results of operations for prior years have not been restated 
goodwill amortization on a pre tax basis was million million after tax in fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of sfas total revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion  compared to total revenues of billion in fiscal approximately  or million of revenues in fiscal were generated by delta s operations 
sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal reflects the inclusion of the operations of delta  gibb and stork phase ii  which contributed a combined total of million to sg a expenses 
excluding the impact of the delta and gibb acquisitions  and the impact of eliminating goodwill amortization in fiscal  sg a expenses increased by million  or  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  consolidated sg a expenses was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal during fiscal  our operating profit increased by million  or  to million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in our operating profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increases in business volume  combined with the elimination of goodwill amortization  and with keeping direct costs of contracts and sg a expenses as percentages of revenues at approximately the same levels as fiscal operating profit was of revenues in fiscal  compared to of revenues in fiscal excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  our operating profit would have been of revenues in fiscal during fiscal  interest expense decreased by million  or  to million  compared to interest expense of million during fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to significantly reduced borrowing levels 
at september   we had total debt of million  compared to million at september  we financed the delta acquisition in october with a new  short term million credit facility 
by september  we had converted this credit facility to a long term  million facility due in january at september   this long term facility had an outstanding balance of million bearing interest of 
at september  and  outstanding borrowings and the associated interest rates under the million revolving credit facility were million bearing interest of  and million bearing interest of  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 
page 
table of contents we recorded income tax expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our overall effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal backlog backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us 
our policy with respect to o m contracts  however  is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year  regardless of the remaining life of the contract 
for federal programs other than federal o m contracts  our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award  whether funded or unfunded  and exclude option periods 
in accordance with industry practice  substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client 
however  we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts 
in a situation where a client terminates a contract  we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and  in certain instances  we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 
while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog  our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 
the following table summarizes our total backlog at september   and in millions technical professional services total in fiscal  we began classifying as field services backlog  certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as technical professional services backlog 
backlog for fiscal years has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
total backlog at september  included approximately billion  or of total backlog  relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies 
this compares to approximately billion or and billion or of us federal backlog at september  and  respectively 
most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year 
in general  these contracts must be funded annually ie  the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by congress to the procuring agency  and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 
our backlog for fiscal increased by million  or  to billion  compared to fiscal  and increased in fiscal by million  or  to billion  compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil gas  and refining industries  combined with new us federal program awards 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was also attributable primarily to oil gas  and refining backlog added as a result of the delta acquisition 
also contributing to the increase in backlog from fiscal to fiscal were new awards in both the civil and infrastructure  and the us federal programs sectors of our business 
we estimate that approximately billion  or of total backlog at september  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 
page 
table of contents effects of inflation during fiscal   and  approximately   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues were realized from cost reimbursable type contracts 
because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low 
however  as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed price and lump sum work is more prevalent  inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future 
to the extent permitted by competition  we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts with fixed price and lump sum terms  we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our business  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
at september   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and a new  five year million revolving credit facility discussed below 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million  to million 
this compares to a net decrease of million  to million during fiscal  and to a net decrease of million  to million during fiscal during fiscal  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities  and the effect on cash of exchange rate changes of million and million  respectively 
these inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing and financing activities of million and million  respectively 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal this compares to net cash inflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in inflows of million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts  partially offset by an increase in net earnings of million  and an increase in inflows relating to deferred income taxes of million 
in determining the amount we fund our defined benefit pension plans  we consider various factors including the minimum amounts required under applicable law  the tax deductibility of any contribution we make  and the effect of the funding on the future returns on plan assets 
although management continues to evaluate and monitor our future funding options and requirements  we expect the funding amounts to range from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the net cash we used for investing activities was million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the net decrease of million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease of million in net cash used for acquisitions  a net decrease in other noncurrent assets of million  a decrease in additions to property and equipment of million  and an increase of million in proceeds from sales of investments 
these inflows were partially offset by an increase of million in purchases of investments  and a decrease in disposals of property and equipment of million 
our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of million during fiscal this compares to net cash outflows of million and net cash inflows of million during fiscal and  respectively 
the million net decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to decreases in repayments of long term page 
table of contents borrowings and purchases of common stock for treasury of million and million  respectively  and an increase of million in proceeds from issuance of common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our only source for long term credit is a revolving credit agreement for million 
the total amounts outstanding under this facility at september  was million 
this agreement expires in august of  and provides for both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 
foreign currency risk in general  our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states  which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  into the us dollar 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because  in general  our various operations invoice page

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies  we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs
