expansion management of the bank continues to look for opportunities to expand the bank s branch network by seeking new branch locations and or by acquiring other financial institutions to diversify its customer base in order to compete for new deposits and loans  and to be able to serve its customers more effectively 
on june   the bank opened a new branch in brooklyn  new york  and on september   the bank opened a new branch in sacramento  northern california 
in addition  with china s accession into the world trade organization and its increasing importance in the world economy  the bank opened a representative office in shanghai  china  on april  competition the banking business in california  and specifically in the market areas served by most of the bank s branch offices  is highly competitive 
the bank competes for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and thrift institutions  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
in addition  the bank also competes with other entities both governmental and private industry that are seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities 
many of these institutions and entities offer services that are not offered directly by the bank and have substantially greater financial resources than does the bank 
the direction of federal legislation in recent years seems to favor increased competition between different types of financial institutions and to foster new entrants into the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which has the effect of dissolving historical barriers that limit participation in certain markets  increasing the cost of doing business for banks  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors can also be expected to have an ongoing impact on increasingly competitive conditions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon the following local promotional activities personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking  and sunday banking in certain locations internet banking an internet website  located at www 
cathaybank 
com certain other specialized services for customers whose loan demands exceed the bank s lending limit  the bank has attempted in the past  and intends in the future  to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with correspondent banks 
the bank also assists customers requiring other services not offered by the bank to obtain such services from its correspondent banks 
in southern california  at least three other chinese american banks of comparable size provide particular competition for loans and deposits with the bank and at least two super regional banks provide such competition for deposits 
in northern california  one of these chinese american banks provide particular competition for loans and deposits with the bank and the same two super regional banks provide such competition for deposits as well 
in addition  there are many other chinese american banks in both southern and northern california 
banks from the pacific rim countries  such as taiwan  hong kong  and china also continue to open branches in the los angeles area  thus increasing competition in the bank s primary markets

the bank holding company act requires bancorp to file annual reports of its operations with the federal reserve 
bancorp is also subject to examination by the federal reserve 
the bank  as a california state chartered commercial bank  is regulated by the federal deposit insurance corporation or fdic  and by the california department of financial institutions 
the bank s deposits are insured up to the legal maximum by the fdic 
although not a member of the federal reserve  the bank is subject to federal and state rules and regulations 
regulatory authorities review key operational areas of bancorp and the bank  including asset quality  capital adequacy  liquidity  management and administrative ability  compliance with consumer protection laws and security of confidential customer information 
applicable law and regulations also limit the business activities in which bancorp  the bank  and its subsidiaries may be engaged 
see also  other banking regulations interstate banking and federal limits on the activities and investments of state chartered banks below 
bancorp also files periodic reports  proxy statements  and other information with the securities and exchange commission  and is subject to federal and state securities laws  including the sarbanes oxley act of  which contains provisions dealing with corporate governance and management  disclosure  oversight of the accounting profession  and auditor independence 
the following summary describes some of the more significant laws  regulations  and policies that affect our operations 
it is not a complete listing of all laws that apply to bancorp and the bank 
to the extent that the information in this section  regulation of bancorp  and the bank  describes statutory or regulatory provisions  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to such provisions 
regulatory environment the banking and financial services industry is heavily regulated 
regulations  statutes  and policies affecting the industry are frequently under review by congress  state legislatures  and the federal and state agencies charged with supervisory and examination authority over banking institutions 
this regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect the bank s depositors  the federal deposit insurance fund  and the safety and soundness of the regulated financial institutions 
generally  the regulatory framework is not intended to protect our stockholders 
we expect that changes in the banking and financial services industry will continue to occur in the future 
some of the changes may create opportunities for us to compete in financial markets with less regulation 
however  these changes also may create new competitors in geographic and product markets which have historically been limited by law to banking institutions  such as the bank 
we cannot predict how changes in regulations  statutes  or policies will impact us 
these changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings 
fiscal and monetary policies the operations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit 
the federal reserve uses the following instruments of monetary policy  among others  as a means to implement its objectives open market purchases and sales of us government securities  changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits and borrowings by banks and their affiliates 
the federal reserve uses these instruments of monetary policy in varying combinations to seek to influence the overall level of bank loans  investments and deposits  the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits  the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets  and the level of inflation 
the federal reserve s fiscal and monetary policies will continue to have a significant effect on bancorp and the bank 
bank holding company regulation as a bank holding company  bancorp is subject to regulation  supervision  and examination by the federal reserve 
it is required to file reports with the federal reserve and furnish such other information as may be required by the federal reserve under the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve has a policy that bank holding companies must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks and may not conduct their operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
it is the federal reserve s position that bank holding companies should stand ready to use their available resources to provide adequate capital to their subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
bank holding companies should also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting their subsidiary banks 
if a bank holding company fails in these requirements  the federal reserve will generally consider such failure to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the federal reserve s regulations or both 
the federal reserve also has the authority to regulate bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  the federal reserve may require bancorp to file written notice and obtain its approval prior to purchasing or redeeming bancorp s equity securities 
bancorp must also obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve if it acquires more than of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities or substantially all of the assets of a bank or bank holding company 
the federal reserve must also give prior approval to any merger or consolidation with another bank holding company 
in addition  under the bank holding company act  bancorp cannot acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company 
it cannot engage directly or indirectly in activities other than banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  there are some statutory exceptions 
subject to prior approval of the federal reserve  bancorp can acquire shares of companies engaged in activities that the federal reserve deems to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks 
in addition  as discussed below under financial services modernization legislation  if bancorp becomes a financial holding company  certain restrictions on acquiring ownership or control of certain non banking companies will no longer apply 
financial services modernization legislation on november   president clinton signed into law the gramm leach bliley act of referred to in this report as the modernization act  which among other things revised the bank holding company act 
effective march   the modernization act repealed the two affiliation provisions of the glass steagall act that restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating 
the modernization act repealed section of the glass steagall act  which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and section of the glass steagall act  which restricted officer  director  or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  the modernization act expressly preempted any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the law established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers 
the modernization act revised and expanded the bank holding company act framework and permitted a bank holding company to engage in additional types of financial activities provided that it became a financial holding company under the modernization act 
such financial activities include banking  insurance  securities activities  merchant banking  and additional activities incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
to affiliate with other financial service providers  we would have to become a financial holding company 
we would have to file a declaration with the federal reserve  electing to engage in activities permissible for financial holding companies and certify that we are eligible to do so because the bank is well capitalized and well managed 
the federal reserve must also determine that the bank  as the insured depository institution subsidiary  has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act 
we have not sought to become a financial holding company 
we will continue to monitor our strategic business plan  market conditions  and other factors to determine whether we will elect to become a financial holding company and take advantage of the expanded powers provided in the modernization act 
under the modernization act  securities firms and insurance companies that become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company other than a bank holding company  bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve 
prior federal reserve approval is required before a financial holding company acquires the beneficial ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a bank holding company  bank or savings association 
to the extent that the modernization act permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the modernization act also added a new section to the federal deposit insurance act 
the new section allows subsidiaries of state banks to engage in activities as principal that would only be permissible for a national bank to conduct in a financial subsidiary 
it expressly preserved a state bank s right to retain all existing subsidiaries 
california permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
under the modernization act  a national bank subsidiary may engage in any financial activity which may be conducted through a financial holding company subsidiary  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development or merchant banking 
therefore  the bank can form subsidiaries to engage in the activities authorized by the modernization act to the same extent as a national bank 
to form a financial subsidiary  the bank must be well capitalized and meet other regulatory requirements 
see other banking regulations federal limits on the activities and investments of state chartered banks below 
the modernization act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that bancorp and the bank face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than bancorp and the bank 
privacy 
the modernization act provides consumers with new protections against the transfer and use of their nonpublic personal information by financial institutions 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the federal reserve  the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of thrift supervision issued final rules on june  under the rules  financial institutions must provide among other things initial notices to customers about their privacy policies including a description of the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of such privacy policies to current customers  and subject to certain exceptions  a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosure to nonaffiliated third parties 
these federal privacy protections do not prohibit state governments from imposing more protective rules 
consumer protection rules sale of insurance products 
on december   the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies adopted consumer protection rules for the sale of insurance products by depository institutions as required by the modernization act 
the effective date was originally april   but on march   the federal agencies postponed the effective date until october  the rules apply to any depository institution or any person selling  soliciting  advertising  or offering insurance products or annuities to a customer at an office of the institution or on behalf of the institution 
the rule requires oral and written disclosure  before the completion of the sale of an insurance product or annuity  that such product is not a deposit or other obligation of  or guaranteed by  the depository institution or its affiliate  is not insured by the fdic or any other agency of the united states  the depository institution or its affiliates  and has certain risks of investment  including possible loss of value 
finally  the depository institution may not condition an extension of credit on the consumer s purchase of an insurance product or annuity from the depository institution or from any of its affiliates  on the consumer s agreement not to obtain an insurance product or annuity from an unaffiliated entity  or by prohibiting a consumer from obtaining an insurance product or annuity from an unaffiliated entity 
the disclosure must be understandable and the customer must acknowledge receipt of such disclosure 
in addition  to the extent practicable  a depository institution must keep insurance and annuity activities physically segregated from the areas where retail deposits are routinely accepted from the general public 
safeguarding confidential customer information 
in february  the federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies published guidelines requiring financial institutions to establish an information security program to identify and assess the risks that may threaten customer information  develop a written plan containing policies and procedures to manage and control these risks  implement and test the plan  and adjust the plan on a continuing basis to account for changes in technology  the sensitivity of customer information  and internal or external threats to information security 
each institution may implement a security program appropriate to its size and complexity and the nature and scope of its operations 
the guidelines outline specific security measures that institutions should consider in implementing a security program 
a financial institution must adopt those security measures determined to be appropriate 
the guidelines require the board of directors to oversee an institution s efforts to develop  implement  and maintain an effective information security program and approve written information security policies and programs 
the guidelines became effective july  the precise impact of the modernization act on bancorp and the bank will not be fully known until the last of the modernization act s phased effective dates occurs on november   and until regulatory agencies promulgate all the administrative regulations implementing many portions of the act 
it can be expected that state regulatory authorities and or legislatures may act in response to the modernization act 
usa patriot act on october   in response to the tragic events of september   president bush signed into law the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of the patriot act 
the patriot act is directed at the prevention  detection  and prosecution of international money laundering and financing of terrorism and  among other things  requires or will require financial institutions to do the following i establish an anti money laundering program  ii establish due diligence policies  procedures  and controls with respect to private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving foreign individuals and certain foreign banks  and iii avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the united states for  or on behalf of  foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country 
the company is not yet able to determine the impact of the patriot act on its financial condition or results of operations 
other banking regulations as a california state chartered commercial bank  the bank is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the fdic and by the california department of financial institutions 
the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the legal maximum and the bank is subject to fdic rules applicable to insured banks 
although not a member of the federal reserve  the bank is subject to federal and state rules and regulations 
capital requirements 
the federal reserve and the fdic have established risk based minimum capital guidelines that seek to ensure that banking organizations are appropriately capitalized 
the guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit or recourse arrangements 
under these guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and the credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjusted percentages 
the risk adjusted percentages range from for assets with low credit risk  such as us treasury securities  to for assets with high credit risk  such as commercial loans 
the federal regulators require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of to be well capitalized and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of to be well capitalized 
in addition  the federal regulators require a minimum tier leverage ratio of to be well capitalized 
the company was well capitalized as of december   with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and tier leverage ratio of 
the tables presenting our risk based capital and leverage ratios as of december   are included in note to the consolidated financial statements of bancorp  which are included in this annual report on form k 
prompt corrective action 
in december  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of or fdicia was enacted into law 
fdicia provided for the recapitalization of the bank insurance fund and improved examinations of insured depository institutions 
it required each federal banking regulatory agency to revise its risk based capital standards and to specify levels at which regulated institutions are considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
it prescribes standards for safety and soundness of all insured depository institutions 
fdicia requires each federal banking agency and the fdic to take prompt corrective action against those institutions that fail to satisfy their minimum capital requirements 
as of december   the bank was well capitalized for these regulatory purposes 
an institution that  based on its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category  if the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
the affected institution must receive proper notice and have an opportunity for a hearing 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions  including restrictions on the bank s activities  operational practices  and ability to pay dividends 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provision  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by federal regulators for  among other things  unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses  or violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the relevant regulatory agency or any written agreement with a regulatory agency 
premiums for deposit insurance 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured by the bank insurance fund  as administered by the fdic  up to the maximum permitted by law 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each bank insurance fund member institution is based on its capitalization risk level and its supervisory subgroup category 
the supervisory subgroup category is based on the fdic s assessment of the financial condition of the institution and the probability that fdic intervention or other corrective action will be required 
the bank insurance fund assessment rate as of december   ranged from zero to basis points per of insured deposits 
at december   the bank s assessment rate was zero 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semiannual basis 
an increase in the bank insurance fund assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance if it finds among other things that the institution s condition is unsafe or unsound  the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  and the institution has violated any applicable law  rule  regulation  order or condition imposed in writing by the relevant regulating agency or any written agreement with a regulating agency 
under the economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of  on january   banks began paying an annual assessment towards the retirement of us government issued financing corporation bonds 
the bonds were issued in the s to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
fdic insured institutions paid approximately cents per of bank insurance fund assessable deposits in dividends 
as a california corporation and a state chartered bank  the bank may not pay dividends to bancorp in excess of certain statutory and regulatory limits 
as of december   the maximum dividend that the bank could have declared  subject to regulatory approval  was  the california commissioner of financial institutions and the federal reserve may also prohibit a bank from paying dividends to its bank holding company if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  if the bank fails to comply with its minimum capital requirements  its regulators may restrict its ability to pay dividends using prompt corrective action or other enforcement powers 
community reinvestment act and fair lending 
the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving its home mortgage lending operations and community reinvestment act activities 
under the community reinvestment act  a bank is obligated to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound operation 
the community reinvestment act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs  nor does it limit a bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its community 
however  the community reinvestment act does require that federal regulators  when examining an institution  assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and take such record into account in evaluating certain applications  including an application to become a financial holding company under the modernization act 
federal regulators are required to provide a written examination of an institution s community reinvestment act performance 
the regulators rate an institution s performance using a four tiered rating system 
the ratings are outstanding record of meeting community credit needs  satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs  needs to improve record of meeting community credit needs  and substantial noncompliance of meeting community credit needs 
the ratings are available to the public 
based upon the last community reinvestment act examination by the fdic in january  the bank s community reinvestment act rating was satisfactory in meeting community credit needs 
the bank is also subject to other fair lending requirements and reporting obligations related to its home mortgage lending operations 
the equal credit opportunity act and fair housing act prohibit discrimination on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex or marital status  or age provided the applicant has the capacity to contract 
a bank can become subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for violations of fair lending laws 
federal limits on the activities and investments of state chartered banks 
federal restrictions on the direct and indirect activities and investments of state chartered or licensed depository institutions exist if the institution either carries federal deposit insurance or is involved in activities with foreign banks 
the fdic is the regulatory agency with the authority to determine federal restrictions on all direct and indirect activities and investments 
prior to  subject to a number of grandfathering provisions and a few exceptions  there were three rules which limited the activities and investments of state chartered banks 
a state chartered bank could not engage as principal in any type of activity that was prohibited for a national bank  unless the fdic determined the activity posed no significant risk to the affected deposit insurance fund and the institution met its fully phased in capital requirements 
a state chartered bank could not make or retain an equity investment of a type or in an amount that was prohibited for a national bank  and  divestiture of such an investment was required by a state chartered bank could retain an equity investment in the form of a majority owned subsidiary engaged as principal in activities prohibited for a national bank subsidiary  but only if the fdic had made the same determinations respecting risk to the insurance fund and capital compliance by the bank 
the modernization act added a new section to the federal deposit insurance act to provide that an insured state bank may control or hold an interest in a subsidiary engaged as principal in activities that would be permissible for a national bank to conduct through a financial subsidiary  subject to certain conditions 
under the modernization act  in january  the fdic adopted final rules to streamline the certification process 
state nonmember banks may self certify that they meet the requirements necessary to qualify for conducting non agency activities 
the insured state bank must certify that it is well managed  it is well capitalized  it will deduct the aggregate amount of its outstanding equity investment in all financial subsidiaries that engage in activities as principal from the bank s total assets and tangible equity  and it will deduct such equity investment in such financial subsidiaries from its total risk based capital 
in addition  the bank must have received a community reinvestment act rating of satisfactory in meeting community credit needs in its most recent examination 
additional requirements must be satisfied in order for a financial subsidiary of a state nonmember insured bank to conduct securities underwriting 
securities activities are subject to a variety of general and specific safety and soundness restrictions 
further  state banks wishing to engage in activities prohibited to national banks  such as real estate development or investment  must continue to seek fdic consent by filing a notice or application  as was the procedure before the modernization act 
interstate banking 
the federal riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of was signed into law on september  the riegle neal act significantly relaxed or eliminated many restrictions on interstate banking 
effective september   the riegle neal act permitted a bank holding company to acquire banks in states other than its home state  even if applicable state law would not permit that acquisition 
such acquisitions continue to require federal reserve approval and remain subject to certain state laws 
effective june   the riegle neal act permitted interstate mergers of banks  thereby allowing a single merged bank to operate branches in multiple states 
the riegle neal act allowed each state to adopt legislation to opt out of these interstate merger provisions 
conversely  the riegle neal act permitted states to opt in to the merger provisions of the act prior to their stated effective date  to permit interstate mergers in that state prior to june  the enactment of the california interstate banking and branching act of provided for interstate banking and branching in california 
this early opt in legislation became effective on october  it required out of state institutions  which did not own a california bank to acquire an existing whole five year old bank before establishing a california branch 
de novo interstate branching was not permitted 
this act revised much of the original california interstate banking law first enacted in that permitted interstate banking with other states on a reciprocal basis 
banks and bank holding companies contemplating acquisitions must comply with the following acts  as applicable the competitive standards of the bank holding company act  the change in bank control act  and the bank merger act 
the crucial test under each act is whether the proposed acquisition will result in a monopoly or will substantially lessen competition in the relevant geographic market 
both the bank holding company act and the bank merger act preclude granting regulatory approval for any transaction that will result in a monopoly or is in furtherance of a plan to create a monopoly 
however  where a proposed transaction is likely to cause a substantial reduction in competition  or tends to create a monopoly or otherwise restrain trade  these acts permit the granting of regulatory approval under certain circumstances 
the applicable regulator may approve the transaction if it concludes that the perceived anti competitive effects are clearly outweighed by the probable beneficial effects of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
we seek to expand our market areas by acquiring other financial institutions or establishing de novo branches in or outside of california as permitted by applicable laws  whenever suitable opportunities present themselves 
the riegle neal act may have the effect of increasing competition by facilitating entry into the california banking market by out of state banks and bank holding companies

during  the federal open market committee fomc  lowered the target federal funds rate by basis points in rapid succession during the year 
in november  an additional reduction of basis points was approved by the fomc  bringing the total decrease to basis points during the past two years 
as a commercial bank  most of our loans are variable rate  and reprice each time there is a change in the target federal funds rate 
in response to these conditions  we made efforts to manage our interest earning assets by increasing average loans  which yield higher than other types of investments  and made efforts to obtain lower cost core deposits  thus optimizing the mix of our deposit portfolios 
the impact of these efforts allowed us to maintain our taxable equivalent margin well above the mark during  and increased our taxable equivalent net interest income by million to million compared with million for on a combined basis  these changes to our balance sheet should position us to slightly reduce our exposure to declining interest rates  while also effectively allowing us to take advantage of market interest rates in the event they move upward 
the increase of million to taxable equivalent interest income was due to a combination of the following increase in volume average interest earning assets increased million  to billion in  an increase of over interest earning assets of billion in the increase in total interest earning assets contributed an additional million to taxable equivalent interest income between and decrease in rate as mentioned above  the rapidly declining interest rate environment was the main factor behind our decrease in taxable equivalent interest income in  resulting in a million decrease to taxable equivalent interest income due to rate changes

the million decrease in taxable equivalent interest income was due to a combination of the following increase in volume average interest earning assets increased million  to billion in  an increase of over interest earning assets of billion in the increase in volume was primarily attributable to the increase in average net loans of million  which contributed an additional million to interest income

the bank deposits are generally obtained from residents within the bank s geographic market area 
the bank utilizes traditional marketing methods to attract new customers and deposits  by offering a wide variety of products and services and utilizing various forms of advertising media 
although the bank s vast majority of the bank s deposits are retail in nature  the bank does engage in certain wholesale activities  primarily accepting time deposits from political subdivisions and public agencies 
the bank considers wholesale deposits to be an alternative borrowing source rather than a customer relationship  and as such  their levels are determined by management s decisions as to the most economic funding sources 
at december   the bank had no brokered deposits  and public deposits totaled million or of total deposits 
the bank s total deposits increased million or from billion at year end to billion at december  core deposits increased million or

the following table displays average deposits and rates for the past five years average deposits and rates amount amount amount amount amount dollars in thousands demand now accounts money market accounts savings deposits time deposits total as interest rate spreads broadened between jumbo cds and other types of interest bearing deposits under the prevailing interest rate environment  our jumbo cd portfolio maintained faster growth than other types of deposits 
nevertheless  management considers our jumbo cds generally less volatile primarily due to the following reasons approximately of the bank s jumbo cds have stayed with the bank for more than two years  the jumbo cd portfolio continued to be diversified with  individual accounts averaging approximately  per account owned by  individual depositors as of january   and this phenomenon of having a relatively higher percentage of jumbo cds to total deposits exists in most of the asian american banks in our california market due to the fact that the customers in this market tend to have a higher savings rate 
management continues to monitor the jumbo cd portfolio to identify any changes in the deposit behavior in the market and of the patrons the bank is servicing 
to discourage the concentration in jumbo cds  management has continued to make efforts in the following areas to offer only retail interest rates on jumbo cds  to offer new transaction based products  such as the tiered money market deposits  to promote transaction based products from time to time  such as demand deposits  and to seek to diversify the customer base by branch expansion and or acquisition as opportunities arise 
almost of our jumbo cds mature within one year as of year end the following tables display time deposits of  or more by maturity and time deposits with remaining term of more than one year at december  time deposits of  or more by maturity at december  in thousands less than three months three to six months six to twelve months over one year total maturities of time deposits with a remaining term of more than one year for each of the five years following december  in thousands borrowings borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase reverse repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  and funds obtained as advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco

stockholders equity of million was up million or compared to million at december  our stockholders equity equaled of total assets at december   compared of total assets at year end the increase of million or in stockholders equity was due to the following an addition of million from net income less payments of dividends on common stock of million  an increase of million from issuance of additional common shares through the dividend reinvestment plan and proceeds from exercise of stock options less the purchase of  shares of treasury stock during  at an average price of  totaling  an increase of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  including a favorable difference of million in the net unrealized holding gains on securities available for sale  net of tax  and an increase of  from unrealized gains on cash flow hedging derivatives  net of tax

the company intends to repurchase shares under the program  from time to time  in the open market or through negotiated purchases  under conditions which allow such repurchases to be accretive to earnings  while maintaining capital ratios that exceed the guidelines for a well capitalized financial institution

management seeks to retain the company s capital at a level sufficient to support future growth  to protect depositors and stockholders  to absorb any unanticipated losses and to comply with various regulatory requirements 
under california state banking law  the bank may not pay a cash dividend  without regulatory approval  which exceeds the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or its net income for the last three fiscal years  less any cash distributions made during that period 
the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends as of december   is restricted to approximately  under this regulation 
capital adequacy management seeks to retain the company s capital at a level sufficient to support future growth  protect depositors and stockholders  and comply with various regulatory requirements 
the primary measure of capital adequacy is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets 
at year end  tier risk based capital ratio of  total risk based capital ratio of  and tier leverage capital ratio of  continued to place the company in the well capitalized category  which is defined as institutions with tier risk based capital ratio equal to or greater than six percent  tier leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than five percent  and total risk based capital ratio equal to or greater than ten percent 
the comparable ratios for were tier risk based capital ratio of  total risk based capital ratio of  and tier leverage capital ratio of 
a table displaying the company and the bank s capital and leverage ratios at year end and is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and other real estate owned 
the company s policy is to place loans on a non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any interest accrued in the previous three months is generally reversed against current income 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements 
such loans are placed under closer supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
our non performing assets decreased million or to million at year end compared to million at year end the decrease was due to a combination of the following an increase of million in loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  a decrease of million in non accrual loans  and a decrease of  in other real estate owned 
as a percentage of gross loans plus other real estate owned  our non performing assets decreased to at year end from at year end the non performing loan coverage ratio  defined as the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans  increased to at year end  which was higher than that of at year end the increase was primarily due to the reduction of million in non accrual loans 
on january   one accruing commercial mortgage loan past due days or more  in the amount of million was paid off  and on january   one non accrual construction loan in the amount of million was paid off

commercial non accrual loans ucc filings  mainly accounts receivable and inventories  secured five loans totaling  the balance of million consisted of six credits secured primarily by first trust deeds on multi family residences or commercial buildings and warehouses  and one unsecured credit 
troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when the lender  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower 
the concessions may be granted in various forms  including reduction in the stated interest rate  reduction in the loan balance or accrued interest  and extension of the maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings  including those on non accrual status  increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  at december   all trouble debt restructured loans were performing under their revised terms  except for two credits totaling million  which were not delinquent  but management choose to placed both credits on non accrual status  due to credit concerns 
these two credits are included with other non accrual loans 
the increase from year end was primarily due two credits totaling million that were restructured during the year  partially offset by credits that paid off during the year or were performing for an extended period of time and removed from troubled debt restructured classification 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on current circumstances and events 
we consider all loans classified and restructured in our evaluation of loan impairment 
the classified loans are stratified by size  and loans less than our defined selection criteria are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
we identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of million at year end  compared to million at year end the average balance of impaired loans was million in and million in interest collected on impaired loans totaled million in  and  in on january   one impaired construction loan on non accrual status  with a recorded investment of million  was paid off

in addition  accruing loans past due days or more had an outstanding balance of million at year end compared with  at year end on january   one accruing commercial mortgage loan past due days or more  with a recorded investment of million  was paid off 
loan concentration we experienced no loan concentrations to multiple borrowers in similar activities which exceeded of total loans as of december  see factors that may affect future results below for a discussion of some of the factors that may affect the matters discussed in this section 
allowance for loan losses the bank s management is committed to managing the risk in its loan portfolio by maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered to be equal to the estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
with a risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for loan losses in a timely manner 
in addition  our board of directors has established a written loan policy that includes an effective loan review and control system to ensure that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and judge that it is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the amounts of the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for loan losses are increased by charges to the provision for loan losses 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
a sustained weakness or further weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
see factors that may affect future results  in this annual report on form k  for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance

our allowance for loan losses consists of the following specific allowance for impaired loans  we provide specific allowances based on an evaluation of impairment  and for each criticized loan  we allocate a portion of the general allowance to each loan based on a loss percentage assigned 
the percentage assigned depends on a number of factors including loan classification  the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio and general economic conditions 
general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and by identifying risk characteristics that are common to the groups of loans 
the allowance is provided to each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience  the trends in delinquency  and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as national and local economy  trends and conditions  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards and the concentration of credit 
the total allowance for loan losses consists of the above two components specific and general 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these above methodologies  the specific allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the table set forth below reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of percentage of loans in each loans in each loans in each loans in each loans in each category category category category category to average to average to average to average to average amount gross loans amount gross loans amount gross loans amount gross loans amount gross loans dollars in thousands type of loans commercial loans residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans total total commercial loans have grown from million at year end to million at year end  with the large portion of this growth being in asset based lending category  including the issuance of letters of credit through the bank s international department 
while this segment has been steadily growing with the exception of the first quarter of  the growth rate has been slower during the fourth quarter with a continued sluggish economic recovery as evidenced by an million increase during the fourth quarter of compared with million growth during the third quarter of delinquencies over days in this segment correspondingly peaked in the fourth quarter of  at million  before trending downward to million by year end  as the growth rate subsided 
allocated allowances increased slightly from million at year end  to million at year end  after applying loan charge offs of million during however  in view of the recent losses experienced by the bank in the asset based lending category  management has deemed it prudent to increase the minimum loss rate allocation to as compared to the on september   since there is a certain degree of continued economic sluggishness and uncertainty in the direction of the economy 
residential mortgage loans decreased to million at december   from million at year end  after rising to million at september   based on a growth level in originations  and based on usually low interest rates during the third quarter and fourth quarter from rate sensitive borrowers 
while delinquencies over days have been trending downward from the fourth quarter of  rising unemployment in a sluggish early stage economic recovery in the fourth quarter of  has caused a corresponding million rise in delinquency in the fourth quarter of  compared with  at the end of the third quarter even though actual charge offs have not occurred in this segment over the last year  management has nevertheless determined that it is prudent to allocate an allowance for million at year end in this loan category  in view of the current origination volume and the rise in credit risks associated with increases in unemployment during a sluggish recovery in the economy 
commercial mortgage loans grew or million during while the allowance allocation increased  or approximately to a level of million from million in most of the growth in this loan segment during took place in the third and fourth quarters  and was primarily a direct result of unusually low interest rates to rate sensitive borrowers 
although the volume has increased  there has been no concentration of hotels or motels  but has consisted primarily of shopping centers  commercial office buildings  warehouses  apartment structures  and represents approximately of the bank s gross loans 
delinquencies over days in this loan segment have ranged from a high of million in the first quarter of  to a low of million in the second quarter of  with an average delinquent amount of million 
total delinquency in this segment rose to million in the fourth quarter  but was below the year end total of million 
within this delinquency aggregate  day delinquent accounts have fallen from million at march   to  at december   a substantial decrease  while non accrual loans have also decreased from  at year end  to  by the end of loan losses have been nominal during the last nine quarters despite the variance in delinquencies 
however  management expects that the debt service capability of borrowers during will depend to some degree on the direction of the economy  which  thus far  has shown only a gradual recovery from the recent recession 
because of the increased volume in this loan segment coupled with a sluggish recovery  and an uncertain degree of impact on the real estate variables such as appreciation  rate sensitivity  debt service capability  and long term profitability that drive these types of loans  management has reached the conclusion to increase the allowance in this segment by a prevailing minimum risk factor allocation rate 
unlike the commercial mortgage loans  the outstanding construction loans have continued to decrease in  and as of the fourth quarter the balance of this segment was million compared to million at year end delinquency over days in this segment has correspondingly decreased from million at year end  to million by the fourth quarter  with the reduction in loan volume and the resolution of two of four major delinquent loans 
non accrual loans also moved downward from the level of million to million 
however  even though the loan volume and delinquency have decreased  the allocated allowances have remained approximately million for the last two consecutive quarters of while the allowance has decreased from the first quarter of  the bank believes it to be prudent to hold the present level of allocation based on the inherent risk nature in this loan segment 
more specifically  the primary rationale by the bank s management for not correspondingly decreasing the allowances as of year end in this loan segment is based upon the longer term higher risk nature of construction projects that have the potential of exceeding the projected interest reserves 
thus far  management has not observed borrowers encountering above normal difficulty in obtaining permanent takeout financing  sizable concentration of commercial office building loans  and an increased number of extensions to the borrower for completion of construction 
management believes that the risk allocation for the construction portfolio should be viewed from a longer economic view given the current weak leasing market for office buildings in southern and northern california 
allocated allowances for installment and consumer loans have been gradually declining as the total loan volume in this segment has declined from million at year end to million at year end the bank has not actively competed for this type of loan  but has provided such loans  when necessary  as an accommodation to bank customers 
delinquencies over days have moved downward nominally from  at year end to  at year end loans delinquent over days have been eliminated for the last two quarters of loans on non accrual have been nominal throughout and similarly  the charged off loans have also been nominal with the decreasing loan volume 
management has therefore correspondingly continued to move the allocated allowances downward with the decrease in loan volume from  at year end to the present level of  at year end allowances for other risks of probable loan losses that amounted to million as of december   compared to million as of december  have been included in the allocations above 
the components of the other risks that have a potential of affecting the bank s portfolio are comprised of two basic elements 
first  the bank has set aside funds to cover the risk factors of a recessionary state of the national economy and the uncertain economic forecast in the short run 
thus far  the government s efforts to stimulate the economy through various monetary policies such as tax cuts and aggressive lowering of interest rates over the last one and three quarter years have only resulted in the early stage of a sluggishly uncertain recovery as evidenced by eroding consumer confidence  weak demand for non durables  and the lack of business investment 
the september th event and the current corporate scandals in various large companies and discussions of probable war against iraq have clouded the economic outlook instead of giving clear visibility to the direction of the economy 
the economy could experience a second downturn and companies will not be able to avoid further substantial short falls in sales and earnings  business closures and downsizing  which will result in increased risk to the bank s portfolio 
the second component of other portfolio risk is the potential errors in loan classification and review methodologies 
based on these two above components of other risks  management has increased the allocation of the allowance

liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and advances from fhlb 
at year end  our liquidity ratio defined as net cash  short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities decreased slightly to  compared to at year end to supplement its liquidity needs  the bank maintains a total credit line of million for federal funds with three correspondent banks  and master agreements with six brokerage firms whereby up to million would be available through the sale of securities subject to repurchase 
the bank is also a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had a total approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling million 
the total credit outstanding with the fhlb of san francisco at december   was million 
these advances are non callable and bear fixed interest rates  with million maturing in  million maturing in  and million maturing in these borrowings are secured by residential mortgages 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities available for sale 
at december   such assets at fair value totaled million  with million pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining million was available as additional liquidity  of which was afs securities  available to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
we had a significant portion of our time deposits maturing within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will be minimal and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity to the bank to meet its daily operating needs 
the bancorp obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank and proceeds from investments in the dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations 
the business activities of bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank with limited activities in other investments 
management believes bancorp s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources are sufficient to meet its operational needs

factors that may affect future results the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of estimable and probable loan losses 
actual loan losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our net income and capital 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the estimable and probable losses from our loan portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our net income and capital 
such excess could also lead to larger allowances for loan losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect net income and capital in those periods 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate to cover estimable and probable losses from its loan portfolio as of that date 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our loans  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain loan losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for loan losses 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our business 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 
generally  the interest rates on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the company do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of repricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
see also risks elements of the loan portfolio and market risk 
inflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
we began this expansion with the acquisition of certain assets and assumptions of certain liabilities from golden city commercial bank in new york in and the opening of the houston loan production office in texas  which was subsequently converted into a full service branch in in addition  on october   we opened a new branch in union city  northern california 
in  we opened a new branch in brooklyn  new york city  and one in sacramento  california 
in addition  with china s accession into the world trade organization and its increasing importance in the world economy  we opened a representative office in shanghai  china 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business  if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
the company could be adversely affected by potential changes in california tax law and delays in implementation of its strategy 
our effective income tax rate was lower in   and due in large part to income tax benefits derived from a registered investment company subsidiary of the bank 
we had relied on the california tax law related to registered investment companies and on an outside tax opinion 
in january  a change to that law was proposed that would have denied these tax benefits retroactively for the earlier years  as well as prospectively for future years 
this proposed change was not enacted  but another proposal was recently introduced in the california legislature  which would deny such tax benefits from and after january  in december   we decided to deregister the registered investment company and  in january   we applied to the securities and exchange commission for such deregistration 
also in january   as an alternative to the registered investment company  we applied for regulatory approval to create a real estate investment trust 
we received such regulatory approval in february   and have started operating the real estate investment trust and building up its assets 
while the real estate investment trust should provide some tax benefits in  our effective income tax rate for is expected to be higher than the rate in the past few years 
the actual rate for will depend to some extent on the timing of the build up in the asset levels of the trust  as well as on the interest rate and regulatory environment 
adverse economic conditions in california and other regions where the bank has operations  could cause us to incur losses 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in southern and northern california  and secondarily in nevada  texas  and new york 
adverse economic conditions in these regions could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral  such as  the currently unknown impact of the california budged deficit 
these events could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us 
real estate securing our lending activities is also principally located in southern and northern california  and to a lesser extent  in houston  texas  and new york city 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  acts of nature including earthquakes  flood and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the risks inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
the risk inherent in construction lending may adversely affect our net income 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction  which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction  and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
such consideration can affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not insure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan on or secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of such property 
however  the appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits and loans  as well as other banking services  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
such banks and financial institutions have greater resources than us  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than us and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  brokerage houses  credit unions and non financial institutions 
adverse effects of banking regulations or changes in banking regulations could adversely affect our business 
we are governed by significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers and not for the benefit of our stockholders 
in the past  our business has been materially affected by such regulation and supervision 
this trend is likely to continue in the future 
laws  regulations  or policies currently affecting us may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of existing laws and regulations 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on commercial banking in general or on our business in particular 
adverse economic conditions in asia could cause us to incur losses 
it is difficult to predict the behavior of the asian economy 
the us economic policies  military tensions  and an unfavorable global economic condition may adversely impact the asian economy 
if the asian economic conditions should deteriorate  we could be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by our asian american customers 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of companies operating in this region 
statutory restrictions on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us 
a substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before we  as a holder of an equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
our need to continue to adapt to our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we begin to offer internet banking and other on line services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws and rights agreement could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement between us and american stock transfer and trust company  as rights agent  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  preferred share purchase rights that generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
terrorist attacks 
the impact of september th terrorist attacks or any future terrorist attacks and responses to such activities cannot be predicted at this time with respect to severity or duration 
the impact could adversely affect the company in a number of ways  including  among others  an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not reprice at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the repricing characteristics of our loans  securities  and deposits on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use both an interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability or the market value of our assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis details the expected maturity and repricing opportunities  mismatch or sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities over a specified time frame 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets which reprice over a given time period exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
during periods of increasing interest rates  net interest margin may be enhanced with a positive gap 
a negative gap exists when rate sensitive liabilities which reprice over a given time period exceed rate sensitive assets 
during periods of increasing interest rates  net interest margin may be impaired with a negative gap 
the following table indicates the maturity or repricing and rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  our exposure as reflected in the table  represents the estimated difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing during future periods based on certain assumptions 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities presented in the table may vary if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
as reflected in the table below  we were asset sensitive with a cumulative gap ratio of a positive within three months and within one year at year end  compared with a positive within three months and a negative within one year at year end interest rate sensitivity december  interest rate sensitivity period within over months over year over non interest months to year to years years sensitive total dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and due from banks federal funds sold securities available for sale securities held to maturity loans receivable commercial loans residential mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans total loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits demand money market and now savings tcds under tcds and over total deposits december  interest rate sensitivity period within over months over year over non interest months to year to years years sensitive total dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from federal home loan bank non interest bearing other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap gap ratio of total assets cumulative gap ratio loans are gross of the allowance for loan losses and unamortized deferred loan fees 
non accrual loans are included in non earning assets 
adjustable loans are included in the within three months category  as they are subject to an interest adjustment depending upon terms on the loan 
the company s own historical experience and decay factor are used to estimate the money market and now  and savings deposit runoff 
since interest rate sensitivity analysis does not measure the timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the company s traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
the company s simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would decrease by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our assets and liabilities would increase by 
quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  and the instruments fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

however  the company enters into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in the company s assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  the company may protect its position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
for periods prior to january   for those qualifying financial derivatives that altered the interest rate characteristics of assets or liabilities  the net differential to be paid or received on the financial derivative was treated as an adjustment to the yield on the underlying assets or liabilities 
interest rate financial derivatives that did not qualify for the accrual method  were recorded at fair value  with gains and losses recorded in earnings 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and no 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in the company s statement of financial condition and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
the company uses financial derivatives designated for hedging activities as cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution in the notional amount of million for a period of five years 
the interest rate swap was for the purpose of hedging the cash flows from a portion of our floating rate loans against declining interest rates 
the purpose of the hedge is to provide a measure of stability in the future cash receipts from such loans over the term of the swap agreement  which at december   was approximately nine quarters 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million  exclusive of accrued interest  or million net of tax compared to million  exclusive of accrued interest  or  net of tax  at december  for the twelve months ended december   net amounts totaling million were reclassified into earnings 
the estimated net amount of the existing gains within accumulated other comprehensive income that are expected to reclassify into earnings within the next months is approximately million
