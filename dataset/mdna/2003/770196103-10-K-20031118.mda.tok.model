item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the pharmaceutical  energy and industrial markets worldwide 
in our estimation our principal brand names pfaudler  moyno  chemineer  laetus  frymakoruma  siebler  hapa and hercules hold the number one or two market share position in the niche markets they serve 
we operate with three market focused business segments pharmaceutical  energy and industrial 
during the past five years  our strategy has been to increase our focus on high growth markets  such as pharmaceutical and energy  and to broaden our international presence 
in furtherance of this strategy  on august   we acquired romaco  a european based manufacturer of processing  dosing  filling  printing and security equipment for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries 
our acquisition of romaco  which had sales of approximately million in our fiscal  expands the breadth of our pharmaceutical capabilities and positions us as a leading supplier of primary and secondary processing equipment to the growing pharmaceutical market 
with the addition of romaco  our international sales increased to approximately of fiscal sales from of our fiscal sales 
the total purchase price of romaco was million 
at closing in fiscal  we paid consideration of million as follows million in cash  million in a five year subordinated note  the assumption of net debt of million and  of our common shares valued at million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we made an additional payment based on romaco s sales and operating performance for calendar year of million  half of which was in cash and half of which was in a five year subordinated note 
we also incurred acquisition costs of million in fiscal we completed the romaco acquisition as of the end of fiscal  therefore  the acquisition had no impact on our results of operations in fiscal pro forma result references throughout this discussion give effect to the romaco acquisition as if it were made at the beginning of fiscal in our industrial segment  we will pursue strategic acquisitions if cost structure can be improved or market share protected 
on november   we purchased the stock of tarby  inc tarby for million 
tarby is a manufacturer and marketer of progressive cavity pumps and components for the general industrial and municipal wastewater markets 
included in our fiscal operating results are sales of million and ebit of million from tarby since the date of acquisition 

table of contents results of operations the following tables present components of our consolidated income statement and segment information 
consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit sg a expenses amortization other ebit by segment in thousands  except percents pharmaceutical sales ebit ebit energy sales ebit ebit industrial sales ebit ebit total sales ebit ebit fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million  an increase of million or over the prior fiscal year 
the impact of exchange rates  the translation of sales from non us operations into non us dollars  accounted for million of sales 
the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a volume decrease of million 
the decline in sales volumes is in both our romaco and reactor systems units and is due to weak market conditions in europe 
the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  an increase of million  or 
most of this increase in sales has occurred in the last quarter of our fiscal year and is due to higher rig counts as a result of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and increased sales in venezuela 
the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
our acquisition of tarby on november   accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase is a result of an improving industrial economic environment in north america in the latter part of our fiscal year 
ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal 
table of contents the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decline of million 
of this decrease  million related to the aforementioned sales volume decrease of million  excluding the impact of exchange rates  with the remainder of the decline due to lower pricing in europe for glass lined reactor vessels 
the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
two thirds of this increased ebit is a result of higher sales volumes  with the remaining increase coming from cost reduction programs implemented in fiscal that were fully realized in fiscal the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the tarby acquisition accounted for million of this increase 
the remaining increase in ebit is due to slightly higher sales volumes and cost saving measures undertaken in fiscal that were realized in fiscal interest expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to lower average debt levels resulting from cash flow generated in fiscal and our secondary stock offering in june of fiscal that raised net proceeds of million 
our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the lower net income is a result of the items mentioned above  and the relatively larger decline in net income per share is a result of having million more average common shares outstanding as a result of the secondary stock offering in june of fiscal fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  sales for fiscal were million compared with million in the same period of the prior year 
on a pro forma basis  taking into account the romaco acquisition  sales decreased million  or the pharmaceutical segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal on a pro forma basis  the pharmaceutical segment sales increased million  or 
overall  this sales increase was due to the strengthening of the euro against the dollar 
romaco s sales increased by million compared with their pro forma fiscal sales due to the strength of the pharmaceutical and healthcare markets 
however  offsetting this was decreased reactor systems sales of million 
the decline in reactor systems sales was due to the impact of the weak specialty chemical market and slow industrial economy in the us the energy segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in the same period of fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
lower crude oil and natural gas prices caused a reduction in exploration and production activities in fiscal compared with fiscal the industrial segment had sales of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
this segment was also negatively impacted by the slow industrial economy in the us ebit in fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required that goodwill no longer be amortized 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a million reduction in amortization in fiscal in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal  we consolidated operations in england  mexico and the asia pacific region to strengthen our market presence and achieve more effective channels to market 
we also discontinued certain product offerings in our chemineer and moyno businesses to improve our long term competitive position through a more cost effective product focus 
we incurred a charge of million  million of which related to severance and other costs associated with the regional consolidations and the balance of which related to inventory write downs from discontinued product offerings 
there were additional costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal totalling million that we expensed as incurred primarily for equipment 
table of contents relocation  marketing and employee training 
as of august   we had paid all costs related to the global reorganization program without any changes in estimates 
the pharmaceutical segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal on a pro forma basis  the pharmaceutical segment ebit in fiscal increased by million over the prior year period 
the increase in ebit in is due to lower amortization of million and global reorganization costs recorded in fiscal of 
million 
the energy segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in energy segment sales reduced ebit by million 
in addition  there were increased research and development costs and a change in sales mix from higher margin exploration products to lower margin wellhead products 
offsetting these items was lower amortization in fiscal of million 
the industrial segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  a reduction of million  while sales decreased by million 
the industrial segment had lower amortization in fiscal of million  and global reorganization costs recorded in fiscal were million 
therefore  the decrease in fiscal ebit excluding these items was million 
the reduction was due to lower overall sales volumes and reduced selling prices resulting from the weak markets into which this segment sells 
ebit was also negatively impacted by the mix of products sold as the volume of high margin industrial pump aftermarket products declined significantly 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was due to higher average debt levels resulting from the acquisition of romaco 
our effective interest rate was in fiscal and in fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared with in fiscal net deferred income tax assets of million at august  primarily related to us operations 
net income and net income per diluted share in fiscal were million and compared with million and in fiscal the decrease was due to the weak market conditions and resulting lower sales volumes in the energy and industrial segments in fiscal interest costs were also higher due to debt incurred for the romaco acquisition  however  overall the romaco acquisition was accretive 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operations was million compared with million in fiscal the continued strong cash flow from operations was due to our actions to conserve cash in reaction to the weak economic environment 
because of these actions  working capital was reduced by million in fiscal  excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates 
we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund the fiscal year operating needs  scheduled debt services  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures of approximately million 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  cost reductions and replacement items 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal we also paid million to purchase the stock of tarby in fiscal financing activities on february   in a non cash transaction we exchanged million of existing convertible subordinated notes due for an equal amount of convertible subordinated notes due the convertible subordinated notes are convertible into our common shares at per share 
on april   we redeemed the remaining million of convertible subordinated 
table of contents notes 
the redemption price was of the principal amount 
we used proceeds from our revolving credit loan to pay for the redemption 
on october   we entered into an amended credit agreement 
under this agreement  which provides for borrowings on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million  there was million in outstanding indebtedness at october   and of the remaining capacity  million was available for borrowing under the applicable financial covenants 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty accruals  litigation  product liability  environmental accruals and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
retirement benefit obligations are affected by a number of estimates made by us in consultation with independent actuaries  including  the discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets and assumed increases for wage rate and health care costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents goodwill as of september   we adopted two new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
sfas no 
 business combinations  eliminated the pooling method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   and addressed the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
accordingly  we applied the provisions of sfas no 
to all business combinations initiated after june  we also adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september  goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption of the standard  and the required impairment tests were performed 
results of these impairment tests have not generated any impairment loss to date 
goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  are performed at the end of our first quarter 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation were applied to guarantees issued or modified after december  effective december   we adopted financial interpretation no 
and it did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we continue to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
for the method used to account for stock based employee compensation arrangements  where applicable  but have adopted the new disclosure requirements of sfas see note 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the adoption of financial interpretation no 
had no effect on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and over foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit and cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million and million  respectively 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
at august   we had entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million was at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million 
the following table presents the aggregate maturities and related weighted average interest rates of our debt obligations at august  by maturity dates
