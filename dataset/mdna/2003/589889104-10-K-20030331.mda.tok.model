item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview year was merit s most successful year in merit s history in terms of revenue and profitability 
not only did the company s revenues grow by during  but virtually every area of the company s financial performance improved in  including net income  which increased over the year ended december  previously the year in which the company had achieved its highest level of net income 
merit experienced continued record growth and improvements in the company s productivity increased to over  of sales per employee for the year ended december   up from just three years ago 
from january to december  the company s revenues increased over and the company introduced new products  while decreasing inventory by more than 
the reduction in inventory and the higher employee productivity  along with merit s upgraded mis systems and new incentive pay system  worked together to make the company much more productive 
the productivity gains are especially evident in the gross margin improvements 
gross margins as a percentage of sales improved basis points during the year ended december  the improvement in the company s financial condition is reflected by the recent retirement of the company s long term and short term debt 
since august the month in which the company s long term debt reached its highest point  the company paid off million in long term debt in just months 
since march  the company s line of credit has been paid in full  and in the months since  the company has paid cash for all its capital investments including the purchase of the facility and land in galway  ireland and accumulated almost million in cash 
all of these accomplishments have contributed to a record year for merit 
higher employee productivity resulted in part from a company wide incentive pay program that compensates each employee for achievement of individual  team and or company goals  the benefit from which the company shares with its employees 
the company s new oracle system  with which the company s employees are now experienced  has contributed to the company s increased productivity 
rising from the company s struggles during  management is continuing to leverage long term investments in product breadth  quality and innovation direct sales forces in the united states and europe and quality systems and facilities 
with the company s cash flow improving and its debt paid off as of february   the company had retired all of its long term debt  merit is positioned to take advantage of many opportunities now becoming available to the company 
merit recently added to its product line several products developed outside the company because management believes that the company s marketing and sales capabilities are the best vehicle for those products to get the focused exposure they need 
management believes there are many more opportunities for growth within the company in addition to the continued growth of the market in which the company s products are sold 
furthermore  management believes market acceptance of the company s new and existing products  particularly newly acquired products  technologies and or businesses  if achieved  will further enhance and leverage the position merit has attained 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development income from operations income before income tax expense 
net income 
sales increased by million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in  and an increase of million  or  in the increase in sales for resulted primarily from a increase in custom kit revenues  a increase in stand alone products revenues  an increase in inflation device revenues  and increase catheter product revenues 
the company s revenues increased notwithstanding the fact that the markets for many of the company s products are experiencing slight pricing declines  therefore substantially all of the increase in revenues was attributable to increased unit sales 
sales growth from through was also favorably affected by the introduction of new products and increased sales of existing products sold separately and packaged in custom kits  and increased penetration of the market by merit s inflation devices 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  compared to million  or of total sales  in  and million  or of total sales  in these increases were primarily a result of the addition of the angleton product lines and ongoing growth in european direct sales  as well as greater acceptance of the company s products in other international markets 
direct sales in france  germany  the uk  belgium  the netherlands and ireland were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was   and in   and  respectively 
the increase in the gross margin percentage in over was due primarily to increased efficiency and productivity gains achieved by the operations group in the company s utah facilities 
a lower head count in both direct labor and overhead areas of production contributed to higher efficiency and productivity 
the company has also reduced the material costs from many of its principal vendors 
management presently anticipates that the company will be able to improve upon the level of gross margins achieved during  as demonstrated by the gross margin reported by the company for the fourth quarter of the company is operating in a generally declining price market 
there is also a general cost increasing manufacturing environment 
merit has been able to battle this difficult situation with ever increasing production volumes until beginning in early  the company suffered through the implementation of a comprehensive new software system  which led to difficulties in efficiently operating the purchasing  planning and manufacturing processes of the business 
merit also made a purposeful effort to increase its safety stock levels of inventory in preparation for higher  anticipated sales orders ahead of yk 
the combination of these increased production demands created a build up of capacity in labor and overhead 
as the end of approached  however  the company needed to reduce production levels to match cash flow expectations 
the reduced production volumes created higher overhead costs per unit  lower gross margins  and lower bottom line results 
another important factor negatively affecting gross margins was the large drop in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar during  which reduced revenues and gross profit of the european operation by million and reduced overall gross margins by 
in december  the company began the difficult process of downsizing the labor and overhead capacities in the operation of its utah facilities 
the company eliminated the large excess negative production variances that were caused by the slowdown in production volumes 
this result was accomplished by the attrition of approximately people from its high point in december of  or an average reduction of people in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in over and 
million  or  in over these additional expenditures were related principally to increased costs of expanding the direct sales force market  marketing support and their management both in the united states and europe 
another important factor in the increase from to was expenses associated with the development of new business opportunities such as acquisitions  product distribution agreements  national accounts and the oem portion of merit s business 
these increases in costs have caused selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to increase to in from in research and development expenses for were million  a decrease of  compared to million for  an increase of compared to million in r d expenses declined during as a result of the completion of r d activities in ireland relating to the company s guide wire product line and the transition of much of the r d resources to manufacturing of the new diagnostic guide wire product line 
most of the increase from to was due to an increase of the r d capabilities in galway  ireland  with the company s developing guide wire technology 
research and development costs as a percentage of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
management believes that the development of to projects at any given time is an appropriate level of r d for the company  and is likely to provide to new products a year through r d  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales introduction 
in  higher sales  better gross margins and lower research costs per dollar of sales combined to increase income from operations up  income before tax up  and net income up to record levels  compared to the effective tax rate for was  up slightly from in  mostly because the foreign sales corporation and r d tax benefits were diluted by a increase in income before taxes 
in  significantly lower margins more than offset the gains in sales as well as the reduction in sg a and r d expenses  the net effect of which was income from operations of million 
the income tax benefit for was  an effective rate of 
this negative tax rate was due principally to r d tax credits which the company was able to realize in the fourth quarter of  including a portion of which related to prior years 
management expects the effective tax rate for to rise substantially to as much as due to a higher incremental tax rate  further dilution and some reduction in the foreign sales and r d tax benefits

critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in their md a 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required

 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and intends to continue to do so 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock compensation arrangements 
if the compensation cost for the company s compensation plans had been determined consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the value of the us dollar 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and the company s principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of the company s revenues in million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues came from sales that were denominated in euros 
certain of the company s expenses are also denominated in euros  partially offsetting any risk associated with fluctuations of the euro dollar exchange rate 
because of the company s euro denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which the company s euro denominated revenues exceed its euro based expenses  the value of such euro denominated net income increases if the value of the euro increases relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro decreases relative to the value of the united states 
for example  in  a drop in the value of the euro in relation to the us dollar led to reduced company revenues and gross profit of million 
by contrast  in  an increase in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar led to increased revenue and gross profit of approximately at december   the company had a net exposure representing the difference between euro denominated receivables and euro denominated payables of approximately  in order to partially offset such risk  at december   the company entered into a day euro hedge contract 
the company enters into similar hedging transactions various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks it bears throughout the year 
the company does not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during the year ended december   the company experienced a net loss of  on hedging transactions it executed during in an effort to limit its exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate 
as of december   the company had no variable rate debt  but had approximately million of variable rate debt as of december   all denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
as long as the company does not have variable rate debt  the company s interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
