item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company  through skywest  operates a regional airline offering scheduled passenger service with approximately  daily departures to cities in states and canada 
all of skywest s flights are operated as either delta connection or united express under code sharing arrangements with delta or united 
total operating revenues and passengers carried have grown consistently from through at compounded annual growth rates of approximately and  respectively 
in  skywest generated approximately billion available seat miles asms and had a fleet of fifty brasilias and ten crjs at year end 
as a result of expanding the company s code sharing arrangements with delta and united and additional aircraft acquisitions  skywest generated approximately billion asms in with a fleet of brasilias and crjs at year end 
skywest has been a code sharing partner with delta in salt lake city and united in los angeles since and  respectively 
in april  skywest expanded its united express agreement to provide service as united express in united s portland and seattle tacoma markets and in additional los angeles markets which began in april in january  skywest expanded its operations to serve as the united express carrier in san francisco which began in june in november  skywest expanded its operations to serve as the delta connection carrier in dallas ft 
worth 
today  skywest operates as the delta connection in salt lake city and dallas ft 
worth and as united express in los angeles  san francisco  denver and in the pacific northwest 
skywest believes that its success in attracting multiple code sharing relationships is attributed to its delivery of high quality customer service and a competitive cost structure 
multiple code sharing relationships have enabled skywest to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of skywest controlled flying and contract flying 
on skywest controlled flights  skywest controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receives a prorated portion of passenger fares 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories with skywest receiving from its major airline partners negotiated payments per flight departure and incentives related to passenger volumes and levels of customer service 
essentially all of the company s united express flights have been under contract flying from inception of the united agreement in the company transitioned all of its delta connection crj flights to contract flying october  and transitioned all of its delta connection brasilia flights to contract flying effective january  this transition resulted in essentially all skywest flights operating as contract flying as of january  during the year ended december   approximately of skywest s capacity was under the delta code and was under the united code 
as of december   the company had agreements to acquire an additional crjs with deliveries from january through january and options for an additional crjs 
these aircraft will be allocated between the company s delta connection and united express operations 
on september   the faa grounded all flights to  from  and within the united states as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york  washington dc  and pennsylvania 
all airports were closed and did not reopen until september  when flights were permitted to resume  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than prior to the attacks 
united reduced its flight schedule to approximately of the schedule it flew prior to september th 
as a result  skywest began to reduce its brasilia fleet flown under the united code 
during the year ended december   the company terminated certain brasilia aircraft leases early and recorded a million write off of unamortized engine overhauls and an accrual of million for the remaining lease payments related to brasilia aircraft parked as of december  to help compensate airlines for their losses  the us government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the stabilization act 
under this act  the company received approximately million to help compensate for losses resulting from the terrorist attacks of which and million was recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively 
on december   united filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
united s bankruptcy filing is due in part to the tremendous operational and financial challenges faced by the airline industry in general  and the company s major partners in particular 
among other factors  the airline industry has been and will continue to be affected by the september  terrorist attacks and the recently commenced war with iraq  the slowing us economy  higher fuel and insurance costs  and tightened credit markets 
as the company s major partners restructure to address such challenges  they have required  and will likely continue to require  the company s participation in efforts to reduce costs and improve their financial performance 
management believes these developments will impact the company s operations and financial performance 
in particular  the company anticipates that its financial performance  including its margins  will be less predictable than in prior periods and will be negatively impacted as the industry under goes significant restructuring 
significant accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements contained herein 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and require management s subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  and impairment of long lived assets as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and freight revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under the company s contract flying agreements with delta and united  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
passenger tickets sold but not used and the liability to other airlines are recorded as air traffic liability 
in and  the company reached separate ten year agreements with delta and united  respectively  to fly routes under contract flying arrangements 
the company is compensated on a fee per departure basis plus incentive payments based on operational performance 
the fee per departure and incentive amounts are adjusted on an annual basis based on changes in projected operating costs 
when the negotiations for the fee per departure rates are not completed within a respective period  the company records revenues based on the prior period s approved rates and assumptions to reflect changes in the company s operating structure that management believes are reasonable 
the agreements with delta and united contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
as of december   the company and delta had established rates to be in effect for the company s delta connection flights throughout on december   united filed for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
due to the bankruptcy filing  the company and united began to operate under a temporary departure rate model while the rates are being finalized and a new long term operating agreement is affirmed within the bankruptcy process 
the company estimates that as of the date of united s bankruptcy filing  it was owed approximately million for united express services rendered prior to the filing 
it is the company s understanding that united has received approval from the us bankruptcy court authorizing  but not requiring  united to honor pre petition obligations to its united express carriers 
the company believes that if these pre petition amounts are not paid by united  the company may offset amounts owed to united for pre petition services totaling approximately million 
approximately million of the million claim resulting from united s failure to pay the scheduled weekly wire transfer on december  as a result of united s financial position and related contingencies  the company did not recognize the million as revenue due to the uncertainty of collection 
additionally  as of december   the company established a reserve against the remaining prepetition receivables from united 
management believes that substantially all of the company s ongoing revenues will be generated pursuant to the contract flying arrangements with delta and united 
the company s revenues could be impacted by changes to the contracts  the annual contract negotiations and the company s ability to earn incentive payments contemplated by the contracts 
maintenance the company operates under an faa approved continuous inspection and maintenance program 
the company s historical maintenance accounting policy for engine overhaul costs has included a combination of accruing for overhaul costs on a per flight hour basis at rates estimated to be sufficient to cover the overhauls the accrual method and capitalizing the cost of engine overhauls and expensing the capitalized cost over the estimated useful life of the overhaul the deferral method 
the company uses the deferral method of accounting for brasilia engines and was using the accrual method for crj engines through december  as discussed below  during the quarter ended march   the company elected to change its method of accounting for crj engine overhauls to expensing overhaul maintenance events as incurred the direct expense method 
the costs of maintenance for airframe and avionics components  landing gear and normal recurring maintenance are expensed as incurred 
for leased aircraft  the company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
for brasilia engine overhauls related to leased aircraft to be returned  the company adjusts the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
effective august   the company and ge engine services  inc ge executed a sixteen year engine services agreement the services agreement covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of crj engines 
under the terms of the services agreement  the company agreed to pay ge a fixed rate per engine hour  payable monthly  and ge assumed the responsibility to overhaul the company s crj engines as required during the term of the services agreement  subject to certain exclusions 
the company accounted for all crj engine overhaul costs through december  under the accrual method using an estimated hourly accrual rate through august   and then  for the period from august  through december   using the fixed rate per engine hour pursuant to the services agreement 
in response to changing market conditions  the company and one of its major partners agreed to modify the method of reimbursement for crj engine overhaul costs under their contract flying arrangement beginning in from reimbursement based on engine flight hours to reimbursement based on actual engine overhaul costs at the maintenance event 
in april  the company and ge signed a letter agreement the letter agreement amending the services agreement in response to the change with the company s major partner 
pursuant to the letter agreement  payments under the services agreement were modified from the per engine hour basis  payable monthly  to a time and materials basis  payable at the maintenance event 
the revised payment schedule extended through december   at which time monthly payments were to resume on the fixed rate per engine hour  as adjusted for the difference in the actual payments made under the letter agreement during as compared to the payments that would have been made under the services agreement during as discussed below  on march   the services agreement was further amended 
due to the change in the company s contractual arrangement with one of its major partners and based on the letter agreement  the company elected to change from the accrual method to the direct expense method for crj engine overhaul costs effective january  the company believes the direct expense method is preferable in the circumstances because the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed  the direct expense method eliminates significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method  and it is the predominant method used in the airline industry 
accordingly  during the three months ended march   the company reversed its engine overhaul accrual that totaled million as of january  by recording a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million net of income taxes of million 
the following table summarizes the pro forma impact as if the change in accounting principle was made retroactive to january  in thousands year ended december  historical pro forma operating expenses   operating income   net income   net income per common share basic diluted the letter agreement discussed above did not relieve the company from the fixed rate per engine hour obligation under the services agreement and therefore a maintenance contract liability to ge of million  based on the fixed rate per engine hour  has been recorded in the accompanying december   consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding deferred maintenance asset of million 
the deferred maintenance asset has been recorded since under the expense method the company does not record maintenance expense until the actual maintenance event occurs 
on march   the company and ge amended the services agreement to provide that the company will pay for services performed by ge on a time and materials basis as opposed to the fixed rate per engine hour as stipulated in the services agreement and as modified for in the letter agreement 
further  the amendment provides that payments made by the company for services completed since the effective date of the services agreement august  will be considered to be in satisfaction of all amounts owed by the company for work performed under the services agreement as of december  as a result of the amendment  the million maintenance contract liability and corresponding million deferred maintenance asset have been reversed in march impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of flight equipment and related long lived assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the company  including estimated useful lives and salvage values 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment at each balance sheet date for events or changes in circumstances that may indicate the book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or group of assets over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of other groups of assets 
during  the company recorded a million write off of unamortized engine overhauls as a result of united reducing its flight schedule after the september  terrorist attacks

consolidated operating revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues  increased to million for the year ended december  from million or of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a increase in revenue passenger miles  principally as a result of the delivery of additional crjs over the past twelve months 
the company continued to increase its services with its code sharing partners and placed additional crjs in service during the year ended december  nine of these aircraft were placed in service under the delta connection operations and were placed in service under the united express operations 
revenue per asm decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in asms produced by crjs  which have lower cost per asm than brasilias  resulting in lower revenue per asm pursuant to the terms of the company s code sharing agreements with delta and united  and due to the transition to essentially all contract flying as of january  passenger load factor increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in load factor was due primarily to the further development of code sharing relationships with united and delta whereby skywest is experiencing higher load factors as the company transitions to crjs in its new markets 
the increase was also due  in part  to refinements in skywest s flight schedules 
total operating expenses and interest increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of additional crjs being added to the fleet in the last twelve months 
as a percentage of consolidated operating revenues  total operating expenses and interest decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  primarily as a result of economic efficiency realized from the new crjs 
the company s crjs are less expensive to operate on an asm basis and are operated in markets previously served by delta or united with larger aircraft which has resulted in higher load factors 
airline operating costs per asm including interest expense decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the economic efficiencies realized from the growth in the company s crj fleet year over year and the increased capacity of the crjs  which are less expensive to operate on an asm basis than brasilias 
other factors relating to the change in operating expenses are discussed below 
salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the economic efficiencies realized from the growth in the company s crj fleet year over year as revenues increased year over year while salaries  wages and employee benefits increased only year over year

compared to net income for the year ended december   was million or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million or per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december  the principal reason for the decrease in net income was the disruption of service on september   when the faa grounded all flights as a result of the terrorist attacks in new york  washington  dc and pennsylvania and the subsequent decrease in demand for airline service 
additionally  the company experienced decreases in passenger revenues as a result of the weakening economy 
however  despite these factors  consolidated operating revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  passenger revenues  which represented of consolidated operating revenues  increased to million for the year ended december  from million or of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a increase in revenue passenger miles as the company continued to increase its services with its code sharing partners and placed crjs in service

airline operating costs per asm including interest expense decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  despite the september th events 
the primary reason for the decrease was the increased capacity of crjs  which are less expensive to operate on an asm basis than brasilias 
additionally  during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million in funds received under the stabilization act  which partially offset increased costs associated with the september  terrorist attacks 
other factors relating to the change in operating expenses are discussed below 
salaries  wages and employee benefits increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was principally the result of the service disruption and the decrease in demand for airline service resulting from the september th events 
the average number of full time equivalent employees for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in number of employees was due in large part  to the addition of personnel required for skywest s expansion 
salaries  wages and employee benefits per asm decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in costs was due to the increase in stage lengths flown by crjs that have been added to skywest s fleet and continued operational improvements 
aircraft costs  including aircraft rent and depreciation  increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the early termination and return of seven leased brasilias flown under the united code 
the termination of these leases resulted in a million write off of unamortized engine overhauls related to the aircraft 
aircraft costs per asm increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in costs was due to the million write off  a higher mix of new aircraft within the fleet and build up costs associated with the delivery of these new aircraft 
maintenance expense increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to airline operating revenues increasing only period over period  while asms increased 
the increase was also due to an adjustment to the crj engine overhaul accrual based on a change to the hourly accrual rate and for actual overhaul costs in excess of amounts previously accrued 
maintenance expense per asm increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  and increased period over period 
these increases were due to the increase in asms and increased general maintenance costs in connection with the return of seven brasilias through lease termination as well as the adjustment to the crj engine overhaul accrual 
fuel costs decreased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the average price of fuel decreasing per gallon to from 
fuel costs per asm decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  other expenses  primarily consisting of commissions  landing fees  station rentals  computer reservation system fees and hull and liability insurance  increased as a percentage of airline operating revenues to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of skywest aircraft being grounded because of the september  terrorist attacks and the increase in liability insurance as a result of the september th events 
expenses other than insurance per asm remained constant at for both years ended december  and due to the change in mix from the thirty seat brasilias to the fifty seat crjs 
in september  the us federal government passed the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the act 
under the act  funds were made available to compensate air carriers for direct losses suffered as a result of any federal ground stop order and incremental losses beginning september   and ending december   resulting from the september   terrorist attacks on the united states 
during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately million under the act as a contra expense in its consolidated statement of income 
liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of million and a current ratio of at december   compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase of million in net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  the principal sources of cash included million provided by operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment  million from the sale of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan and million in net deposits on aircraft and rotables 
during  the company invested million in flight equipment  million in marketable securities and million in buildings  ground equipment and other assets

significant commitments and obligations the following table summarizes the company s commitments and obligations as of december  for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments     operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations  principal maturities on long term debt    total commitments and obligations    during the year ended december   skywest took delivery of crjs in connection with the delta connection and united express expansion 
additionally  as of december   skywest had agreed to acquire an additional crjs and related spare parts inventory and support equipment at an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
skywest commenced delivery of these aircraft in january and deliveries are scheduled to continue through january depending on the state of the aircraft financing market at the time of delivery  management will determine whether to acquire these aircraft through  long term loans or lease arrangements 
skywest also has options to acquire additional crjs at fixed prices subject to cost escalations and delivery schedules 
the options are exercisable at various dates through april the company has significant long term lease obligations primarily relating to its aircraft fleet 
these leases are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the company leased aircraft with remaining lease terms ranging from one to years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  at a discount factor  the present value of these lease obligations would be approximately million at december  the company s long term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of brasilia and crj aircraft 
certain amounts related to the brasilia aircraft are supported by continuing subsidy payments through the export support program of the federative republic of brazil 
the subsidy payments reduce the stated interest rates to an average effective rate of approximately  on million of the long term debt  at december  the continuing subsidy payments are at risk to the company if the federative republic of brazil does not meet its obligations under the export support program 
while the company has no reason to believe  based on information currently available  that the company will not continue to receive these subsidy payments from the federative republic of brazil in the future  there can be no assurance that such a default will not occur 
on the remaining long term debt related to the brasilia aircraft of million  the lender has assumed the risk of the subsidy payments and the average effective rate on this debt is approximately at december  the average effective rate on the debt related to the crj aircraft of million was at december   and is not subject to subsidy payments 
seasonality as is common in the airline industry  skywest s operations are favorably affected by increased travel  historically occurring in the summer months  and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from november through january and by inclement weather which occasionally results in cancelled flights  principally during the winter months 
however  skywest does expect some mitigation of the historical seasonal trends due to an increase in the portion of its operations in contract flying 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  the company has not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and expects to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet its future needs 
effective january   the company s contracts with its major partners obligate its major partners to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
as such  during the terms of those contracts the company anticipates that its results from operations will not be directly affected by fuel price volatility 
interest rates the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
however  the company would also receive higher amounts of interest income on its cash and securities held at the time 
at december   the company had variable rate notes representing of its total long term debt compared with of its total long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  the impact of market risk is estimated using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both the company s variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  the company would have incurred an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  and an additional  in interest expense and received  in additional interest income for the year ended december  as a result of this hypothetical assumption  the company believes it could fund interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt with the increased amounts of interest income 
management does not believe the company has significant exposure to the changing interest rates on its fixed rate long term debt instruments  which represent of the total long term debt at december  and at december
