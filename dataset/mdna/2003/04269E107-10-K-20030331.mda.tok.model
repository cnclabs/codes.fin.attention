item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception we have primarily provided fee based chemistry services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to produce and develop novel chemical compounds with commercial potential 
we primarily manufacture arrays of synthesized compounds for delivery to our customers for use in lead compound generation 
in addition  we have established a number of joint drug discovery programs with biotechnology companies and academic institutions 
our current goal is to continue to provide a high level of service and commitment to our existing collaborations while we use our chemistry experience and expertise and unique technology platform to transition arqule to a drug discovery company 
our strategy to achieve this transition is to develop  test and validate our chemistry expertise and technology platform internally and through collaboration with pharmaceutical partners 
in the future we hope to increase the extent to which arqule shares in the economic benefit of our partners drug development 
accordingly  we may offer collaboration models that are potentially more lucrative but riskier to us in that the scientific outcomes for which we would be compensated  typically developmental milestones  will be less predictable than production goals or fee based chemistry services 
at the same time  we plan to apply our lead generation and optimization expertise and technology to internal drug discovery efforts by generating and optimizing our own lead compounds with the aim of out licensing or selling drug candidates upon completion of phase i and  possibly  phase ii clinical trials 
in addition  we will explore strategic options that could allow us to obtain a clinical portfolio in a biological or therapeutic area 
this could include in licensing opportunities  acquisitions or internally building a scientific competence in a biological or therapeutic area 
our revenues have historically been generated primarily through our collaborative agreements for production and delivery of compound arrays and other research and development services 
under many of these collaborative agreements we are also entitled to receive milestone and royalty payments if the customer develops products resulting from the collaboration 
to date  we have received three milestone payments and no royalty payments 
in addition  we have not yet received any milestone or royalty revenue from our joint discovery programs with biotechnology companies or academic institutions  or from our internal drug discovery programs 
we anticipate our revenues will decrease in as we intensify our transition to become a drug discovery company 
we do not anticipate any revenue from our internal drug development program until the successful completion of clinical trials at least through phase i  which may take several years or which may never take place or be successfully completed 
our performance may vary from expectations  including quarterly variations in performance  because levels of revenue are dependent on our expanding or continuing existing collaborations  entering into additional corporate collaborations  and receiving future milestones and royalty payments  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
see discussion of our revenue recognition policy under critical accounting policies below 
as we further our transition to become a drug discovery company we may establish an area of focus in certain therapeutic areas or target classes by acquisition  in licensing or developing internal expertise 
such transactions could allow us to move more quickly toward developing candidates for clinical trials 
we may also continue to invest in technology to enhance or expand our capabilities in drug discovery 
investments of this nature may result in near term earnings fluctuations or impact the magnitude of profitability or loss 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million through december  losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development activities related to our efforts to develop our technologies  the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts  and from the cost of acquisitions 
while we were profitable in fiscal year  we were not profitable in or  and we expect that we will not be profitable in our ability to achieve sustained profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to perform under our collaborations at the expected cost  expansion or continuation of existing collaborations  timing of additional investments in technology  our ability to make acquisitions and to integrate their operation with our own  and the realization of value from the development and commercialization of products in which we have an economic interest  all of which are difficult to anticipate 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a contains forward looking statements reflecting management s current expectations regarding our future performance 
such expectations are based on certain assumptions regarding the progress of product development efforts under collaborative agreements  the executions of new collaborative agreements and other factors relating to our growth 
such expectations may not materialize if product development efforts are delayed or suspended  if negotiations with potential collaborators are delayed or unsuccessful or if other assumptions prove incorrect 
acquisition of camitro corporation in january  we acquired camitro corporation camitro  a privately held predictive modeling company based in menlo park  california 
at the time of the acquisition  camitro had developed various computational models for admet characterization of compounds based on their structure 
we were hopeful that with further development this technology could be commercialized and generate incremental future cash flow either through granting customers licenses to access this technology directly or by integrating it into our own chemistry based technology platform as a basis for a new collaborative arrangement 
these efforts have been unsuccessful  and arqule has ceased further development and commercialization efforts of these models 
see further discussion under restructuring actions and impairment charges below 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock and million in cash in exchange for all of camitro s outstanding shares and the assumption of all of camitro s outstanding stock options and warrants 
the merger transaction was valued at million based on our share price on the measurement date for the merger 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction 
upon consummation of the camitro acquisition in january  we immediately charged to income million representing the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this k 
the value was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate in each project took into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the purchased in process technology 
the resulting net cash flows from such projects were based on management s best estimates of revenue  cost of sales  research and development costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes from such projects 
the net cash flows reflect the assumptions that would be used by market participants 
restructuring actions and impairment charges in december  we announced a major restructuring of our operations whereby we ceased further development and commercialization of the admet predictive models and realigned our workforce to expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the decision was precipitated by our inability to successfully commercialize the admet predictive modeling technology to generate incremental cash flow through either direct access fees or a predictive model based collaborative agreement 
the restructuring actions included closing our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom  along with the termination of employees in these facilities and our massachusetts facilities 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million  the components of which are as follows in thousands termination benefits  facilities related  property and equipment  other charges total restructuring charges  termination benefits relate to severance and benefit costs associated with the elimination of managerial and staff positions worldwide  comprising approximately of the workforce  in the following areas positions in research and development functions and positions in administrative functions 
facility related costs relate to the remaining lease payment obligations associated with the abandonment of our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom  net of assumed sublease income 
property and equipment charges relate to the non cash write off of leasehold improvements and equipment no longer expected to provide future economic benefit at the abandoned facilities  less assumed proceeds from sale 
other charges include a  non cash stock compensation charge related to arqule s contractual obligation to remove all restrictions related to restricted stock of certain employees who were involuntarily terminated  plus contractual obligations which provide no future value to the company and other miscellaneous costs associated with closing the california and united kingdom operations 
see critical accounting policies below for a discussion of our accounting policy for restructuring charges and a description of management s significant estimates 
we anticipate that these actions will result in savings of approximately million per year in personnel and facility related expenses 
through december   arqule had the following restructuring activity and remaining accruals in thousands restructuring charges non cash charges cash payments restructuring accrual at december  termination benefits   facilities related   property and equipment   other charges total restructuring accrual    the company eliminated positions in december  the remaining positions will be eliminated by march  the remaining termination benefit costs will be paid in installments through april facility costs will be paid out through the remaining lease terms of the facilities  which extend through in december  we performed assessments of the recovery of the carrying value of our core technology intangible asset and our goodwill asset 
these assessments required management to make a number of estimates concerning future potential cash flow of these assets and of the fair value of the company as a whole 
as a result of these assessments  the company recorded impairment charges relative to its core technology and goodwill assets of million and million  respectively  representing the entire remaining carrying value of these assets 
see critical accounting policies below for a discussion of our accounting policy for long lived assets and a description of management s significant estimates 
results of operations years ended december   and increase decrease to to in millions revenue as compared to revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to a million increase in custom array library revenues from the expanded pfizer agreement  partially offset by reductions in revenue from wyeth of million  from johnson and johnson of million  and from sankyo of million as these collaborations wind down 
we expect revenue to decrease in as we make the transition to a drug discovery company  and we do not anticipate deriving revenue from our internal drug discovery programs until they reach a later stage 
as compared to revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to increased fees of approximately million for delivery of custom array sets to pfizer and bayer 
increase decrease to to in millions cost of revenue gross margin of revenue pts pts as compared to cost of revenue increased due to increased cost of personnel and materials necessary to satisfy the expanded pfizer collaboration 
our gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased by percentage points due to the increased labor and material costs necessary to fulfill the pfizer and bayer collaborations 
we expect cost of revenue to continue to increase  and gross margin percentage to continue to decrease  in primarily due to increased personnel and labor related cost associated with our pfizer collaboration 
as compared to the increase in cost of revenue was attributable to increased costs of producing custom array sets for pfizer and bayer 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased by primarily due to increased costs relating to the bayer collaboration 
increase decrease to to in millions research and development as compared to the million increase primarily consists of an additional million in personnel and related costs and  of additional third party information system technology as the result of our efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry  biology  predictive and computational modeling capabilities and related proprietary technologies 
the company devoted additional personnel and resources to the integration and refinement of the respective technologies in order to advance the objective of a fully integrated drug discovery platform 
we expect research and development expense to decrease in as the company more narrowly focuses its resources on drug discovery programs  and as a result of our decision to cease further development of internal admet predictive models for third party commercialization 
as compared to the increase in absolute dollars of million is primarily related to the merger with camitro in january the addition of camitro accounted for approximately million of the increase due to the addition of approximately employees and their related salary  support and facility expense 
the remainder of the increase is the result of continued efforts to augment and enhance our chemistry and computational modeling capabilities and related proprietary technologies  including increased personnel  as we expand our drug discovery programs and technology platform 
increase decrease to to in millions marketing  general and administrative as compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses were essentially flat year over year 
as compared to the increase was primarily associated with the addition of camitro  which accounted for million of the increase  and increased support costs  including increased personnel  to support our growth in increase decrease to to in millions stock based compensation nm amortization of core technology nm amortization of goodwill nm impairment of core technology nm nm impairment of goodwill nm nm in process research and development nm total acquisition related charges nm nm not meaningful acquisition related charges all relate to the january acquisition of camitro 
in  we recorded stock based compensation expense  amortization of goodwill and core technology and wrote off in process research and development cost of the acquired entity 
in  we continued to recognize stock based compensation charges based on the amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of stock options issued below market value and restricted stock to former employees of camitro  in addition to amortizing core technology 
we implemented statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in january  and accordingly ceased recording periodic goodwill amortization charges in lieu of performing annual assessments for impairment 
at december   we assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of our core technology and goodwill balances and  based on the applicable accounting standards  recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  representing the entire remaining balances of these assets 
see critical accounting policies below for a discussion of our accounting policies and significant estimates 
increase decrease to to in millions interest income interest expense interest income  net interest income is derived from our portfolio of cash and short term investments 
interest income increased from to due primarily to increased average principal balances in as a result of the million proceeds from our follow on stock offering in november  which offset the unfavorable impact of lower average interest rates 
interest income decreased in from due to lower average principal balances and continued lower average interest rates 
interest expense increased from to based on higher average debt balances on our term loan with fleet national bank 
interest expense decreased in due to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources increase decrease to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital cash flow from operating activities investing activities nm financing activities nm not meaningful at december  we held cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  down million  or  from million at the end of we had working capital of million at december   down million  or  from million at the end of we have historically funded our operations through the sale of common stock  payments from collaborators and bank financing 
cash flow from operating activities for of million  compared to million in  was comprised of a net loss  excluding non cash charges  of million  which was more than offset by net changes in working capital  primarily related to the timing of payments from corporate collaborators of million and unpaid accruals for restructuring actions of million 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities was million in  compared to a use of million in the use was comprised of capital expenditures of million  offset by net proceeds of million from the sale or maturity of available for sale securities 
included in capital expenditures is approximately million related to leasehold improvements to our facility in redwood city  california  while the balance related primarily to chemistry and information systems to increase and improve our production capabilities to support our corporate collaborations 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities was million in  compared to an million source in the use was comprised million of principal repayments on our term loan to fleet national bank  partially offset by additional borrowings of million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
on september   we amended our term loan agreement with fleet national bank to allow for additional borrowings of up to million to finance the build out associated with our new leased facility in redwood city  california 
the incremental new borrowing is termed the facility three term loan 
principal payments on the facility three term loan will be made in monthly installments starting on april  interest payments will be made monthly in arrears beginning on october   and interest accrues at the libor rate plus basis points 
as of december  we had borrowed the full million against the facility three term loan 
we anticipate our investment profile for cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets and the timing of specific investments 
we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with operating revenues and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements for the next several years 
we have been cash flow positive from operations for three consecutive years  and coupled with our existing cash and marketable securities  we believe that even without additional funding we would have sufficient funds to operate for at least the next several years 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into any additional corporate collaborations in the future and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  the need for currently unanticipated capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers for our products and services  or that such products and services will produce revenues adequate to fund our operating expenses 
if we experience increased losses  we may have to seek additional financing from public and private sale of our securities  including equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available when needed or on acceptable terms 
we lease facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
at december   the minimum lease commitments for all leased facilities and equipment are as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases thereafter  total minimum lease payments  included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to abandoned real estate which was accrued as a liability as a part of the company s restructuring charges in see restructuring charges included in this md a 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information 
revenue recognition arqule has entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
revenue from collaborative agreements includes non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  the delivery of compounds  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborators specified criteria  and certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
non refundable technology transfer fees are recognized as revenue when we have the contractual right to receive such payment  provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
when we have performance obligations under the terms of a contract  non refundable fees are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations 
where our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  the revenue is recognized on a straight line basis 
funding of compound development work is recognized over the term of the applicable contract using the proportional achievement of deliveries against a compound delivery schedule or the development labor expended against a total research and development labor plan as the measure of progress toward completion 
any significant changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates to complete a contract eg  changes in the number of man hours to develop compounds  or changes in throughput capacity of our machinery and equipment could impact our revenue recognition 
payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting the collaborator s specified criteria are recognized as revenue once the collaborator has accepted the delivery of these compounds and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment is non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
payments received under these arrangements prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are in full compliance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets consisted primarily of the value of core technology and goodwill  which was recorded in connection with acquisition of camitro corporation in january the company assesses the impairment of intangible assets annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets might not be recoverable based upon one or more indications of impairment the company measures any impairment based on projected future cash flows methods 
the cost of the core technology was being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
we performed an impairment assessment of the carrying value of the core technology in the fourth quarter of in light of our decision to cease development of the admet predictive modeling as a result of our inability to successfully commercialize these models and to generate future cash flow 
based on this assessment  which included an analysis of management estimates that there was no future cash flow resulting from these models  we concluded that the carrying value of the core technology was not recoverable  and accordingly took an impairment charge of million  representing the entire remaining carrying value 
at december   goodwill was approximately million 
beginning january  the company adopted sfas and ceased amortization of goodwill 
as required by sfas  goodwill is subject in to both a transitional goodwill impairment test as of january  and an annual assessment for impairment based on fair value 
the company has determined it consists of a single reporting unit 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test as of january  by comparing the company s fair value to its net assets  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the company s net assets exceeds the company s fair value the goodwill is impaired 
fair value is based on quoted market prices adjusted for a control premium  which is the estimated premium paid in an acquisition of arqule 
the fair value of the reporting unit on january  exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
accordingly  we concluded that no impairment existed as of the january  transition date 
arqule performed its annual assessment for as of july  that analysis also indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the net assets  including goodwill  and therefore we concluded that no impairment existed as of the annual assessment date 
in addition to requiring transitional and annual assessments of goodwill impairment  sfas requires that a goodwill impairment review be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering event indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in december  we announced a restructuring of operations resulting from our decision to cease further development of our admet predictive models and to close our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom 
the company concluded the restructuring charge was a triggering event and that the carrying value of our goodwill asset may be impaired 
accordingly  we conducted an impairment review as required under sfas as of december  and concluded that an impairment had occurred as of that date 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we calculated our implied goodwill as the difference between fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was significantly less than the fair value of our assets and liabilities  which implied goodwill was zero  and therefore recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to write off the entire carrying value of goodwill as of december  this charge is included in operating costs and expenses within the statement of operations in the impairment analyses for the company s core technology intangible asset and goodwill asset involved considerable judgment and use of several estimates  including control premiums and projected cash flows of our admet predictive model 
we used a control premium of in determining the company s fair value based on an analysis of control premiums involved in acquisitions of companies of similar size and in similar industries 
the cash flow assumptions for our admet predictive model were based on management s belief that there is no future potential cash flow associated with arqule commercializing the admet models for third party use or as the basis for a collaborative agreement 
all of these estimates involve significant judgment by the company s management 
although the estimates used reflect management s best estimates based upon all available evidence  the use of different estimates could have yielded different conclusions concerning the impairment of the core technology and goodwill assets 
restructuring charges accruals are established for involuntary employee termination benefits in the same period that the appropriate level of management and the board of directors approve and commit the company to a termination plan that a specifically identifies the number  location and job level of employees to be terminated  b specifies the benefits terminated employees are to receive  c communicates the benefit arrangements to employees  and d assures that employees will be terminated within one year 
accruals are established for property and equipment and facility related costs for facilities to be abandoned that have no future economic benefit to the company in the same period that the appropriate level of management and the board of directors approve and commit the company to an abandonment plan that a specifically identifies all significant actions to be taken to complete the abandonment plan  b will begin as soon as possible after the abandonment plan is approved  and c the period to complete that abandonment plan indicates that significant changes are not likely 
accruals for abandoned property and equipment and for facilities require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning our ability to sublease certain operating leases for abandoned real estate see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this k 
these estimates of the time required to sublease the facilities and sublease rates the company will receive were based on management s analysis of the local real estate markets and general economic conditions in the regions of the abandoned facilities 
if it takes longer to sublease these facilities than the company has estimated  or if the sublease rates are less favorable than estimated  the company may be required to take an additional charge for abandoned real estate of up to million 
conversely  if the space is subleased either earlier than estimated or if the sublease rate actually achieved are more favorable  the company may be required to reverse a portion of its current accrual for abandoned real estate 
investments in non marketable equity securities investments in non marketable equity securities are accounted for under the cost method if arqule owns less than percent of the outstanding stock of the investee and management determines that it does not exert significant influence over the management of the investee 
we assess fair value of investments in non marketable equity securities quarterly  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the event fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value of an investment  the carrying value is written down to fair value if the decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
since there is no readily available market information concerning the fair value of these investments  such assessments require significant management judgment in analyzing the investee s financial position and projected future financial results and cash flows 
as of december   management believes the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company is not less than its carrying value of million 
although the estimates used to reach this conclusion reflect our best estimates of fair value based upon all available information  the use of different estimates could have yielded a different conclusion concerning the recoverability of the carrying value of this investment 
lease commitments we lease approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in medford  massachusetts  the majority of which is used for the pfizer collaboration 
we lease these facilities from cummings properties  llc cummings under two lease agreements  one of which expires on july  and one of which expires on july  the company subleases portions of these facilities pursuant to two sublease agreements 
on august   cummings significantly raised arqule s rent on the lease that expires july  we believe this increase to be in excess of that which is permissible under the lease agreement 
accordingly  on january   we brought a complaint in the superior court of middlesex county in the commonwealth of massachusetts for declaratory relief and damages against cummings arising  in part  out of cummings attempts to increase the lease rates 
nevertheless  during the pendency of this dispute  the we are paying the rental rates proposed by cummings 
the company seeks recovery of the funds that it has already paid  and is paying  under protest 
if we are unsuccessful in our claim against cummings  and must pay all or a portion of the rental expense increase currently proposed by cummings  we may be required to record an additional expense of up to approximately million to record the difference between our contractual rental payments and contractual sublease rental income over the remaining period of the lease

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds and us government and other investment grade debt securities 
these investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help insure liquidity 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these policies  we do not believe we have material exposure due to market risk 
our use of derivative financial instruments is limited to the utilization of two interest rate swap agreements 
settlement accounting is used for these interest rate swaps  which have notional amounts of  and  and expire on june  and june   respectively 
any differences paid or received on interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of each swap  thereby adjusting the effective interest rate of the underlying obligations 
the fair market value of these swaps was an unrecognized loss of  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our use of derivatives and other financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximates fair value at december  due to the short term maturities of these instruments
