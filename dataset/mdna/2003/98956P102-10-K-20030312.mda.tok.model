sales growth reflected strong demand for reconstructive implants and outstanding results in the company s largest operating segment  the americas 
this increase in the americas was partially offset by weak local currencies in asia pacific and europe 
this increase was comprised of a percent increase due to incremental volume and changes in the mix of product sales  a percent increase due to higher average selling prices and a percent decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the introduction of new materials  techniques and technologies has contributed to a significant increase in demand for the company s products and has generally had a favorable effect on sales as average selling prices for the new materials and technologies generally exceed those being replaced 
for example  sales have been favorably affected by a market shift from cruciate retaining designs to posterior stabilized designs for total knee procedures 
the company maintains a relatively strong market position in posterior stabilized knees 
sales have also benefited from a market shift from cemented components to higher priced porous components for total hip replacements

and subsidiaries form k contractual obligations the company has entered into contracts with various third parties in the normal course of business which will require future payments 
the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations less than after contractual obligations total year years years years short term debt operating leases minimum purchase commitments total contractual obligations critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which  in some cases  require management s judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition a significant portion of the company s revenue is recognized for field based product upon notification that the product has been implanted or used 
for all other transactions  the company recognizes revenue when title is passed to customers  generally upon shipment 
estimated returns and allowances are recorded as a reduction of sales when the revenue is recognized 
inventories the company must determine as of each balance sheet date how much  if any  of its inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
reserves are established to effectively adjust any such inventory to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of reserves  the company evaluates current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of its products 
a series of algorithms is applied to the data to assist management in its evaluation 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
further information about inventory reserves is provided in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
instruments the company  as is customary in the industry  consigns surgical instruments for use in orthopaedic procedures with the company s products 
the company s accounting policy requires that the full cost of instruments be recognized as an expense in the year in which the instruments are placed in service 
an alternative to this method is to depreciate the cost of instruments over their useful lives 
the company may from time to time consider a change in accounting for instruments to better align its accounting policy with certain company competitors 
property  plant and equipment the company determines estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment based on historical patterns of use and physical and technological characteristics of assets  as appropriate 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated future cash flows relating to the asset are less than its carrying amount 
derivative financial instruments critical aspects of the company s accounting policy for derivative financial instruments include conditions which require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction 
another important element of the policy requires that formal documentation be maintained as required by the sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings as they occur 
management routinely monitors significant estimates  assumptions and judgments associated with derivative instruments  and compliance with formal documentation requirements 
stock compensation the company applies the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock based compensation  therefore  no compensation expense has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans as options are granted at fair market value 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation provides an alternative method of accounting for stock options based on an option pricing model  such as black scholes 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
information regarding compensation expense under the alternative method is provided in notes to the consolidated financial statements

and subsidiaries form k pensions and other postretirement benefits the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the most significant actuarial assumptions include the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and the expected healthcare cost trend rate 
other actuarial assumptions utilized in determining pension and postretirement benefit costs include  among others  mortality rates and employee turnover rates 
the discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in those rates during the year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of trends and experiences taking into account current and expected market conditions 
a twenty five basis point change in the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a reasonable change in the other actuarial assumptions would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes the company estimates income tax expense and income tax liabilities and assets by taxable jurisdiction 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
the company evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances if it is determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax benefit will not be realized 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the us commitments and contingencies accruals for product liability and other claims are established with internal and external counsel based on current information and historical settlement information for claims  related fees and for claims incurred but not reported 
an actuarial model is used by the company to assist management in determining an appropriate level of accruals for product liability claims 
historical patterns of claim loss development over time are statistically analyzed to arrive at factors which are then applied to loss estimates in the actuarial model 
the amounts established represent management s best estimate of the ultimate costs that it will incur under the various contingencies 
separation from bristol myers squibb the company was incorporated in delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of bristol myers squibb on january  on july   bristol myers squibb transferred the assets and liabilities of its orthopaedic business to the company 
on august   bristol myers squibb distributed all of the shares of company common stock to bristol myers squibb stockholders in the form of a dividend of one share of company common stock  and the associated preferred stock purchase right  for every shares of bristol myers squibb common stock 
in addition  the company assumed all obligations under a million credit facility credit facility established by the company and its former parent with then outstanding borrowings of million 
with additional borrowings under the credit facility  the company repaid amounts due to its former parent of approximately million  and finally  the company assumed an additional million of borrowings under the credit facility for separation costs 
in addition  the company recognized certain liabilities and obligations for pension  post retirement  long term disability and us sales agent benefits 
recognition of these liabilities and obligations and other adjustments were reflected in the remaining net investment in the company by its former parent of million as of the distribution and subsequently reclassified to opening retained earnings 
the distribution qualified as a tax free transaction under section and a of the internal revenue code of as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein under item the company incurred million million net of taxes in costs  fees and expenses relating to the separation from bristol myers squibb and the related distribution of company common stock to bristol myers squibb stockholders which was partially funded by additional borrowings under the credit facility 
the costs  fees and expenses were primarily for retention bonuses  legal separation matters  professional expenses and costs of producing  printing  mailing and distributing the information statement relating to the distribution 
except for separation costs and the ongoing interest cost associated with debt assumed or incurred as of the distribution  the company does not currently anticipate that operating costs resulting from the separation from its former parent will materially impact its cost structure as reflected in its historical consolidated results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks as part of its ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices  that could impact its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company manages its exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and on a limited basis  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are used solely as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its transactions and net assets denominated in japanese yen and the euro 
the company manages the foreign currency exposure centrally  on a combined basis  which allows the company to net exposures and to take advantage of any natural offsets 
in order to reduce the uncertainty of foreign exchange rate movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange forward contracts with major international financial institutions 
these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions  primarily intercompany sale and purchase transactions  for periods consistent with commitments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges are temporarily recorded in other comprehensive income  then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects net earnings 
the notional amounts of outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts  principally japanese yen and the euro  entered into with third parties  at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
for all contracts outstanding at december  the company has obligation to purchase us dollars and sell japanese yen and the euro at set maturity dates ranging from january through september the weighted average contract rates for and are and yen and and euro  respectively 
the company maintains written policies and procedures governing its risk management activities 
the company s policy requires that critical terms of hedging instruments are the same as hedged forecasted transactions 
on this basis  with respect to cash flow hedges  changes in cash flows attributable to hedged transactions are generally expected to be completely offset by changes in the fair value of hedge instruments 
as part of its risk management program  the company furthermore performs sensitivity analyses to assess potential changes in revenue  operating results  cash flows and financial position relating to hypothetical movements in currency exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december   indicated that  if the us dollar uniformly changed in value by percent relative to the japanese yen and the euro  with no change in the interest differentials  the fair value of those contracts would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes  depending on the direction of the change  by an average approximate amount of million and million for the yen and euro contracts  respectively 
any change in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be largely offset by a change in the value of the hedged transaction 
consequently  foreign exchange contracts would not subject the company to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
the company had net investment exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily in the japanese yen and the euro 
commodity price risk the company purchases raw material commodities such as cobalt chrome  titanium  tantalum  medical grade polymer and sterile packaging 
the company enters into to month supply contracts on these commodities to alleviate the impact of market fluctuation in prices 
as part of the company s risk management program  sensitivity analyses related to potential commodity price changes are performed 
a percent price change across all these commodities would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risks through its regular operations and financing activities 
presently  the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in money market and investment grade short term debt instruments 
the primary investment objective is to ensure capital preservation of its invested principal funds by limiting default and market risk 
currently  the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with its credit 
table of contents zimmer holdings  inc 
and subsidiaries form k facilities 
the company is subject to movements in interest rate risk on the committed credit facility and its uncommitted credit facilities 
presently  all of its debt outstanding is floating 
the company currently does not hedge its interest rate exposure  but may do so in the future 
based upon the company s overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s earnings or cash flows over a one year period 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action  nor management actions to mitigate interest rate changes 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
presently  the company intends to utilize cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk  are primarily cash  cash equivalents  counterparty transactions  and accounts receivable 
the company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions and money market instruments  and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one entity 
the company does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the financial institutions with which it conducts business 
however  this loss is limited to the amounts  if any  by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligation of the company 
the company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions 
credit risk is managed through the monitoring of counterparty financial condition and by the use of standard credit guidelines 
the company does not anticipate any nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
concentration of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across a number of geographic areas and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
however  essentially all of the company s trade receivables are concentrated in the public and private hospital and healthcare industry in the us and internationally or with distributors who operate in international markets and  accordingly  are exposed to their respective business  economic and country specific variables 
repayment is dependent upon the financial stability of these industry sectors and the respective countries national economic and health care systems 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures and the company believes that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
