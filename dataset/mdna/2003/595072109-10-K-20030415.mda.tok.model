overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  with an average amount financed of approximately  the company primarily leases pos authorization systems and other small business equipment to small commercial enterprises 
for the years ended december  and  the company had fundings to dealers upon origination of leases  contracts and loans dealer fundings of million and million  respectively  and revenues of million and million  respectively 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments  and fee income 
the company funds the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
as of september   the credit facility failed to renew and the company has been paying down the balance on the basis of a month amortization plus interest 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the credit facility  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings  a consolidated tangible net worth minimum of million plus of net income quarterly beginning with september  and compliance with the borrowing base 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the securitization agreements  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings and a consolidated tangible net worth greater than million plus of net income for each fiscal quarter after june  on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waives the defaults described above  and in consideration for this waiver  requires the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company received a waiver  which was set to expire on april   for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement 
subsequently  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
in october  the company made the decision to suspend new contract originations until a source of funding is obtained 
the company is currently in the process of pursuing alternative financing sources 
the company has been advised by the new york stock exchange nyse that it is currently not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards 
specifically  the company does not meet the following requirements based on a consecutive thirty day trading period  average market capitalization of not less than million and a share price of not less than 
in accordance with the continued listing criteria set forth by the nyse  the company has presented a plan which management believes has the potential to bring the company back into compliance with the listing standards within the required timeframes 
the nyse is currently reviewing the plan that was submitted on april in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are noncancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
the initial noncancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  substantially all service and rental contracts are month to month contracts with expected terms of years for service contracts  months for lessees that continue to rent their equipment beyond the original term  and months for other types of rental contracts 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
the company determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition and maintaining the allowance for credit losses 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interests is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
rental equipment is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of the historical loss experience of the company and the level of recourse provided by such lease  service contract  rental contract or loan  if any  and reflects management s judgment of additional loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature and characteristics of the underlying lease portfolio 
the company determines the necessary periodic provision for credit losses taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans 
such provisions generally represent a percentage of funded amounts of leases  contracts and loans 
the resulting charge is included in the provision for credit losses 
leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses and are put on non accrual when they are deemed to be uncollectable 
generally  the company deems leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans to be uncollectable when one of the following occurs i the obligor files for bankruptcy  ii the obligor dies  and the equipment is returned  or iii when an account has become days delinquent without contact with the lessee 
the typical monthly payment under the company s leases is between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee will only owe lease payments of between and the company has developed and regularly updates proprietary credit scoring systems designed to improve its risk based pricing 
the company uses credit scoring in most  but not all  of its extensions of credit 
in addition  the company aggressively employs collection procedures and a legal process to resolve any credit problems 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december   due primarily to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income  offset by an increase of  or in rental and service contract income over such amounts in the previous year s period 
the decrease in income on financing leases and loans was due to the decreased number of leases originated primarily resulting from the company s decision during the third quarter of to suspend the funding of new contracts 
the decrease in fee income and other income is the result of decreased fees from the lessees related to the collection and legal process employed by the company 
the increase in rental and service contract income is a result of the increased number of lessees that have continued to rent their equipment beyond their original lease term  the acquisition of the rental portfolio of resource leasing corporation  and increased originations in rental and service contracts 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  marketing programs increased by million or  due to increased dealer payments made on a portfolio of leases acquired in legal services increased by million or  primarily due to costs incurred for the different class actions and investigations and in conjunction with the workout on the company s credit facility and securitization covenant defaults 
compensation expenses decreased by million or primarily due to staff reductions 
the company s provision for credit losses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   while net charge offs increased to million 
this provision was based on the company s historical policy  based on experience  of providing a provision for credit losses based upon the dealer fundings and revenue recognized in any period and reflects management s judgement of loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature of the underlying receivables 
the company took an additional provision of million during the third quarter of to reserve against certain dealer receivables as well as delinquent portfolio assets 
in the past  dealer receivables had been offset  in some instances  against the funding of new contracts 
since the company has suspended the funding of new deals  the company feels that the collection of these receivables will be more difficult 
although the company will continue to pursue collections on these accounts  management believes that the cost associated with the legal enforcement would outweigh the benefits realized 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  due to the increased number of rental contracts and amortization of the company s investment in service contracts 
interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the company s declining cost of funds as well as a decreased level of borrowings 
dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the company s decision during the third quarter of to suspend new contract originations until a new line of credit is obtained 
receivables due in installments  estimated residual values  loans receivable  investment in service contracts  and investment in rental equipment also decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million during the year ended december   or  from the year ended december  because of the decrease in the size of the company s overall portfolio 
unearned income decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in dealer fundings during year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the year ended december   due primarily to increases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans  million  or  in rental and service contract income  and million  or  in service fee and other income over such amounts in the previous year s period 
the increase in income on financing leases and loans was due to the increased number of leases originated 
the increase in rental and service contract income is a result of the increased number of lessees that have continued to rent their equipment beyond their original lease term  the acquisition of the rental portfolio of resource leasing corporation  and increased originations in rental and service contracts 
the increase in fee income and other income is the result of increased fees from the lessees related to the collection and legal process employed by the company  and the addition of a new line of business of selling equipment out of existing inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  compensation and personnel related expenses increased by million  due to an increase in overall compensation levels and an increase in the number of employees needed to maintain the company s portfolio  including the addition of the personnel employed by resource leasing corporation 
management expects that salaries and employee related expenses  marketing expenses and other selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as the portfolio grows because of the requirements of maintaining the company s microticket portfolio and the company s focus on collections 
also  cost of goods sold increased by million  or  due to the company s acquisition of the assets of resource leasing corporation  and the addition of a new line of business of selling equipment 
the company s provision for credit losses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is a result of the company s historical policy  based on experience  of providing a provision for credit losses based upon the dealer fundings and revenue recognized in any period and reflects management s judgement of loss potential considering current economic conditions and the nature of the underlying receivables 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  due to the increased number of rental contracts  including the addition of the resource leasing portfolio of rental contracts  and amortization of the company s investment in service contracts 
interest expense decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the company s declining cost of funds  offset by an increased level of borrowings 
dealer fundings were million during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is a result of the company s decision during the second quarter of to increase pricing and tighten its credit approval standards 
the new credit policies were put into place in august of this is an ongoing effort  and is expected to continue going forward 
receivables due in installments  estimated residual values  loans receivable  investment in service contracts  and investment in rental equipment also decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing an decrease of million  or 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million during the year ended december   or  from the year ended december  because of the increase in the size of the company s overall portfolio as well as the company s continued emphasis on collections 
unearned income decreased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in dealer fundings during the terrorist attacks of september  caused a significant loss of life and property 
fortunately  the company has not experienced any significant losses as a direct result of the september events 
there can be no assurance that any potential impact associated with the september events would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new leases  contracts and loans 
since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt and an initial public offering completed in february of the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
the company s uses of cash include the origination and acquisition of leases  contracts and loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under its credit facilities  subordinated debt and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
the company utilizes its credit facilities to fund the origination and acquisition of leases that satisfy the eligibility requirements established pursuant to each facility 
on august   the company entered into a new million credit facility with seven banks  expiring on september  as of september  the credit facility failed to renew and the company has been paying down the balance on the basis of a month amortization plus interest 
based on the terms of the agreement  interest rates increased from prime minus to prime plus for prime based loans and from libor plus to libor plus for libor based loans 
in addition  based on the covenant defaults described below  the outstanding borrowings on all loans bear an additional default interest 
on january   the company entered into a forbearance and modification agreement from the senior credit facility which expired on february  based on the terms of the forbearance and modification agreement  interest rates increased again on the prime based loans to prime plus 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under the facility 
the company also may use its subordinated debt program as a source of funding for potential acquisitions of portfolios and leases which otherwise are not eligible for funding under the credit facilities and for potential portfolio purchases 
to date  cash flows from its portfolio and other fees have been sufficient to repay amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and subordinated debt  however  in october  the company made the decision to suspend new contract originations until a source of funding is obtained 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the credit facility  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings  a consolidated tangible net worth minimum of million plus of net income quarterly beginning with september   and compliance with the borrowing base 
on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waives the defaults described above  and in consideration for this waiver  requires the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
based on the amortization schedule in the new agreement  the company is obligated to repay a minimum of million  plus applicable interest  over the next twelve months 
the covenants that were in default with respect to the securitization agreements  require that the company maintain a fixed charge ratio in an amount not less than of consolidated earnings and a consolidated tangible net worth greater than million plus of net income for each fiscal quarter after june  the company received a waiver  which was set to expire on april   for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement 
subsequently  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
the company believes that cash flows from its operations will be sufficient to fund the company s operations for the foreseeable future  given the satisfactory resolution of the company s discussions with the lenders involved in the senior credit facility and the securitized notes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has entered into various agreements  such as the long term debt agreements  capital lease agreements and operating lease agreements that require future payments be made 
long term debt agree ments include all debt outstanding under the credit facility  securitizations  subordinated notes  demand notes and other notes payable 
at december  the repayment schedules for outstanding long term debt  minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases and future minimum lease payments under capital leases were as follows for the year ended long term operating capital december  debt leases leases total thereafter total    recently issued accounting pronouncements see note b of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general risks microfinancial incurred net losses of million for the year ended december  the net losses incurred by the company during the third and fourth quarters caused the company to be in default of certain debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
in addition  as of september   the company s credit facility failed to renew and consequently  the company was forced to suspend new origination activity as of october  on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waives the covenant defaults as of december   and in consideration for this waiver  requires the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company received a waiver  which was set to expire on april   for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement 
subsequently  the company received a permanent waiver of the covenant defaults and the securitization agreement was amended so that going forward  the covenants are the same as those contained in the long term agreement entered into on april   for the senior credit facility 
to date  the company has fulfilled all of its debt obligations  as agreed to by the bank group  in a timely manner 
in an effort to improve its financial position  microfinancial has taken certain steps including the engagement of a financial and strategic advisory firm  triax capital advisors  llc 
management and its advisors are actively considering various financing  restructuring and strategic alternatives as well as continuing to work closely with the company s lenders to obtain long term agreements 
in addition  management has taken steps to reduce overhead  including a reduction in headcount from to the failure or inability of microfinancial to successfully carry out these plans could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and its ability to meet its obligations when due 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
market rate sensitive instruments and risk management the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  and fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company has used interest rate swaps to manage the primary market exposures associated with underlying liabilities and anticipated transactions 
the company used these instruments to reduce risk by creating offsetting market exposures 
the instruments held by the company are not held for trading purposes 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
interest rate risk management the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts  and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s securitizations and subordinated debt represented of the company s total outstanding indebtedness 
in july  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with one of its banks 
this arrangement expired in july the company s credit facility bears interest at rates  which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the day libor 
the company s interest expense on its credit facility and the fair value of its fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on the company s interest expense and the fair value of its fixed rate debt would be  and  respectively
