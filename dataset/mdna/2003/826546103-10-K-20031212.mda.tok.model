a 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year fiscal net sales of million were essentially comparable to fiscal net sales of million 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s business in fiscal  had net sales of million  up from the million in fiscal turbine engine component manufacturing and repair net sales increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  reflecting a million recovery in the fourth quarter of fiscal demand for component repairs for both small and large aerospace turbine engines increased in fiscal  compared with fiscal such increased demand reflects a strong recovery relative to large aerospace turbine engines in the fourth quarter of fiscal this reflects a reduction in component repairs for older model large aerospace turbine engines offset by increased demand for component repairs for newer model large aerospace turbine engines 
the reduced utilization of older generation aircraft that negatively impacted the company in fiscal continued during despite the increase in component repairs for newer model aerospace turbine engines  the commercial airline industry in general continues to experience reduced commercial flight hours  which determines the need for component repairs to newer model aerospace turbine engines 
lower demand for component repairs for industrial turbine engines partially offset the increase in demand for component repairs for both small and large aerospace turbine engines 
net sales associated with the demand for replacement parts  which often complement turbine engine component repair services provided to customers  were up million in to million  compared with million in fiscal the increase in replacement parts net sales is attributable to a change in product mix with certain major customers 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to equipment impairment and million of severance charges related to the further consolidation of the repair group s operations during fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million of charges related to goodwill and equipment impairment  a million increase in a contingency reserve related to a vendor dispute that was resolved during fiscal  and million of severance charges associated with the reduction of the repair group s capacity for the repairing of components related to older generation aerospace turbine engines 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses of million  or of net sales  in fiscal were million less than the remaining million  or of net sales  of such expenses in fiscal the repair group s operating loss in fiscal decreased million to million from an million loss in fiscal included in the operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to the impairment of equipment and million of severance charges 
included in the operating loss in fiscal were charges aggregating million related to inventory write downs million  the impairment of goodwill million  and the impairment of equipment million  and the million of severance charges 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the repair group performed an evaluation of its existing operations in light of the anticipated impacts on its business of the september  terrorist attacks 
the principal result of this evaluation process was the decision to optimize the repair group s multiple operations by reducing certain of its capacity for the repairing of components related to older generation aerospace turbine engines  principally the jtd 
as a result of this decision  the repair group recognized  during fiscal  the aforementioned charges 
in addition  during fiscal  the repair group increased  by million  a contingency reserve related to the previously discussed vendor dispute 
the repair group s million operating loss  before the million of aforementioned impairment and severance charges  during fiscal is a decrease of million  when compared to the million operating loss  before the million of aforementioned impairment  severance  and contingency charges  during fiscal the reduced operating loss  before the aforementioned charges in both years  was primarily due to the positive impact on margins of a increase in fiscal fourth quarter sales volumes for both component manufacturing and repair services and replacement parts 
partially offsetting the positive impact of the repair group s increased sales volumes in fiscal was the negative impact on margins of reduced pricing for its products 
such downward pressure on pricing is expected to continue  the magnitude of which is difficult to predict at this time 
during fiscal  the euro had strengthened against the us dollar when compared to fiscal the repair group s non us operations have a significant portion of its operating costs denominated in euros and  therefore  as the euro strengthens  such costs are negatively impacted 
during the first nine months of fiscal  the repair group was able to hedge much of its exposure to the strengthening euro thereby mitigating the negative impact on its operating results 
had the repair group not hedged such exposure during the first nine months of fiscal  its operating loss would have been greater by approximately million during fiscal the impact on the repair group s operating results in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the period during which it did not hedge much of its exposure to the strengthening euro  was higher operating costs of approximately million related to its non us operations  when compared to the same fiscal period 
in an effort to curtail the repair group s operating losses  which stem primarily from its current excess capacity for component repairs  the company ceased operations at its tampa  florida turbine engine component repair facility during fiscal and continues to optimize its remaining turbine engine component repair capacity through consolidation of operations and other productivity improvement efforts 
the repair group is currently pursuing the sale of its tampa  florida facility 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of this discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft  and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for small aircraft were million in both fiscal and net sales of turbine engine components for smaller aircraft declined million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal million of the aforementioned net sales decrease is attributable to a decrease in net sales to rolls royce corporation consisting primarily of components for small turbine engines  such as the ae series latest generation turbine engines for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft 
net sales of non aerospace related products decreased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal certain of the acm group s products have both military and commercial aircraft applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components for military applications increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million 
the primary factor impacting the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses is a million reversal in fiscal of a charge that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal such charge was recorded in connection with an employment action and a related claim that was settled in favor of the company during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company had filed a claim against its insurance carrier for its failure to provide coverage 
see legal proceedings in item above 
selling  general and administrative expenses  before the impact of this legal contingency reserve  were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited by a reduction of million in the acm group s bad debt expense  compared with fiscal the acm group s operating income was million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were favorably impacted by the reversal of the million legal contingency accrual  while operating results in fiscal were unfavorably impacted by the establishment of such legal contingency accrual as discussed above 
operating income  before the impact of this legal contingency reserve  was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal operating results were favorably impacted in fiscal by a million decrease in variable tooling expenses and by a million decrease in outside services expense 
such decreases were primarily attributable to the acm group s efforts to reduce such expenditures and to perform the work in house 
as noted previously  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal benefited by a reduction of million in the acm group s bad debt expense  compared with fiscal these expense decreases were offset in part by a million increase in energy expenses 
the balance of the change in operating income is primarily attributable to the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal during fiscal  the acm group continued the cost containment and reduction actions initiated in fiscal to mitigate  in part  the impact of reduced revenues 
metal finishing group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical metal finishing equipment and solutions  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  contract service net sales decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal net sales to customers in the power generation  general manufacturing  and aerospace industries decreased approximately million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal due to overall weakness in these industries  compared with fiscal these net sales decreases were partially offset by an increase in net sales to customers in the automotive industry of approximately million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  attributable primarily to increased net sales from existing customers in this industry 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in both fiscal and  or and of net sales  respectively 
in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by a million increase in compensation expense and a million increase in legal and professional expense  compared with fiscal these increases were offset by a million decrease in employee incentive expense 
the metal finishing group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by a million increase in legal and professional expense 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in total employee incentive expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal the balance of the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing  selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted by lower corporate pension expense of million due to the decision in fiscal to cease the accrual of future benefits under a defined benefit pension plan 
lower legal and professional and consulting expenses also favorably impacted corporate unallocated expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal other general interest income was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the reduction of interest income is attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances outstanding and to lower interest rates available from short term investments during fiscal  compared with fiscal interest expense was million in both fiscal and term note interest expense decreased slightly in fiscal  compared with fiscal the decrease in the weighted average term note outstanding balance of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average interest rate payable under the term note in fiscal revolving credit agreement interest expense was comparable in both fiscal and the decrease in the interest rate payable under the revolving credit agreement was offset by an increase in the weighted average revolving credit agreement outstanding balance of million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the interest rate payable under the industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond decreased in fiscal  compared with fiscal the weighted average industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond outstanding balance during fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal foreign currency exchange loss was million in fiscal  compared with nil in the comparable period in fiscal this loss is the result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  resulting primarily from the decline in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro  on the company s monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in us dollars 
in fiscal  the income tax benefit related to the company s us and non us subsidiary losses was offset by a valuation allowance based upon an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
the modest tax benefit recognized in fiscal is attributable to the realization of a residual portion of fiscal s tax loss carryback in fiscal by one of the company s non us subsidiaries 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal  net sales decreased to million from million in net loss for the year ended september  was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group the repair group  which accounted for of the company s business in fiscal  had net sales of million  down from the million level in turbine engine component repair sales were down approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal demand for component repairs for virtually all models of large aerospace turbine engines  especially the older model jtd engines  was down in fiscal compared to fiscal the continued retirement and reduced utilization of older generation aircraft that negatively impacted the company in fiscal was accelerated exacerbated during fiscal as a direct consequence of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states  as many airlines chose to reduce capacity by retiring many of the older aircraft in their fleets 
in addition  the impact of the terrorist attacks on the commercial airline industry in general has also resulted in the reduced demand for turbine engine component repairs for the cfm general electric snecma  rb and tay both rolls royce engines due to reduced commercial flight demand  which determines the need for such repairs 
however  higher demand for component repairs for smaller aerospace turbine engines and industrial turbine engines partially offset the decline in demand for component repairs for the large aerospace turbine engines 
revenues associated with the demand for replacement parts  which complement turbine engine component repair services provided to customers  were down approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal due principally to the reduced component repair volumes in general 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in the million of selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million of charges related to goodwill and equipment impairments  million of restructuring charges  and a million increase in a reserve related to a vendor dispute 
the remaining million of selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal represented of net sales and reflected an million reduction in the repair group s provision for doubtful accounts  when compared to fiscal operating income loss in fiscal decreased million to an million loss from million of income in fiscal included in the decreased operating results for fiscal were charges aggregating million  million of which were incurred in the fourth quarter  related to the impairment of inventory million  the impairment of goodwill million  the impairment of equipment million  and the million of restructuring charges 
during fiscal  the repair group performed evaluations of its existing operations primarily in light of the current and anticipated impacts of the september  terrorist attacks on its business 
the principal result of these evaluation processes was the decision to optimize rationalize the repair group s multiple operations by reducing its capacity for the repair of certain turbine engine components  principally related to older generation jtd turbine engines  and the repair group s decision to optimize the size of its workforce 
as a result of these decisions  the repair group recognized  during fiscal  the aforementioned charges 
in addition  the repair group increased by million  the reserve related to a vendor dispute 
the remaining million decrease in operating results during fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the negative impact on margins of the significantly reduced sales volumes for turbine engine component repair services and related replacement parts 
the restructuring actions taken by the repair group in fiscal are expected to have a positive impact on fiscal operating costs when compared to fiscal the repair group will continue to evaluate the need for additional optimization rationalization of operations if and to the extent that the demand for turbine engine component repair services may not recover in the future 
aerospace component manufacturing group acm group net sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal for purposes of this discussion  the acm group considers aircraft that can accommodate less than passengers to be small aircraft  and those that can accommodate or more passengers to be large aircraft 
net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft decreased million in fiscal to million  compared with million in fiscal million of the aforementioned net sales decrease is attributable to a decrease in net sales to rolls royce corporation of which million is attributable to a reduction in selling prices and the balance consists of a decrease in net sales of primarily components for small turbine engines  such as the ae series latest generation turbine engines for business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  as a direct consequence of reduced flight schedules  cancellation of aircraft orders  workforce reductions and declining financial performance of the airline industry as a consequence of the september  terrorist attacks on the united states 
as a further consequence of the overall decline in the airline industry  net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of non aerospace related components in fiscal decreased approximately million 
these net sales decreases were partially offset by an increase in net sales of airframe components for small aircraft of million to million in  compared with million in fiscal certain of the acm group s products have both military and commercial aircraft applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components for military applications increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million 
the primary factor impacting the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal is a million charge incurred in connection with the settlement  during the second quarter of fiscal  of an employment action and a related claim that the company had filed against its insurance carrier for its failure to provide coverage 
selling  general and administrative expenses before this legal accrual was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were negatively impacted in fiscal by a million increase in the acm group s provision for doubtful accounts and a million increase in employee benefit expenses  offset by lower travel and other discretionary expenses 
the acm group s operating loss in fiscal was million  compared with operating income of million in fiscal the acm group s operating results in fiscal were impacted by the million legal accrual discussed above 
in fiscal  the acm group s operating income before legal accrual was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the acm group s operating results in fiscal were also negatively impacted by a million reduction in selling prices to rolls royce corporation  its largest customer  that was implemented during the first quarter of fiscal and is expected to affect future periods 
operating results were negatively impacted in by a million lifo provision  compared with a benefit in the remaining million decrease in operating income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to the negative impact on operating income of the reduced operating levels in operating results as a percentage of net sales was negatively impacted in fiscal by the interplay between overall lower net sales in relation to fixed manufacturing costs 
this was offset in part by lower material cost in due to product mix consisting of a greater percentage of products made from lower cost materials than in fiscal operating results also benefited from lower utilization of outside services  such as heat treating  as in house capabilities were sufficient to support such requirements 
during fiscal  the acm group took a number of actions  including a salary freeze  cutbacks in discretionary spending and other cost containment and cost reduction actions  to mitigate  in part  the impact of significantly reduced revenues 
metal finishing group net sales were million in both fiscal and in fiscal product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical finishing equipment and solutions  declined to million  compared with million in fiscal product net sales continued the decline that began in the first quarter of fiscal due to the overall weakness in most markets served by the metal finishing group  including aerospace  power generation  petroleum  steel  and railroad industries 
in fiscal  contract service net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal overall  declines in net sales to commercial customers were offset by increased sales to military customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in both fiscal and in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses benefited from lower advertising  travel and commissions expenditures  offset by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses 
the metal finishing group does not necessarily anticipate experiencing similar levels of expenditures for advertising and travel in future periods as economic conditions within the industries served by the metal finishing group improve 
the metal finishing group s operating income in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal operating income in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was negatively impacted by a shift in sales mix to higher contract service sales  which generate a lower margin than product sales 
additionally  a shift in the mix of contract service sales toward smaller contracts also negatively impacted operating results 
operating income in fiscal was also negatively impacted by additional fixed costs associated with a new service facility that opened in fiscal that has not reached full operating levels 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in both fiscal and corporate unallocated expenses were favorably impacted in by million of lower expenses related to management incentive and public company expenses 
during  additional staffing  employee benefit and general insurance expenses totaling million  partially offset the favorable decreases 
the decrease in management incentive expense is attributable to the financial performance of the company  while the decline in public company expenses is in part the result of the reduction in the size of the company s board of directors 
other general interest income was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the reduction in interest income is attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances outstanding and lower interest rates during  compared with interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is attributable to overall lower borrowings outstanding under the company s revolving credit agreement  as well as lower interest rates 
foreign currency exchange gain was minimal in fiscal  compared with a foreign currency exchange loss of million in fiscal effective october   the company changed the functional currency of its irish subsidiary from the local currency to the us dollar 
the functional currency was changed because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions are now denominated in us dollars 
other expense increased million in fiscal  compared with fiscal  as a result of a million provision recorded in to adjust the amount of the unamortized portion of deferred grant revenue for a possible future repayment obligation due to the company s recently reduced employment levels 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this provision was partially offset by an increase in the amount of nonrefundable research and other grants received during fiscal  compared with fiscal  as well as a one time gain from the sale of the acm group s interest in certain natural gas wells 
the company s fiscal income tax benefit of million consists primarily of anticipated tax refunds from the carry back of us and us operating losses 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a million valuation allowance against its net us deferred income tax assets  which were primarily recorded during the first three quarters of fiscal in assessing the company s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets  management considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its net deferred tax assets may not be realized 
management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income 
b 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september  from million at september  at present  essentially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents are in the possession of its non us subsidiaries and relate to undistributed earnings 
during fiscal  the company received a distribution of million from its non us subsidiaries 
this distribution was utilized to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the company s revolving credit agreement 
effective october   the company began to accrue us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its us subsidiaries in anticipation that distributions from such earnings  to the extent they may occur in the future  would result in an additional income tax liability 
distributions from the company s non us subsidiaries to the company may be subject to statutory restrictions  adverse tax consequences or other limitations 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal  which was a decrease of compared with million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to i a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher fourth quarter fiscal net sales  compared with fourth quarter fiscal net sales  and ii a net reduction in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities of million that is primarily attributable to a million reversal of the acm group s legal contingency accrual as a result of obtaining a favorable court ruling see legal proceedings in item above and a million payment of accrued severance 
this was partially offset by i an increase in accounts payable of million that is primarily attributable to the impact of extended payment terms negotiated with vendors during fiscal and ii income tax refunds of million received by the company during fiscal capital expenditures were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal consisted primarily of equipment to expand and diversify the repair group s repair capabilities  including heavy industrial turbine engine component repair 
at september   the company had outstanding commitments for capital expenditures totaling million 
the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will approximate million 
fiscal capital expenditures are anticipated to i provide increased range of manufacturing capabilities  ii automate certain machining operations  and iii enhance the company s service and repair capabilities 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering most of its employees 
during fiscal  the company s board of directors adopted a resolution to cease accrual of future benefits under one of its defined benefit pension plans  which covers substantially all non union employees of the company s us operations 
the plan will otherwise continue 
because the unrecognized actuarial loss exceeded the curtailment gain  there was no income or expense recognized in related to these changes 
in conjunction with the changes to the plan  the company made certain enhancements to the defined contribution plan that is available to substantially all non union employees of the company s us operations 
at september   the company has a year industrial development variable rate revenue bond outstanding  which was issued with an original face amount of million and was used to expand the repair group s tampa  florida facility 
the industrial development variable rate revenue bond requires annual principal payments ranging from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the interest rate is reset weekly based on prevailing tax exempt money market rates 
the interest rate at september  was 
the outstanding balance of the industrial development variable rate revenue bond at september  was million 
the bank s annual commitment fee on the standby letter of credit that collateralizes the industrial development bond is  of the outstanding balance 
the ceasing of operations at the tampa  florida facility in fiscal has no impact on the tax exempt status of the industrial development variable rate revenue bond 
the eventual sale of the facility may result in one of the following occurring i repayment of the industrial development variable rate revenue bond  ii continued servicing of the industrial development variable rate revenue bond by the company  or iii assumption of the industrial development variable rate revenue bond by the buyer of the facility 
the ultimate use of the facility determines  in part  which options maybe available 
at september   the company has a term note that is repayable in quarterly installments of million through february  with the remaining balance of million due may  the term note has a variable interest rate  which  after giving effect to an interest rate swap agreement  becomes an effective fixed rate term note  subject to adjustment based upon the level of certain financial ratios 
the effective fixed interest rate at september  was 
the interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount equal to the amount owed under the term note and bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the outstanding balance of the term note at september  was million 
at september   the company has a million revolving credit agreement  subject to sufficiency of collateral  that expires on september  and bears interest at the bank s base rate plus 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   the outstanding balance under the revolving credit agreement was million and the company had million available under its million revolving credit agreement 
all of the company s long term debt is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the us  a guarantee by its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the company s ownership interest in its non us subsidiaries 
under its credit agreements  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitations  covenants as defined that limit the amount of annual capital expenditures and require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level  a maximum liability to tangible net worth ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
during fiscal  the company entered into agreements with its bank to waive i the interest coverage ratio covenant for the period ended september  through the period ended december   ii the minimum tangible net worth covenant for the period ended september   and iii the capital expenditure limitation for the year ended september  on november   the company entered into an agreement with its bank to amend certain provisions of its credit agreements 
the amendment extends the maturity date of the company s million revolving credit agreement to march  the amendment waives and terminates all of the company s credit agreements financial covenants in their entirety 
new covenants are substituted for the terminated covenants minimum tangible net worth level and a minimum adjusted fixed charge coverage to ebitda ratio 
in addition  the definition of eligible collateral against which the company may borrow on its revolving credit agreement was amended 
taking into consideration the impact of this amendment  the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  the company believes that cash flow from its operations together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements through the end of fiscal year however  no assurances can be given as to the sufficiency of the company s working capital to support the company s operations 
if the existing cash reserves  cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving credit agreement are insufficient  if working capital requirements are greater than currently estimated  and or if the company is unable to satisfy the covenants set forth in its credit agreements  the company may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  restructuring indebtedness  selling assets or operations  or issuing additional shares of capital stock in the company 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be accomplished  or if so  on terms favorable to the company  or that they would enable the company to continue to satisfy its working capital requirements 
c 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement and that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
d 
other contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations  purchase obligations other long term liabilities total     excluded from the foregoing other contractual obligations table are open purchase orders at september  for raw materials and supplies required in the normal course of business 
e 
outlook the company s business continues to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as the aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the air transport industry s long term outlook has  for many years  been one of continued growth 
such outlook suggested the need for additional aircraft and growth in the requirement for aircraft and engine repairs 
the events of september  resulted in an immediate reduction in the demand for passenger travel both in the us and internationally 
aircraft manufacturers have announced reductions in forecasted aircraft deliveries in the next few years as a result of reduced demand  and many airlines cancelled or rescheduled deliveries of new aircraft to which they had previously committed 
in addition  the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world is weak 
the us airline industry has made requests for us government assistance  while some airlines have entered bankruptcy proceedings  and others have announced major restructuring initiatives  including significant reductions in service and grounding of aircraft 
this reduction in the demand for passenger travel and aircraft deliveries  and the increase in the number of idle aircraft  the number of which is skewed heavily toward older models  resulted in a decrease in orders and  therefore  negatively impacted the acm and repair groups net sales  operating results  and cash flows in fiscal this was due to the concentration of the acm group providing new parts for aircrafts and engines  and the repair group providing replacement parts and component repair services for the engines that power these aircraft 
declines in the commercial airline  aircraft and related engine industries have been partially offset by increases in us military spending for aircraft and related components 
the acm business supplies new and spare components for military aircraft 
increases in military component demand have partially offset the decreases in commercial aerospace component net sales 
it is difficult to determine at this time what the long term impact of these events will be on air travel and the demand for the services and products provided by the company 
these factors could result in a further decrease in orders for new and after market commercial aerospace products and services  an increase in credit risk associated with doing business with the financially troubled airlines and their suppliers  and an increase in slow moving and or obsolete replacement parts inventory related to older model engines that are experiencing reduced usage 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future 
f 
critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory on a part by part basis 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill the company at least annually reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company has a significant amount of property  plant and equipment 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves judgment 
the company believes that its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the impact of recognizing an impairment charge could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value 
further  actual results can differ significantly from assumptions used by the company in making its estimates 
future changes in the company s estimates could result in future impairment charges 
goodwill all of the company s net goodwill of million at september  is attributable to the company s metal finishing group 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment annually 
accounting standards require goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the segment 
if the fair value of the segment exceeds its book value  goodwill of the segment is not considered impaired 
to estimate the fair value of the metal finishing group  the company computed the segment s projected debt free cash flows related to future periods 
applying present value techniques to the debt free cash flow information the company estimated the fair value of the segment 
as a result  the company determined that the fair value of the metal finishing group exceeded its book value 
as a consequence  the company concluded that the metal finishing group s goodwill was not impaired at september  the company believes that its estimate of the metal finishing group s projected debt free cash flows is a critical accounting estimate because i it requires the company to make assumptions about future results and ii the impact of recognizing an impairment of goodwill could have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in projecting debt free cash flow  the company relied on internal budgets and forecasts 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimate of future debt free cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of future debt free cash flows and fair value could effect the valuations 
any increase in projected debt free cash flow beyond the amounts used in the impairment evaluation would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
however  if the company reduced its projections of debt free cash flow by  the resulting fair value of the metal finishing group would have been such that the company would have been required to recognize a goodwill impairment loss of approximately million 
valuation of deferred tax allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september   the company s net deferred tax asset before any valuation allowance was million 
at september   the income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis was offset by a valuation allowance of million based on an assessment of the company s ability to realize such benefits 
in assessing the company s ability to realize its net deferred tax assets  management considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
future reversal of the valuation allowance will be achieved either when the tax benefit is realized or when it has been determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized through future taxable income

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies primarily the euro  the payment in local currency  of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company believes that inflation has not materially affected its results of operations in  and does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in fiscal a 
foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations 
effective october   the company changed the functional currency of its irish subsidiary from the local currency to the us dollar 
the functional currency was changed because a substantial majority of the subsidiary s transactions are now denominated in us dollars 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s other non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in british pounds and the euro were as follows amounts in thousands british pounds euro cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable accounts payable  accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a term note  a revolving credit agreement and industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond 
these interest rate exposures are managed in part by an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate of the term note 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from september  rates  and assuming no changes in the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and industrial development variable rate demand revenue bond  annual interest expense to the company would increase or decrease million  respectively 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail
