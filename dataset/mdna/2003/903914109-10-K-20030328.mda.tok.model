item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and operating results of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 
except as otherwise indicated all amounts are expressed in us dollars 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs associated with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized to the company s cost centers 
such costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling both productive and non productive wells and overhead charges directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the company conducts operations in both the united states and china 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company has operations 
since its entry into the oil and gas industry in  the company has continued to raise capital for its exploration and development programs  most of which are based in the united states 
substantially all of the oil and gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  the amounts reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to an increase in the company s production offsetting a decline in the price received for that production 
during this period the company s production increased to bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate  up from bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate for the same period in this increase on a mcfe basis was attributable to the company s successful drilling activities during and during the year ended december  the average product prices were per mcf and per barrel  compared to per mcf and per barrel for the same period in production costs increased to million in from million in on a unit of production basis  costs were per mcfe in  as compared to per mcfe in production taxes in were million  compared to million in  or per mcfe in  compared to per mcfe in production taxes are calculated based on a percentage of revenue from production 
therefore  lower prices received reduced the cost on a per unit basis 
gathering fees for the period increased to million in from million in  attributable to higher production volumes and slightly higher gathering rates related to capacity constraints 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in on a unit basis  dd a increased slightly to per mcfe in  from per mcfe in primarily as a result of increases in future development costs relative to increases in the proved reserves used to calculate depletion of the full cost pool 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel and overhead expenses arising from the increases in activity on the wyoming properties 
stock compensation expense increased to million in from million in this increase is attributable to the increased number of shares granted and the share price at the time the stock was granted 
interest expense for the period increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the increase in borrowing under the senior credit facility 
interest and other income for the period decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a change in the way income from company owned well service equipment was accounted for and  secondarily  from lower interest received on balances in interest bearing accounts in deferred income taxes for the period increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in the tax rate due to the absence of book tax losses available to offset book taxable income as compared to the company was not liable for current payment of any material income taxes for the period ending december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was attributable to an increase in the company s production 
during this period the company s production increased to bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate  up from bcf of gas and thousand barrels of condensate for the same period in this increase on an mcfe basis was attributable to the company s successful drilling activities during and during the year ended december  the average product prices were per mcf and per barrel  compared to per mcf and per barrel for the same period in production costs increased to million in from million in and on a unit of production basis were per mcfe in  as compared to per mcfe in production taxes in were million  compared to million in  or per mcfe in  compared to per mcfe in production taxes are calculated based on a percentage of revenue from production 
therefore  higher production and the subsequent increase in revenue contributed to the increases 
gathering fees for the period increased to million in from million in  attributable to higher production volumes 
dd a expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in on a unit basis  dd a decreased to per mcfe in  from per mcfe in primarily as a result of increases in the proved reserves used to calculate depletion of the full cost pool 
general and administrative expenses increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increases in personnel and overhead expenses arising from the acquisition and operations of the china properties and increases in activity on the wyoming properties 
interest expense for the period increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to the increase in borrowings under the senior credit facility 
interest and other income for the period increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to increased utilization of company owned well service equipment and higher balances in interest bearing accounts in deferred income taxes for the period increased to million in from in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in pre tax net income relative to book net operating losses available to offset net income 
the company expects to book deferred taxes at the statutory rate in future periods 
the company was not liable for current payment of any material income taxes for the period ending december  on january   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of pendaries petroleum ltd  a new brunswick company  in exchange for  common shares of the company 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ending december   the company relied on its existing senior credit facility and cash provided by operations to finance its capital expenditures 
the company participated in the drilling of gross net wells in wyoming  gross net wells in the china blocks and one gross net well in texas 
for the twelve month period ending december  net capital expenditures were million 
at december   the company reported a cash position of million compared to million at december  working capital at december  was million as compared to million at december  as of december   the company had incurred bank indebtedness of million and other long term debt of million which was comprised of items payable in more than one year 
the positive cash provided by operating activities that the company continues to produce  along with the availability under the senior credit facility  are projected to be sufficient to fund the company s budgeted capital expenditures for  which are currently projected to be million 
of the million budget  the company plans to spend approximately million of its budget in wyoming and approximately million in china 
of the million for wyoming  the company plans to drill or participate in an estimated gross wells in  of which approximately will be for exploration wells and the remaining will be for development wells 
of the million budgeted for china  approximately will be for exploratory appraisal activity and the balance will be for development activity 
the company currently has no budget for acquisitions in as of march   the revolving senior credit facility provides for a million revolving credit line with a current borrowing base of million 
the credit facility matures on march  the notes bear interest at either bank one s prime rate plus a margin of one half of one percent to one and one quarter percent based on the percentage of available credit drawn or at libor plus a margin of one and one half percent to two and one quarter percent based on the percentage of available credit drawn 
an average annual commitment fee of is charged quarterly for any unused portion of the credit line 
the borrowing base is subject to periodic at least semi annual review and re determination by the banks and may be increased or decreased depending on a number of factors including the company s proved reserves and the bank s forecast of future oil and gas prices 
additionally  the company is subject to quarterly reviews of compliance with the covenants under the bank facility including minimum coverage ratios relating to interest  working capital  g a expenditures and advances to sino american energy 
in the event of a default under the covenants  the company may not be able to access funds otherwise available under the facility and may  in certain circumstances  be required to repay the credit facilities 
the notes are collateralized by a majority of the company s proved domestic oil and gas properties 
at december  the company had million of outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  with a current average interest rate of approximately 
the company was in compliance with all loan covenants at december  during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash flow from operations before changes in non cash working capital was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was attributable to the decrease in earnings and the decrease in net changes to non cash working capital items 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to increased drilling and completion activity in wyoming 
during the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to increased borrowing under the senior credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  after total long term debt   operating leases     total contractual obligations     the company s senior credit facility with its group of banks matures on march  unless the facility is extended or a new facility put into place  the full amount drawn under the facility would become due and payable at that time 
the company believes that it will be able to extend or renew the facility or one substantially similar to the existing facility prior to march  the company has signed a loi for its share of a year contract extensions up to years provided to lease a fpso 
the loi provides for the lease to be signed and come into force when and if the government of china approves the odp  which is expected during the first half of the fpso service agreement calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel processing fee that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed 
lease cancellation on the part of the company prior to the fpso starting offshore operations would commit the company to its share of up to million in cancellation fees 
the lease cancellation fee  after commencement of offshore operations  would be based on a sliding time scale cancellation fee decreases with time with of million the maximum cancellation fee 
the company considers it very unlikely that a lease cancellation situation will occur 
due to these terms of the lease  the company cannot estimate with any degree of accuracy the costs it may incur during the life of the lease 
additionally  in maintaining its acreage base that is not held by production  the company incurs certain expenses including delay rental costs 
from year to year  the company s acreage base varies  sometimes dramatically  rendering it impossible to forecast with any accuracy what the amount of these holding expenses will be 
in  total holding costs for all of the company s leases not held by production were  although the company projects that the positive cash provided by operating activities and the availability under the senior credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s budgeted capital expenditures for  future cash provided by operating activities and continued availability of financing are subject to a number of uncertainties beyond the company s control such as the price of gas and oil  production rates  continued results of the company s drilling program and the general condition of the capital markets for oil and gas companies 
there can be no assurances that adequate funding will be available to execute the company s planned future capital program 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  application of generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
use of estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  depreciation and amortization  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  or by independent petroleum engineers  are reviewed and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to uneconomic conditions 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  the oil and gas prices on the last day of the quarter significantly impact the calculation of the pv the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of the company s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
full cost method of accounting 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
a reserve is also provided for estimated future development costs related to proved reserves and for estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement and abandonment as a component of depletion expense 
the present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted using a prescribed discount rate pv 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserves are considered proved if they can be produced economically as demonstrated by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties  pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves the company excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
any impairment is transferred to the costs to be amortized 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give the company a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion  depreciation and amoritization expense would be reduced 
the following is a summary of major issues related to the company s ceiling test calculation 
the company did not have any writedowns related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million in the us the company s china properties have not yet been subject to a ceiling test  as there have not been any proved reserves booked to date 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation in the us and could result in a ceiling test writedown 
in china  the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  therefore  leasehold costs  seismic costs and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion and amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
as of december   costs related to these international projects of approximately million dollars were not being depleted pending determination of the existence of proved reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves  future development costs or future abandonment costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
the company accounts for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon its ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue is recorded based on volumes taken by the company or allocated to it by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than its ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates are adjusted to reflect any over produced or under produced positions 
receivables or payables are recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
at december   the company had taken approximately  mmcf more than its entitled share of production 
the estimated value of this imbalance of approximately million was recorded as a long term liability 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize its us net deferred tax asset at december   the company will need to generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carry forwards in to based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods  which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are reduced 
commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company periodically enters into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
the company primarily utilizes price swaps  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties of high credit quality that it believes are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon crude oil and natural gas futures  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices the company receives 
under sfas no 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company currently does not have any derivative contracts in place that do not qualify as a cash flow hedge 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
based on current estimates  the company would record asset retirement obligations using a discount rate and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on prior years  related to the depreciation and accretion expense that would have been reported had the fair value of the asset retirement obligation  and corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
currently the company s assessment has been deemed not material 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
also broadens the definition of discontinued operations to include all distinguishable components of an entity that will be eliminated from ongoing operations 
the company has adopted sfas no 
as of january  because the company has elected the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities  the impairment provisions of sfas no 
do not apply to the company s oil and gas assets  which are subject to ceiling limitations 
for the company s non oil and gas assets  the method of impairment assessment is unchanged from sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
statement  rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
was issued in april this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes 
as a result  the criteria in apb will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after january  the company expects adoption of this statement to result in the reclassification of losses on extinguishment of debt for all periods from extraordinary to other income and expense 
statement  accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 was issued in june sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas no 
will be effective for the company in january the company expects the adoption of sfas no 
to have no impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amended fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
have no material impact on the company  as it does not plan to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock options at the current time 
the company has included the required disclosures in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  as of march   the company had no guarantees  other than to wholly owned subsidiaries that are consolidated in place 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin or interpretation 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vie 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
the interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination 
this guidance applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  at this time  the company does not have any vies

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are included throughout this document 
the cautionary statements expressly qualify all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on the company s behalf 
competition 
the company competes with numerous other companies in virtually all facets of its business 
the competitors in development  exploration  acquisitions and production include the major oil companies as well as numerous independents  including many that have significantly greater resources 
therefore  competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases and evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than the financial or personnel resources of the company permit 
the ability of the company to increase reserves in the future will be dependent on its ability to select and acquire suitable prospects for future exploration and development 
the availability of a market for oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond the control of the company  including but not limited to the availability of other domestic or imported production  the locations and capacity of pipelines  and the effect of federal and state regulations on production 
historically  the company s projects have been financed through debt and internally generated cash flow 
there is competition for capital to finance oil and gas drilling 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing is uncertain and can be affected by numerous factors beyond its control 
the inability of the company to raise capital in the future could have an adverse effect on certain areas of the business 
marketing of oil and natural gas 
the ability to market oil and natural gas depends on numerous factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the availability of pipeline capacity  the effects of inclement weather  the demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users  the availability of alternative fuel sources  the proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines  state and federal regulations of oil and natural gas marketing  and federal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce 
because of these factors  the company may be unable to market all of the oil and natural gas that it produces  including oil and natural gas that may be produced from the bohai bay properties 
in addition  it may be unable to obtain favorable prices for the oil and natural gas it produces 
volatility of oil and gas prices 
prices for oil and gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond the company s control 
these factors include but are not limited to weather conditions in the united states  the condition of the united states economy  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  governmental regulation  political stability in the middle east and elsewhere  the foreign supply of oil and gas  the price of foreign oil and gas imports and the availability of alternate fuel sources and transportation interruption 
any substantial and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have an adverse effect on the carrying value of the company s proved reserves  borrowing capacity  the company s ability to obtain additional capital  and the company s revenues  profitability and cash flows from operations 
volatile oil and gas prices make it difficult to estimate the value of producing properties for acquisition and divestiture and often cause disruption in the market for oil and gas producing properties  as buyers and sellers have difficulty agreeing on such value 
price volatility also makes it difficult to budget for and project the return on acquisitions and development and exploitation projects 
price of wyoming production 
the company produces natural gas in wyoming 
the market price for this natural gas differs from the market indices for natural gas in the gulf coast region of the united states due potentially to insufficient pipeline capacity and or low demand in the summer months for natural gas in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
therefore  the effect of a price decrease may more adversely effect the price received for the company s wyoming production than production in the other us regions 
government regulations 
the company s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require that the company acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells  and require governmental approval of the overall development plan prior to start of development of fields in china 
under these laws and regulations  the company could be liable for personal injury and clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
the company maintains limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages  but does not maintain insurance coverage for the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages 
accordingly  the company may be subject to liability or may be required to cease production from properties in the event of environmental damages 
a significant percentage of the company s united states operations are conducted on federal lands 
these operations are subject to a variety of on site security regulations as well as other permits and authorizations issued by the blm  the wyoming department of environmental quality and other agencies 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that prohibit exploration  drilling and completing activities generally from november to may  but allow production activities all year round 
to drill wells in wyoming  the company is required to file an application for permit to drill with the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission 
drilling on acreage controlled by the federal government requires the filing of a similar application with the blm 
these permitting requirements may adversely affect the company s ability to complete its drilling program at the cost and in the time period currently anticipated 
on large scale projects  lessees may be required to perform environmental impact statements to assess the environmental impact of potential development  which can delay project implementation and or result in the imposition of the environmental restrictions that could have a material impact on cost or scope 
limited financial resources 
the company s ability to continue exploration and development of its properties and to replace reserves may be dependent upon its ability to continue to raise significant additional financing  including debt financing that may be significant  or obtain some other arrangements with industry partners in lieu of raising financing 
any arrangements that may be entered into could be expensive to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital in light of factors such as the market demand for its securities  the state of financial markets for independent oil companies including the markets for debt  oil and gas prices and general market conditions 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the company s capital budget 
the company expects to continue using its bank credit facility to borrow funds to supplement its available cash flow 
the amount the company may borrow under the credit facility may not exceed a borrowing base determined by the lenders based on their projections of the company s future production  future production costs and taxes  commodity prices and other factors 
the company cannot control the assumptions the lenders use to calculate the borrowing base 
the lenders may  without the company s consent  adjust the borrowing base at any time 
if the company s borrowings under the credit facility exceed the borrowing base  the lenders may require that the company repay the excess 
if this were to occur  the company may have to sell assets or seek financing from other sources 
the company can make no assurances that it would be successful in selling assets or arranging substitute financing 
for a description of the bank credit facility and its principal terms and conditions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
interruptions from severe weather 
the company s operations are conducted principally in the rocky mountain region 
the weather in this area can be extreme and can cause interruption in the company s exploration and production operations 
moreover  especially severe weather can result in damage to facilities entailing longer operational interruptions and significant capital investment 
likewise  the company s rocky mountain operations are subject to disruption from winter storms and severe cold  which can limit operations involving fluids and impair access to the company s facilities 
a portion of the company s acreage is affected by winter lease stipulations that restrict the period of time during which operations may be conducted on the leases 
the company s leases that are affected by the winter stipulations prohibit drilling and completing activities from mid november to mid may  but allow production activities all year round 
the company invests heavily in exploration 
the company has historically invested a significant portion of its capital budget in drilling exploratory wells in search of unproved oil and gas reserves 
the company cannot be certain that the exploratory wells it drills will be productive or that it will recover all or any portion of its investments 
in order to increase the chances for exploratory success  the company often invests in seismic or other geoscience data to assist it in identifying potential drilling objectives 
additionally  the cost of drilling  completing and testing exploratory wells is often uncertain at the time of the company s initial investment 
depending on complications encountered while drilling  the final cost of the well may significantly exceed that which the company originally estimated 
the company capitalizes all direct costs of drilling an unsuccessful exploratory well in the period in which the well is determined not to be producible in commercial quantities 
under the full cost method of accounting these costs are then depleted using the units of production method based on the company s proven reserves 
replacement of reserves 
the company s future success may depend on its ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
without successful exploration  development or acquisition activities  the company s reserves and production will decline 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
the oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including fire  explosion  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  and discharges of toxic gases 
the occurrence of any of these events with respect to any property operated or owned in whole or in part by the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company and the operators of its properties maintain insurance in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts that management believes to be reasonable 
however  insurance coverage is not always economically feasible and is not obtained to cover all types of operational risks 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
drilling and operating risks 
the company s oil and gas operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with drilling for  and production and transportation of  oil and gas 
these risks include the necessity of spending large amounts of money for identification and acquisition of properties and for drilling and completion of wells 
in the drilling of exploratory or development wells  failures and losses may occur before any deposits of oil or gas are found 
the presence of unanticipated pressure or irregularities in formations  blow outs or accidents may cause such activity to be unsuccessful  resulting in a loss of the company s investment in such activity 
if oil or gas is encountered  there can be no assurance that it can be produced in quantities sufficient to justify the cost of continuing such operations or that it can be marketed satisfactorily 
drilling plans subject to change 
this report includes certain descriptions of the company s future drilling plans with respect to its prospects 
a prospect is an area which the company s geoscientists have identified what they believe  based on available seismic and geological information  to be indications of hydrocarbons 
the company s prospects are in various stages of review 
whether or not the company ultimately drills a prospect may depend on the following factors receipt of additional seismic data or reprocessing of existing data  material changes in oil or gas prices  the costs and availability of drilling equipment  success or failure of wells drilled in similar formations or which would use the same production facilities  availability and cost of capital  changes in the estimates of costs to drill or complete wells  the approval of partners to participate in the drilling or  in the case of cnooc  approval of expenditures for budget purposes  the company s ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce exposure to costs and drilling risks  decisions of the company s joint working interest owners  and the blm s interpretation of the eis and the results of the permitting process 
the company will continue to gather data about its prospects  and it is possible that additional information may cause the company to alter its drilling schedule or determine that a prospect should not be pursued at all 
financial reporting impact of full cost method of accounting 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
a separate cost center is maintained for expenditures applicable to each country in which the company conducts exploration and or production activities 
under such method  the net book value of properties on a country by country basis  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed a calculated ceiling 
the ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties  discounted at per year 
in calculating discounted future net revenues  oil and gas prices in effect at the time of the calculation are held constant  except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts 
the net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis 
the excess  if any  of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an expense 
under sec full cost accounting rules  any write off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods 
future price decreases could result in reductions in the carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge to earnings 
risks arising from being non operator in bohai bay 
because the company is not the operator and holds a minority interest it cannot control the pace of exploration or development in the bohai bay properties or major decisions affecting drilling of wells or the plan for development and production  although contract provisions give the company certain consent rights in some matters 
kerr mcgee s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which the company spends money on this project 
if kerr mcgee were to shift its focus from this project  the pace of development of the blocks could slow down or stop altogether 
the company currently does not believe it has sufficient funds to purchase kerr mcgee s interests in these blocks if they were offered 
on the other hand  if kerr mcgee were to decide to accelerate development of this project  the company could be required to fund its share of costs at a faster pace than anticipated  which might exceed its ability to raise funds 
if  because of this  the company were unable to pay its share of costs  it could lose or be forced to sell its interest in the bohai bay properties or be forced to not participate in the exploration or development of specific prospects or fields on the blocks  potentially diminishing the value of its bohai bay assets 
political  economic or international factors affecting china 
ownership of property interests and production operations in areas outside the united states are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of expropriation  nationalization  war or insurrections  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities and quasi governmental agencies  change in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  labor problems  other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over its international operations  and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
tensions between china and its neighbors or various western countries  regional political or military disruption  changes in internal chinese leadership  social or political disruptions within china  a downturn in the chinese economy  or a change in chinese laws or attitudes toward foreign investment could make china an unfavorable environment in which to invest 
although all the foreign interest owners in the bohai bay properties have the right to sell production in the world market  the regulation of the concession by china  and the likely participation by cnooc as a large working interest owner  make chinese internal and external affairs important to the investment in the bohai bay 
if any of these negative events were to occur  it could lead to a decision that there is an intolerable level of risk in continuing with the investment  or the company may be unable to attract equity investors or lenders  or satisfy any then existing lenders 
in the event of a dispute arising from foreign operations  the company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of the courts in the united states or a potentially more favorable country 
in addition  the company s china pscs terminate after years of production  unless extended as provided for  which may be prior to the end of the productive life of the fields 
operating risks in china 
offshore operations  such as the company s bohai bay properties  are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and or loss from storms or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  the company could incur substantial liabilities that could result in financial losses or failures 
china has many regulations similar to those addressed in item i  environmental regulation that may expose the company to liability 
offshore projects  like the china field developments  are typically large  complex construction projects that are potentially subject to delays which may cause delays in achieving production and profitability

terms used to describe the company s interests in wells and acreage gross oil and gas wells or acres the company s gross wells or gross acres represent the total number of wells or acres in which the company owns a working interest 
net oil and gas wells or acres determined by multiplying gross oil and natural gas wells or acres by the working interest that the company owns in such wells or acres represented by the underlying properties 
terms used to assign a present value to the company s reserves standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  after income taxes the present value  discounted at  of the pre tax future net cash flows attributable to estimated net proved reserves 
the company calculates this amount by assuming that it will sell the oil and gas production attributable to the proved reserves estimated in its independent engineer s reserve report for the prices it received for the production on the date of the report  unless it had a contract to sell the production for a different price 
the company also assumes that the cost to produce the reserves will remain constant at the costs prevailing on the date of the report 
the assumed costs are subtracted from the assumed revenues resulting in a stream of future net cash flows 
estimated future income taxes using rates in effect on the date of the report are deducted from the net cash flow stream 
the after tax cash flows are discounted at to result in the standardized measure of the company s proved reserves 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the discounted present value of proved reserves is identical to the standardized measure  except that estimated future income taxes are not deducted in calculating future net cash flows 
the company discloses the discounted present value without deducting estimated income taxes to provide what it believes is a better basis for comparison of its reserves to the producers who may have different tax rates 
terms used to classify the company s reserve quantities the sec definition of proved oil and gas reserves  per article a of regulation s x  is as follows proved oil and gas reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
a reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
b reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
c estimates of proved reserves do not include the following oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
proved developed reserves proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
terms used to describe the legal ownership of the company s oil and gas properties working interest a real property interest entitling the owner to receive a specified percentage of the proceeds of the sale of oil and natural gas production or a percentage of the production  but requiring the owner of the working interest to bear the cost to explore for  develop and produce such oil and natural gas 
a working interest owner who owns a portion of the working interest may participate either as operator or by voting his percentage interest to approve or disapprove the appointment of an operator and drilling and other major activities in connection with the development and operation of a property 
terms used to describe seismic operations seismic data oil and gas companies use seismic data as their principal source of information to locate oil and gas deposits  both to aid in exploration for new deposits and to manage or enhance production from known reservoirs 
to gather seismic data  an energy source is used to send sound waves into the subsurface strata 
these waves are reflected back to the surface by underground formations  where they are detected by geophones which digitize and record the reflected waves 
computers are then used to process the raw data to develop an image of underground formations 
d seismic data d seismic survey data has been the standard acquisition technique used to image geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data is collected by a single line of energy sources which reflect seismic waves to a single line of geophones 
when processed  d seismic data produces an image of a single vertical plane of sub surface data 
d seismic data d seismic data is collected using a grid of energy sources  which are generally spread over several miles 
a d survey produces a three dimensional image of the subsurface geology by collecting seismic data along parallel lines and creating a cube of information that can be divided into various planes  thus improving visualization 
consequently  d seismic data is a more reliable indicator of potential oil and natural gas reservoirs in the area evaluated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to ultra s united states natural gas production 
historically  prices received for gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during realized wellhead prices are from the financial statements  and include the effects of hedging  receipt of deferred revenues from jonah gas gathering  and gas balancing between working interest owners 
the company periodically enters into various hedging arrangements for its natural gas production 
during  the company received payments from counterparties totaling  as its net proceeds from hedging activities 
this total includes  for the second quarter of   for the third quarter of  and  for the fourth quarter of at year end  the company had hedges in place covering approximately  mmbtu or approximately mmcf of gas per day for calendar at an average price of per mmbtu or approximately per mcf 
of these hedges  mmbtu are in the form of swaps and  mmbtu are fixed price forward sales at opal  wyoming 
the swaps are priced relative to the index price at the first of each month at opal  wyoming  where the company delivers most of its gas to the purchasers 
in the first quarter of  the company entered into additional swaps covering an additional  mmbtu or approximately mmcf of gas for the period from april  to october  at a price of per mmbtu or approximately per mcf pricing referenced to opal  plus an additional  mmbtu or approximately mmcf of gas per day for the same period at a price of per mmbtu or approximately per mcf pricing referenced to opal 
the table below summarizes the hedges in place as of march  type period volume price mmbtu fixed price sale calendar  swap calendar  swap calendar  swap april oct  swap april oct  these hedges represent approximately of the company s forecasted production for the period from april  to october   and approximately of the company s forecasted production for calendar
