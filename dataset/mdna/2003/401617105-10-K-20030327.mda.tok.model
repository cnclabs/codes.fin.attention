application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes and evaluation of net recoverable amounts and accruals for the sublet of certain lease obligations 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers  after a credit analysis based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collections trends and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to net sales  and are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these costs result from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historic trends and the evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out and weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving current product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of non current inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the company s individual product lines  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company periodically assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  and property and equipment which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or significant changes in its strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets 
if the assets are assessed to be recoverable  they are amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   the company did not record approximately million of goodwill amortization during fiscal  while a comparable amount was recorded in the fiscal period 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
seasonality our business is impacted by general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries 
our retail operations are generally stronger in the third and fourth quarters  while our wholesale operations generally experience stronger performance in the first and third quarters 
as the timing of the shipment of products may vary from year to year  the result for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year 
we have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations 
inflation we do not believe the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our net revenue or profitability 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our net revenue or profitability

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company receives united states dollars usd for substantially all product sales and licensing revenue 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in usd  however  purchase prices for products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the usd and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of goods in the future 
in addition  royalties received from international licensees are subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations as a result of the net sales of the licensee being denominated in local currency and royalties being paid to the company in usd 
during the last three fiscal years  exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material impact on inventory costs 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  to manage exchange risk on foreign currency transactions 
these financial instruments can be used to protect the company from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows from the foreign currency transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized periodically through the income statement or through stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
the classification depends on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  and if so  whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge 
generally  changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are matched in the income statement against the respective gain or loss relating to the hedged items 
changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective as hedges  are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss net of deferred taxes 
changes in fair values of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are currently reported in income 
the implementation of this standard did not have a significant impact on the financial statements

at december   of the company s indebtedness contained a fixed interest rate of 
substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness  including borrowings under its million credit facility  is at variable rates of interest
