item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
see note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in this annual report on form k 
overview during the periods encompassed by this annual report on form k  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our zadaxin clinical trials and our zadaxin commercialization activities 
we conduct our research and development efforts through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
in addition to internal management and staff  we rely upon arrangements with universities  other clinical research sites and contract research organizations for a significant portion of our product development efforts 
oversight of all external and collaborative programs is conducted by our executive officers and other staff from our headquarters located in san mateo  california 
from commencement of operations through december   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect our sales  gross margin and operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development  clinical testing and sales and marketing capabilities 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability is primarily dependent on the initiation  execution and completion of zadaxin clinical trials  securing regulatory approvals for zadaxin in additional countries  particularly in the us  europe  and japan  successfully launching zadaxin  if approved  in those countries  increasing zadaxin sales in approved markets  and developing and maintaining zadaxin corporate partnering arrangements in the us  europe  and japan 
in addition  other factors may also impact our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability  including manufacturing costs of zadaxin  our ability to obtain additional financing to support our operations  long term product development and commercialization programs  acquiring rights to additional drugs  and entering into and extending agreements for product development and commercialization  where appropriate 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and these fluctuations may be substantial as a result of  among other factors  the number  timing  costs and results of preclinical and clinical trials of our products  market acceptance of zadaxin and the timing of orders for zadaxin from international markets  particularly china  the regulatory approval process  the timing of fda or international regulatory approvals  and the acquisition of additional product rights and the funding  if any  provided as a result of corporate partnering arrangements 
setbacks or delays in the launch  sale or distribution of zadaxin  preclinical or clinical development of our products  the regulatory approval process or relationships with collaborative partners  and any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts  among other developments  in the past had  and could in the future have  an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
critical accounting policies general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the relevance of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on the part of the company 
sales to importing agents or distributors are recognized at time of shipment when title to the product is transferred to them  and they do not have contractual rights of return except under limited terms regarding product quality 
however  the company will replace products that have expired or are deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered 
payments by the importing agents and distributors are not contingent upon sale to the end user by the importing agents or distributors 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue associated with substantive performance milestones is recognized based on the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements and provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii there are no future performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
to date we have not recorded estimated reductions to revenue for expected sales returns as we have not experienced any sales returns 
if conditions become more competitive in any of the markets served by zadaxin or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to record product return estimates that would result in a reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for the year ended december   sales to six importing agents in china accounted for of the company s product sales and sales to four importing agents accounted for and of our product sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the largest customer accounted for of sales and the second largest customer accounted for of sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in in  the largest customer accounted for of sales and the second largest customer accounted for of sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in in  the largest customer accounted for of sales and the second largest customer accounted for of sales 
no other customers accounted for more than of sales in as of december   approximately  or  of our accounts receivable were attributable to four customers in china 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  and generally do not require collateral from our customers 
we maintain reserves for credit losses  and such losses have been within our expectations 
we recognize reserves for bad debts ranging from to of past due accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivables are past due and our collectibility experience 
inventories we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or realizable market value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in inventory reserves may be required in the future due to a change in market conditions 
impairment of intangible assets at december   we had net intangible assets of  related to zadaxin product rights and had never recorded any impairment losses related to intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
research and development expenses our phase clinical trials in the us will increase our research and development expenditures significantly over the next year 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous institutions that conduct the clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
expenses related to grants to the institutions are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
in general  these expenses will be higher for the initial and final months of a patient s scheduled months of treatment and observation 
expenses relating to the clinical research organization managing the trials and laboratory and other direct expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred and the services performed 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates accordingly  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could underestimate our actual research and development expenses 
results of operations product sales were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sales from to was primarily due to increased sales volume to our importing agents in china  whereas the greater sales in compared to was primarily due to a large sale of zadaxin to a new importer in china during the third quarter of for the year ended december   importing agents in china accounted for of our product sales and accounted for and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales emphasis is concentrated in china because  as one of our more developed markets  marketing expenditures can result in rapid benefits in sales and profits compared to newer markets which require investment and development spending 
we expect zadaxin sales to increase both in our existing approved markets and in new markets once regulatory approvals are secured and zadaxin is actively marketed 
the level of this sales increase is dependent upon increased zadaxin market penetration in our existing approved markets  additional zadaxin marketing approvals and the successful launch of zadaxin in new markets 
however  our primary corporate focus is the execution and funding of our phase clinical trials in the us because we are concentrating our resources on these efforts  we are focusing our international sales and marketing efforts on maintaining and developing sales in existing active markets rather than investing in the development of new markets 
although we remain optimistic regarding the prospects of zadaxin  we cannot assure that we will achieve sales increases  maintain existing sales levels  or that we will receive additional marketing indication approvals for zadaxin 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or any delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in additional future operating losses 
as part of our collaborative agreement with sigma tau  we received a  payment from sigma tau in january which is being recognized evenly as contract revenue over the period of our us hepatitis c clinical development activities  estimated to be three years beginning in the second quarter of cost of product sales was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect cost of product sales to vary from quarter to quarter  depending upon the level of zadaxin sales  the absorption of fixed product related costs  and any charges associated with excess or expiring finished product 
gross margin was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
gross profit margin was in  and we expect slight decreases in gross margin going forward in international markets including china  our largest and most mature market  should we maintain our product pricing and absorb any increases in product costs 
research and development expenses were   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in each year was primarily to support our zadaxin phase clinical trials in the us and japan 
in  and  research and development r d expenses represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total costs and expenses 
the major components of r d expenses consist of clinical studies performed by clinical trial institutions and contract research organizations  related materials and supplies  preclinical work  pharmaceutical development  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  third party research funding  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our research and development activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase   and clinical trials as well as expanded clinical access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
during  we recorded approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities 
this compares to expenses in of approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities and expenses in of approximately  on research   on clinical development  and  on pharmaceutical development activities 
the initiation and continuation of our clinical development programs has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our research and development expenses and is expected to require us to seek additional capital resources 
due to the uncertain nature of the clinical trial process  and enrollment rates in particular  it is not possible to determine the timing of completion or total cost expected to be incurred for each trial 
in general  we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years and to vary substantially from quarter to quarter as we pursue our strategy of initiating additional preclinical and clinical trials and testing  acquiring product rights  and expanding regulatory activities 
sales and marketing expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to was related to slightly lower promotional and advertising expenses 
the increase from to was related to increased payroll expenses and expenses for advertising and conferences associated with the expansion of our markets for zadaxin 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the next several quarters and years as we expand our commercialization and marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to was attributable to greater general and administrative activities to support an increased level of research and development on our late stage clinical programs 
in the near term  we expect general and administrative expenses to vary quarter to quarter as we increase our general and administrative activities and resources to support increased expenditures on preclinical and clinical trials and testing  and regulatory  pre commercialization and marketing activities 
income from payment on a note receivable from a former officer was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in july  the company loaned to the former officer  in exchange for a promissory note and the pledge of  shares of sciclone common stock as collateral for such loan 
during it was determined that the value of the collateral underlying the loan was more than temporarily impaired and that a writedown of the book value of the note would be required 
for accounting purposes  the company wrote off the entire remaining book value in a non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of under a new agreement in  the  shares of sciclone common stock held as collateral were retired and the value of these shares at that date was applied as a credit against the total indebtedness of the former officer 
after applying a credit for the retired stock of  the officer entered into a new note in the amount of  the note was fully repaid in the third quarter of interest and investment income was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease over the years was due to lower average invested cash balances and lower interest rates 
interest and investment expense was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase over the years was from the interest accrued on senior unsecured convertible notes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   and  we had   and  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the short term investments consist primarily of highly liquid marketable securities 
we have two letters of credit each secured by a certificate of deposit 
at december   the letters of credit total  one for  under our lease agreement  the other for  to facilitate our value added tax filings in europe 
net cash used in operating activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was less than the net loss primarily due to the receipt of a payment from sigma tau of  for a clinical trial collaboration which increased deferred revenue balances  increases in accounts payable  increases in accrued clinical trials expense and  decreases in inventories  partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses and accounts receivable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was greater than the net loss primarily due to a gain of  related to collection of a note receivable  which had previously been written off in  an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was greater than the net loss primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
these increases in were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash provided by investing activities of  for the year ended december  related to the net sale of  in short term investments and purchases of  in property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  related to the net purchases of  in short term investments and  in property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  related to the net purchases of  in short term investments partially offset by the purchases of  in property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  from a direct offering of common stock to institutional investors  approximately  related to exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans and  for the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of  in proceeds from the issuance of a convertible note   in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock   for granting an investor the right to purchase approximately  of senior unsecured convertible notes  and  from the payment on a note receivable from a former officer 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of approximately  from a private placement of common stock and warrants to institutional investors  approximately  from the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock by institutional and accredited investors  approximately  from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  approximately  from a private placement  approximately  from the exercises of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans   from the issuance of a convertible note   for granting investors the right to purchase approximately  of senior unsecured convertible notes and  from the payment on a note receivable from a former officer 
the following tables summarize our contractual cash obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years convertible notes payable operating leases minimum annual royalty obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period less than other commercial commitments total year years years after years letters of credit there are no officers or directors that were involved in related party transactions in we believe zadaxin product sales should continue to increase and remain a valuable source of capital generation 
the initiation and continuation of us clinical development programs  however  is expected to require additional funding either through equity or debt financing or from a collaborative partner 
the timing  achievement and sustainability of our operating profitability and capital requirements may change depending upon numerous factors  including the level of zadaxin product sales  the timing and amount of manufacturing costs related to zadaxin  the availability of complementary products  technologies and businesses  the initiation and continuation of preclinical and clinical trials and testing  particularly in the us  the timing of regulatory approvals  developments in relationships with existing or future collaborative partners and the status of competitive products 
without additional financing  or sales growth beyond our expectations  or a combination thereof  we believe our existing capital resources and interest on funds available are adequate to maintain our current and planned operations into we are actively reviewing alternatives for equity or debt financings and potential partnering activities 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately  which expire in the years through the difference between the cumulative losses for financial reporting purposes and federal income tax purposes is primarily attributable to losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which expire in the years through because of the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas in december sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been included in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the company has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information in this report on form k  before making an investment decision 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and operating results as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock 
our phase clinical trials in the us for the approval of zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha for the treatment of hepatitis c may fail  which will harm our business 
currently  there is no us fda approved therapy for hepatitis c patients who have failed to respond to prior therapy with interferon alpha plus ribavirin or with interferon alpha alone 
we designed our phase clinical trials based on the use of zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha to address this medical need 
there can be no assurances that the results from our previous hepatitis c studies with zadaxin and non pegylated interferon alpha which enabled us to produce this design will carryover to the trials involving a combination of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha and any resulting data may be insufficient or inadequate to demonstrate appropriate efficacy under fda guidelines 
in addition  insufficient data resulting from the clinical trials would also adversely affect our ability to market and sell zadaxin in markets where it is approved for sale 
in we began enrolling patients in both of the phase trials in our hepatitis c clinical program in the us  however  there are trials being conducted by competitors seeking to enroll similar patients and competition for appropriate patients for these clinical trials is significant 
we may not be able to enroll patients quickly enough to meet our timing expectations for completing the trial which would delay the preparation of a new drug application nda  or we may not be able to fully enroll the studies or patient drop out rates could be higher than anticipated  either of which could weaken the quality of an nda 
our hepatitis c clinical trials have been designed to show that the combination of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha adds a significant clinical benefit when compared to the use of pegylated interferon alpha alone in the re treatment of hepatitis c patients who have not responded to prior therapy 
however  the independent use of the pegylated form of interferon alpha may perform better than anticipated which could weaken the quality of an nda 
zadaxin has been used both clinically and commercially in thousands of patients without producing any reported zadaxin related significant side effects or toxicities  and the pegylated interferon alpha used in the clinical trials has been approved by the fda and has documented adverse side effects 
should the combination therapy of zadaxin and pegylated interferon alpha cause significant new or to a greater degree the same adverse side effects  our clinical trials could be delayed  patients may drop out at a greater than anticipated rate  we may be forced to halt the trials  or the fda may reject an nda due to safety issues 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our efforts to market and sell zadaxin will be impaired  our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
our phase clinical trials in japan for the approval of zadaxin for the treatment of hepatitis b may fail  which will harm our business 
there is a need for better hepatitis b therapies that improve efficacy and do not cause side effects 
our phase clinical trial was designed based on the use of zadaxin to address this medical need 
there can be no assurances that the results from our previous hepatitis b studies that enabled this design will carryover to the trials involving zadaxin and any resulting data may be insufficient or inadequate to demonstrate appropriate efficacy under japanese ministry of health guidelines 
in addition  insufficient data resulting from the clinical trial would also adversely affect our ability to market and sell zadaxin in markets where it is approved for sale 
we may not be able to compile and analyze trial data quickly enough to meet our timing expectations  which would delay the preparation of a japanese new drug application jnda 
our hepatitis b clinical trial was designed to show that zadaxin adds a significant clinical benefit in the treatment of hepatitis b patients 
although zadaxin has been used safely by over  patients to date  should zadaxin cause significant adverse side effects  our jnda could be delayed or the japanese ministry of health may reject our jnda on safety issues 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our efforts to market and sell zadaxin will be impaired  and our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
we rely on third parties to manufacture our clinical trial product 
deficiencies in their work could delay or harm our trials or the approval process and harm our business 
we manufacture the zadaxin used in our phase trials under cgmp guidelines and under our direct manufacturing and quality control using third party cgmp manufacturers and suppliers 
if unanticipated deficiencies in these manufacturers or suppliers occur  this could create a delay in the assembling of a timely and acceptable nda 
not all of the zadaxin planned to be used in our hepatitis c clinical trials has been manufactured and received 
pegylated interferon alpha is being supplied to us by roche on an as needed basis 
any delay in receiving or recall of pegylated interferon alpha or zadaxin could delay the clinical trials or detract from the integrity of the trial data 
if any of the foregoing occurs  our efforts to market and sell zadaxin in combination with pegylated interferon alpha will be impaired  our business will suffer and the price of our stock may decline 
we may not be able to successfully develop or commercialize our products 
many of our products are in the development stage and will require the commitment of substantial resources  devoted to extensive research  development  preclinical testing  clinical trials  manufacturing scale up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale 
we cannot assure you that commercially viable products will result from these efforts 
we face significant technological risks inherent in developing these products 
we may also abandon some or all of our proposed products before they become commercially viable 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials and we rely  in part  on third parties  particularly clinical research organizations and our development partners  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties may result in delays in completing  or failure to complete  these clinical trials if third parties fail to fulfill their obligations to us 
if any of our products  even if developed and approved  cannot be successfully commercialized in a timely manner  our business will be harmed and the price of our stock may decline 
we have not yet sold any product other than zadaxin 
we have experienced difficulties with the formulation of cpx which has delayed its further development 
our future revenue growth depends on increased market acceptance and commercialization of zadaxin in additional countries  particularly in the us  europe and japan 
if we fail to successfully market zadaxin  or if we cannot commercialize this drug in the us and other additional markets  our revenue and operating results will suffer 
our future revenue will also depend in part on our ability to develop other commercially viable and accepted products  however  until we obtain additional resources  substantially all of our resources are focused on the development of zadaxin 
market acceptance of our products will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective customers and prospective strategic partners that our products are an attractive alternative to other treatments and therapies  and manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost 
failure to do so will hurt our operations 
if we fail to satisfy and comply with governmental regulations or if government regulations change  our business may suffer 
all new drugs  including our products  which have been developed or are under development  are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the fda  and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries 
these regulations govern  among other things  the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  pre market approval  importation  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
these regulations change from time to time and new regulations may be adopted 
for example  in prior years  legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would restrict the duration of the marketing exclusivity of an orphan drug 
there can be no assurances that this type of legislation will not be reintroduced and passed into law  or that the benefits of the existing statute will remain in effect 
our failure to satisfy and comply with regulations adopted by the fda  and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries  may delay or stop approval of our drugs 
in particular  such failure can  among other things  result in warning letters  fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls or seizures  operating restrictions  injunctions  total or partial suspension of production  civil penalties  and criminal prosecutions 
furthermore  additional government regulation may be established or imposed by legislation or otherwise  which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of zadaxin or any of our other future products 
adverse events related to our products in any of our existing or future markets could cause regulatory authorities to withdraw market approval for such products  if any  or prevent us from receiving market approval in the future 
there is no assurance that zadaxin  or any of our other products  will demonstrate efficacy sufficient to obtain approval by the fda or its counterpart regulatory agencies in other indications or countries 
satisfaction of government regulations may take several years and the time needed to satisfy them varies substantially  based on the type  complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product 
as a result  government regulation may cause us to delay the introduction of  or prevent us from marketing  our existing or potential products for a considerable period of time and to impose costly procedures upon our activities 
if regulatory approval of our products is granted  such approval may impose limitations on the indicated uses for which our products may be marketed 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in countries where we have targeted regulatory approval  we may not be able to sustain or increase our revenues and our stock price may decline 
the research  preclinical and clinical development  manufacturing  marketing and sale of zadaxin and our other drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
zadaxin and any other products we may sell in countries outside the us must be approved by the foreign counterparts of the fda before they can be sold in any jurisdiction 
obtaining regulatory approval is time consuming and expensive 
in some countries where we are contemplating marketing and selling zadaxin  the regulatory approval process for drugs that have not been previously approved in countries with established clinical trial review procedures is uncertain  and this may delay or prevent the grant of regulatory approvals for zadaxin 
in addition  to secure these regulatory approvals  we will need  among other things  to demonstrate favorable results from additional clinical trials of zadaxin 
even if we are able to complete the clinical trials we have sponsored or are planning in a timely or cost effective manner  these trials may not fulfill the applicable regulatory approval criteria  in which case we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval in these countries 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approvals in our targeted countries in a timely and cost effective manner or at all 
our failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals so that we can develop  market and sell our products in countries where we currently do not have such rights will limit our revenues 
in addition  adverse results that occur in our clinical trials could result in restrictions on the use of zadaxin  which may also hurt our business 
we will need to obtain additional capital to support our long term product development and commercialization programs 
our ability to achieve and sustain operating profitability depends in large part on our ability to commence  execute and complete clinical programs for  and obtain additional regulatory approvals for zadaxin and other drug candidates  particularly in the us  europe and japan  increase zadaxin sales in existing markets  and launch zadaxin in new markets 
we cannot assure that we will ever achieve more significant levels of sales or that we will receive additional zadaxin market approvals 
our current sales levels of zadaxin are not expected to generate all the funds we anticipate will be needed to support our current plans for product development including our us phase clinical trials for zadaxin 
we will need to obtain additional financing to support our product development and commercialization programs 
we may seek additional funds through public and private stock offerings  arrangements with corporate partners  borrowings under lease lines of credit or other sources 
if we cannot raise the necessary funds  we will have to reduce our capital expenditures  curtail or delay our phase clinical trials  scale back our development of new products  reduce our workforce and out license to others products or technologies that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves  any of which may harm our business and cause our stock price to fall 
the amount of capital we will need will depend on many factors  including the timing  location  scope and results of ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost of manufacturing or obtaining preclinical and clinical materials  the timing and cost involved in applying for and obtaining fda and international regulatory approvals  whether we elect to establish additional partnering arrangements for development  sales  manufacturing  and marketing of our products  the level of future zadaxin sales  expense levels for our international sales and marketing efforts  our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements for development  sales  manufacturing and marketing of our products  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  whether any or all of our outstanding convertible notes are converted to common stock  and whether any or all of our outstanding common stock warrants are exercised and the timing and amount of these exercises 
many of the foregoing factors are not within our control 
if we need to raise additional funds and such funds are not available on reasonable terms  we may be required to delay or cancel our product development and commercialization programs 
any additional equity financing will be dilutive to shareholders  and any debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
we have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and may never achieve profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we plan to dedicate substantially all of our resources to expanding our development  testing and marketing capabilities  particularly in the us  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve profitability may cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue is dependent on the sale of zadaxin in foreign countries  particularly china  and if we experience difficulties in our foreign sales efforts  our financial condition will be harmed 
our product revenue in the near term is highly dependent on the sale of zadaxin in foreign countries 
if we experience difficulties in our foreign sales efforts  our business will suffer and our financial condition will be harmed 
substantially all of our zadaxin sales are to customers in china 
sales of zadaxin in china may be limited due to its low average personal income  lack of patient cost reimbursement  poorly developed infrastructure  and existing and potential competition from other products  including generics 
we are currently in the process of renewing our importation permit to allow us to continue to sell our product to the importers in china 
our business would be severely harmed if we were unable to renew the permit or if the renewal process were prolonged and we were not granted an exemption to make periodic shipments into china 
in china zadaxin is sold as an imported finished product 
the attractiveness of the zadaxin market has encouraged local companies to introduce lower priced locally manufactured generic competitive products 
as this occurs  there could be a negative impact on the price and the volume of zadaxin sold to this country and this would harm our business 
in addition  our zadaxin sales and operations in other parts of asia  as well as in latin america and the middle east  are subject to a number of risks  including difficulties and delays in obtaining pricing approvals and reimbursement  product health registrations and importation permits  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  long payment cycles  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in enforcing our proprietary rights  currency fluctuations  adverse or deteriorating economic conditions  and potential adverse tax consequences 
we do not have product sales in the us with which to offset any decrease in our revenue from zadaxin sales in asia  latin america and the middle east 
in addition  some countries in these regions  including china  regulate pharmaceutical prices and pharmaceutical importation 
these regulations may reduce prices for zadaxin to levels significantly below those that would prevail in an unregulated market  limit the volume of product which may be imported and sold  or place high import duties on the product  any of which may limit the growth of our revenues or cause them to decline 
because of china s tiered method of importing and distributing finished pharmaceutical products  our quarterly results may vary substantially from one period to the next 
china uses a tiered method to import and distribute finished pharmaceutical products 
at each port of entry  and prior to moving the product forward to the distributors  government licensed importing agents must process and evaluate each shipment to determine whether such shipment satisfies china s quality assurance requirements 
in order to efficiently manage this process  the importing agents place relatively few orders from time to time over any six month period and each order is typically for large quantities 
therefore  our sales to an importing agent can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the size and timing of the orders  which has in the past and may in the future cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
because we use a small number of importing agents in china  our account receivable from any one importing agent is material and if we were unable to collect receivables from any importer  our business and cash flow would be adversely affected  at least in the short term 
we have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  which may adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products 
we currently have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and we anticipate that we will be relying on third party collaborators to sell  market and distribute our products for the foreseeable future 
if our arrangements with these third parties are not successful  or if we are unable to enter into additional third party arrangements  we may need to substantially expand our sales  marketing and distribution force 
our efforts to expand may not succeed  or we may lack sufficient resources to expand in a timely manner  either of which will harm our operating results 
in addition  if we are able to further expand our sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  we will begin competing with other companies that have experienced and well funded operations 
if we cannot successfully compete with these larger companies  our revenues may not grow and our business may suffer 
if we are not able to establish and maintain adequate manufacturing and supply relationships  the development and sale of our products could be impaired 
to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
we may not be able to maintain the long term manufacturing relationships we currently have with our suppliers and we anticipate changes will be needed if our volume requirements increase 
manufacturing interruptions could significantly delay clinical development of potential products and reduce third party or clinical researcher interest and support of proposed trials 
these interruptions could also impede commercialization of our products  including sales of zadaxin in approved markets  and impair our competitive position 
any of these developments would harm our business 
in some countries  a manufacturing change may require additional regulatory approvals 
if we do not obtain the required regulatory approvals for a manufacturing change in a timely fashion  new zadaxin marketing approvals may be delayed or sales may be interrupted until the manufacturing change is approved 
either of these results would harm our business 
in addition  manufacturing  supply and quality control problems may arise as we  either alone or with subcontractors  attempt to scale up our manufacturing procedures 
we may not be able to scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  either of which could cause delays or pose a threat to the ultimate commercialization of our products and harm our business 
if we do not obtain rights to additional products from third parties  our prospects for future revenue may decline 
the clinical development of zadaxin is our primary product development objective  however  if we do not devote additional resources to cpx or advance scv and dax  the other products to which we have in licensed rights  from preclinical into clinical development  we may lose the rights to these products 
we may also have a shortage of drugs to develop and commercialize if we do not license or otherwise acquire rights to additional drugs 
any shortage in the number of drugs that we are able to develop and commercialize may reduce our prospects for future revenue 
commercialization of some of our products depends on collaborations with others 
if our collaborators are not successful  or if we are unable to find future collaborators  we may not be able to properly develop and commercialize our products 
we depend in part on our distributors and business partners to develop and or promote our drugs  and if they are not successful in their efforts or fail to do so  our business will suffer 
we generally do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that our business partners devote to zadaxin and they have not always performed as or when expected 
if they do not perform their obligations as we expect  particularly obligations regarding clinical trials  our development expenses would increase and the development and or sale of our products could be limited or delayed  which could hurt our business and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  our relationships with these companies may not be successful 
disputes may arise over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators  and we may not be able to negotiate similar additional arrangements in the future to develop and commercialize zadaxin or other products 
if we fail to protect our products  technologies and trade secrets  we may not be able to successfully use  manufacture  market or sell our products  or we may fail to advance or maintain our competitive position 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products and technologies  to preserve our trade secrets and to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the future 
our patents or patent applications may not have priority over others applications 
our existing patents and additional patents  if any  that may be issued may not provide a competitive advantage to us or may be invalidated or circumvented by our competitors 
others may independently develop similar products or design around patents issued or licensed to us 
patents issued to  or patent applications filed by  other companies could harm our ability to use  manufacture  market or sell our products or maintain our competitive position with respect to our products 
although many of our patents relating to zadaxin have expired  we have rights to other patents and patent applications relating to zadaxin under exclusive licenses 
if we breach the terms of any of these licenses  we could lose our rights to these patents and patent applications 
our commercial success also depends in part on us not infringing valid  enforceable patents or proprietary rights of third parties  and not breaching any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of third party patents that may relate to our products 
it is possible that we may unintentionally infringe these patents or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may in the future receive notices claiming infringement from third parties as well as invitations to take licenses under third party patents 
any legal action against us or our collaborative partners claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products and processes affected by third party rights may require us or our collaborative partners to obtain licenses in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
our efforts to defend against any of these claims  even if unmeritorious  would require us to devote resources and attention that could have been directed to our operations and growth plans 
in addition  these actions may subject us to potential liability for damages 
we or our collaborative partners may not prevail in a patent action and any license required under a patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
pharmaceuticals are either not patentable or have only recently become patentable in some of the countries in which we have exclusive rights to zadaxin 
past enforcement of intellectual property rights in many of these countries has been limited or non existent 
future enforcement of patents and proprietary rights in many other countries will likely be problematic or unpredictable 
moreover  the issuance of a patent in one country does not assure the issuance of a similar patent in another country 
claim interpretation and infringement laws vary by nation  so the extent of any patent protection is uncertain and may vary in different jurisdictions 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may never realize the anticipated benefits 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may attempt to acquire products  product candidates or businesses that we believe fit strategically with our business 
we currently have no commitments or agreements with respect to material acquisitions 
if we do undertake any transaction of this sort  the process of integrating an acquired product  product candidate or business may result in operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for our ongoing business development plans 
moreover  we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
future acquisitions could result in in process research and development expenses  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization or impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may lose market share or otherwise fail to compete effectively in the intensely competitive biopharmaceutical industry 
competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and we expect that competition to increase 
our success depends on our ability to compete 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this industry include the efficacy  safety  price  therapeutic regimen  manufacturing quality assurance  and patents associated with a given drug 
our competitors include biopharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities and other research institutions  both in the us and abroad  that are actively engaged in research and development of products in the therapeutic areas we are pursuing  particularly hepatitis c  hepatitis b  and cancer 
competitors are currently marketing drugs for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and cancer  or have products in late stage clinical trials 
most of our competitors  particularly large biopharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater financial  technical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and human resource capabilities than we do 
most of them also have extensive experience in undertaking the preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market drugs 
additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors 
where comparable products are marketed by other companies  price is a competitive factor 
increased competitive pressure could lead to intensified price based competition resulting in lower prices and margins  which would hurt our operating results 
we currently rely on sales of zadaxin outside of the us as a treatment for hepatitis c and hepatitis b and certain cancers as our primary source of product revenue 
several large biopharmaceutical companies have substantial commitments to interferon alpha  an approved drug for treating hepatitis b and hepatitis c  and to lamivudine and adefovir  approved drugs to treat hepatitis b 
we cannot assure you that we will compete successfully against our competitors or that our competitors  or potential competitors  will not develop drugs or other treatments for hepatitis c  hepatitis b  cancer  and other diseases that will be superior to ours 
in the us  our product zadaxin is being evaluated in combination with pegylated interferon alpha for the treatment of hepatitis c patients who have failed to respond to prior therapy with interferon alpha plus ribavirin or with interferon alpha alone 
other companies are researching  developing  or marketing other products for use alone or in combination with interferon alphas or pegylated interferon alphas for clinical indications including hcv and hbv 
such competitive products include ribavirin  allegedly improved ribavirin molecules and other products not yet in late stage clinical trials such as therapeutic vaccines and reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
our clinical trials may not show zadaxin to have advantages over such existing or future competitive products nor to have clinically significant synergistic value 
we believe that we can position zadaxin as a complementary rather than competitive drug to many therapies  but cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor 
we expect continuing advancements in and increasing awareness of the use of immune system enhancer therapy to fight cancer and infectious diseases and that this development may create new competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete with any such competitors 
if third party reimbursement is not available or patients cannot otherwise pay for zadaxin  we may not be able to successfully market zadaxin 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products may depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement to patients for our products will be available from government health care programs  private health insurers and other third party payors or organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of new therapeutic products  such as zadaxin  and we cannot assure you that third party insurance coverage and reimbursement will be available for therapeutic products we might develop 
in most of the emerging markets in which we sell zadaxin or intend to sell zadaxin  reimbursement for zadaxin under government or private health insurance programs is not yet widely available 
the failure to obtain third party reimbursement for our products  particularly in the us  europe and japan  will harm our business 
in the us  proposed health care reforms could limit the amount of third party reimbursement available for our products 
we cannot assure you that additional limitations will not be imposed in the future on drug coverage and reimbursement 
in many emerging markets where we have marketing rights to zadaxin  government resources and per capita income may be so low that our products will be prohibitively expensive 
in these countries  we may not be able to market our products on economically favorable terms  if at all 
efforts by governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce health care costs could cause us to reduce the prices at which we market our drugs  which will reduce our gross margins and may harm our business 
various governments and third party payors are trying to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect that there will continue to be a number of legislative proposals to implement government controls 
the announcement of proposals or reforms could cause us to reduce the prices at which we market our drugs  which will reduce our gross margins and may harm our business 
if the current economic slowdown in the us causes the economies of other countries  particularly those in asia  latin america and the middle east to experience a slowdown or recession  our business will suffer 
the us is the world s largest consumer and as such  the current economic slowdown in the us may adversely affect the economies of other countries  including the developing countries in asia  latin america and the middle east from which we derive essentially all of our revenues 
if the economic conditions in the us continue or worsen  these developing countries may also experience an economic slowdown or recession  which would likely result in a decrease of sales of zadaxin 
any decrease in sales of zadaxin would harm our operating results  delay our efforts to achieve profitability  and likely cause our stock price to decline 
the current geopolitical situation in the middle east and other countries may cause our business to suffer 
if the current geopolitical conditions in the middle east and north korea continue or worsen resulting global developments would likely result in a decrease of sales of zadaxin 
any decrease in sales of zadaxin would harm our operating results  delay our efforts to achieve profitability  and likely cause our stock price to decline 
if the current war on terrorism causes economic slowdowns in the economies of or business disruptions in certain countries our business will suffer 
the united states and its allied nations are aggressively attacking terrorism with military and economic actions 
if these actions lead to economic slowdowns in the economies of developing countries in asia  latin america and the middle east from which we currently derive essentially all of our product revenue  then our sales could decrease 
in addition  our commercial product is manufactured in europe and distributed by us from our operations in hong kong 
any disruption of our supply and distribution activities due to war or acts of terrorism could decrease our sales 
any decrease in sales would harm our operating results  delay our efforts to achieve profitability  and likely cause our stock price to decline 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional  highly skilled personnel required for the expansion of our activities  our business will suffer 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel because of the specialized  scientific and international nature of our business 
there is intense competition for qualified management  scientific and technical personnel in the pharmaceutical industry  and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to grow and develop our business globally 
in addition  numerous key responsibilities at sciclone are assigned to a small number of individuals 
if we were unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed or promptly replace those employees who are critical to our product development and commercialization  the development and commercialization of our products would be adversely affected 
at this time  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and our insurance may be inadequate to cover damages 
clinical trials or marketing of any of our current and potential products may expose us to liability claims from the use of these products 
we currently carry product liability insurance 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms for clinical and commercial activities or that the insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall 
if we fail to have sufficient coverage  our business  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue or expense fluctuations  affect our reported or future results of operations or impact our reported or future financial position 
a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or financial position or the way we conduct our business 
specifically  legislative and other proposals could result in changes to accounting rules requiring us to account for employee stock options issued at market value as an expense 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results 
compliance with legislative actions and changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses including higher insurance costs 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules  are creating increased requirements for companies such as ours and there may be additional regulatory rulings and changes 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in addition  insurers have increased rates as a result of higher claims rates over the past year and may increase rates in future years 
our rates for our various insurance policies have increased significantly and may increase further in future years 
if we are unable to comply with environmental laws and regulations  our business may be harmed 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products 
we currently maintain a supply of hazardous materials at our facilities 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for any damages that result  and the liability could exceed our resources 
while we outsource our research and development programs involving the controlled use of biohazardous materials  if in the future we conduct these programs ourselves  we might be required to incur significant cost to comply with the environmental laws and regulations 
the price of our common stock has experienced substantial volatility and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control 
us and global economies have weakened due to the effects and uncertainties caused by the events of september which may result in a decrease in our revenues and cause our stock price to decline 
further  high profile corporate governance and accounting problems and resulting corporate failures have eroded investor confidence 
in the wake of these events  us and global capital markets have experienced a period of extreme volatility  and this may continue for some time 
in addition  there has been significant volatility in the market prices for publicly traded shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours 
the following factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock significant negative changes in the major equity market indices  announcements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors  governmental regulation  health care legislation  public announcements regarding advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting  public announcements from government officials relating to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries  patent or proprietary rights developments  changes in third party reimbursement policies for our products  and fluctuations in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that the price of our common stock will remain at or exceed current levels 
our indebtedness may result in future liquidity problems 
as of december   we had  in convertible notes payable   of which were issued in the quarter ended december  and  in the quarter ended march  this indebtedness  or additional debt we may incur to fund our operations  may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing 
the outstanding notes are payable five years after issuance unless converted into common stock at the sole discretion of the holder 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result which would negatively impact our future prospects 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  substantial sales of our stock or convertible securities may impact the market price of our common stock 
as of december   stock options for  shares of common stock were outstanding  of which options for  shares were exercisable 
also outstanding as of the same date were warrants exercisable for  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share   of which were cancelled in january  and two issues of notes convertible into a total of  shares of common stock 
in addition  the note holder has the right to purchase senior unsecured convertible notes due december and march if issued  the additional notes will bear no interest zero coupon and will be convertible into  shares of our common stock 
upon exercise of options or warrants  or conversion of the notes  these issued shares of common stock will be freely tradable 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
similarly  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock  the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall 
issuing preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock could adversely affect holders of common stock 
our charter documents give our board of directors the authority to issue series of preferred stock without a vote or action by our shareholders 
the board also has the authority to determine the terms of preferred stock  including price  preferences and voting rights 
the rights of holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights granted to holders of preferred stock 
for example  a series of preferred stock may be granted the right to receive a liquidation preference a pre set distribution in the event of a liquidation that would reduce the amount available for distribution to holders of common stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
as a result  common shareholders could be prevented from participating in transactions that would offer an optimal price for their shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest solely in us treasury or us government agency notes 
our investments in these notes are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term notes and maintain an average maturity of less than one year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in fair value of our available for sale securities 
this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
substantially all our sales and manufacturing costs to date have been in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
