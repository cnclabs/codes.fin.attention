item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and resultsof operations critical accounting policies several of the company s accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable and the recovery value of obsolete or overstocked inventory 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped based on its terms of fob shipping point  where risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer at time of shipment 
the company records sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when all of the following exist persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
provisions are made currently for estimated product returns and sales allowances 
allowances for sales returns  doubtful accounts and other 
sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  uncollectible accounts receivable and other customer related allowances 
management analyzes historical returns and bad debt expense  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and sell through of our products when evaluating the adequacy of these allowances 
in addition  the company may provide warehousing credits and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  budgeted customer allowances and existing commitments to customers 
although management believes it has established adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
at august   trade accounts receivable balance was 
million  net of allowances of  and factor advances of  as compared to a balance of million net of allowances of  and factor advances of  at august  inventory 
the company marks down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about age of the inventory  future demand and market conditions 
this process provides for a new basis for the inventory until it is sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory markdowns may be required 
the company s inventory balance was million  net of inventory markdowns of  at august   as compared to an inventory balance of million  net of inventory markdowns of  at august  results of operations years ended august  and net sales for the fiscal year ended august  decreased approximately million or compared to the fiscal year ended august  due to a decrease in unit sales in both the company s sleepwear and western wear product lines  resulting from the general slowdown in the economy continued from fiscal furthermore  cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased by  leading to a decline in gross profit margin from to between fiscal and this decrease came as a result of lower realized gross margins across all product lines 
the company s product mix constantly changes to reflect customer mix  fashion trends and changing seasons 
consequently  gross margins are likely to vary on a quarter to quarter basis and in comparison to gross margins generated in prior fiscal years 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to increased sales commission expenses as a result of the company s sales mix shifting from non commissioned sleepwear sales to commissioned menswear sales 
on a percent of net sales basis  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in sales volume as well as the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
management continually monitors expense levels and strives to maintain streamlined operations while making investments intended to generate optimal sales performance 
interest expense increased  for the current year to  as compared to  for the year ended august  this slight increase was due to increased advances made under the company s factoring agreement  which were required because of reduced cash flow due to lower turnover in the company s accounts receivable 
years ended august  and net sales for the fiscal year ended august  decreased approximately million or compared to the fiscal year ended august  due to a decrease in unit sales in both the company s sleepwear and western wear product lines  as a result of the general slowdown in the economy continued from fiscal furthermore  cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased by  leading to a decline in gross profit margin from to between fiscal and this decrease came as a result of lower realized gross margins across all product lines 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in dollar amount from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to reductions in salaries and commissions as a result of lower sales volume 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net sales from in fiscal to in fiscal  due primarily to the disproportionate decrease in sales when compared to the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense decreased  for fiscal to  as compared to  for fiscal this decrease was due primarily to interest rate savings resulting from reductions in the company s borrowing rate

designer intimates had acquired nap from its founders and obtained a credit line of approximately million from hsbc  secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of nap and the guarantees of shareholders of designer intimates 
nitches guaranteed million of this credit line and this guarantee formed the consideration from nitches for its ownership interest in designer intimates 
in the event of a call on this guarantee by hsbc  nitches has a contract with the remaining shareholders of designer intimates to limit nitches exposure to of the called value 
nitches reports any income or loss from the ongoing operation of designer intimates using the equity method of accounting  whereby nitches interest in designer intimates is reported as a single line item on the consolidated statement of income 
for october through august  the company recognized a loss of  from the unconsolidated subsidiary 
this loss is a non cash loss and does not provide a tax benefit to the company 
for that same period  designer intimates had lost  on sales of million 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased to million at august  as compared to million at august   due primarily to the decrease in sales and a corresponding decrease in accounts receivable in excess of the decrease in current liabilities 
however  the company s current ratio increased to at august  from at august   due to the higher proportional decrease in current liabilities 
the company sells substantially all of its trade receivables to a factor hsbc on a pre approved  non recourse basis 
the company attempts to make any recourse shipments on a cod basis or ensure that the customers payments are backed by a commercial or standby letter of credit issued by the customers bank 
the amount of the company s receivables which were recourse and were not made on a cod basis or supported by commercial or standby letters of credit at august  was approximately  of which approximately  has been collected through october  payment for non recourse factored receivables is made at the time customers make payment to hsbc or  if a customer is financially unable to make payment  within approximately days of the invoice due date 
under the factoring agreement  the company can request advances in anticipation of customer collections at hsbc s prime rate currently less one and one half percent 
the amount of advances available to the company is limited to eighty five percent of non recourse factored receivables 
the company may also issue letters of credit through hsbc for the purchase of inventory in the normal course of its operations 
letters of credit are subjected to a limit of million 
at august   the company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million for the purchase of finished goods  which had been opened through hsbc 
the factoring agreement does not contain any financial covenants to which the company must adhere 
advances are collateralized by all of the assets of the company as well as a million personal guaranty from the company s chairman 
the factoring agreement can be terminated by hsbc on days written notice

during fiscal  the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share 
during fiscal  the company declared and paid cash dividends of per share 
however  the company does not have a stated dividend policy

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of august  payments due commitments expiring per period total less than over committed year years years years operating leases    letters of credit   guarantees   total obligations commitments    inventory in its ordinary course of operations  the company generally makes some sales below its normal selling prices or below cost 
based on experience  management believes this will be true for some inventory held on or acquired after august  the amount of such sales depends on several factors  including general economic conditions  market conditions within the apparel industry  the desirability of the styles held in inventory and competitive pressures from other garment suppliers 
the company s inventory decreased from million at august  to million at august  the company has established an inventory markdown reserve as of august   which management believes will be sufficient for current inventory that is expected to be sold below cost in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize its expected selling prices or that the inventory markdown reserve will be adequate for items in inventory as of august  for which customer sales orders have not yet been received 
the inventory markdown reserve is calculated based on specific identification of aged goods and styles that are slow moving or selling off price 
impact of exchange rates while the company purchased over of its products from foreign manufacturers in fiscal  all of its purchases are denominated in united states dollars 
because the company s products are sold primarily in the united states in dollar denominated transactions  the company does not engage in currency hedging to reduce currency risk 
a prolonged increase in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies could enhance the company s purchasing power for new purchase orders and reduce its cost of goods sold 
conversely  a prolonged decrease in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies could result in an increase in the company s cost of manufacturing for new purchase orders and costs of goods sold 
impact of inflation and deflation management does not believe that inflation has had any material impact upon the company s revenues or income from operations to date 
management believes that the apparel sector in which the company operates has been in a period of deflation  contrary to the modest inflation experienced in the economy in general 
the persistence of the consumer to buy on sale merchandise has put pressure on retail gross margins  which in turn has led to downward pressure from retailers on wholesale gross margins  in the form of selling cost adjustments taken as deductions against invoices issued by the company 
in the apparel industry  these are commonly referred to as markdown allowances or chargebacks 
the company experienced a doubling of these allowances in fiscal to million  contributing to the operating loss incurred 
without a corresponding decrease in fabric and labor prices  these markdown allowances have led to a decline in wholesale gross margins 
management believes these deflationary pressures will continue into the foreseeable future 
future operating results business conditions in the apparel sector continue to be characterized by weak consumer demand and heavy discounting of merchandise by retailers 
the continuing conflict in iraq  coupled with the ongoing uncertainty of the overall economy has led most retailers to use significant discounting to encourage sales 
in general  retailers have to sell more units in order to achieve sales equal to last year 
the company does not expect significant improvement in business conditions in the apparel sector for the upcoming fiscal year 
with these uncertainties  the company is approaching fiscal with caution and conservatism 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates
