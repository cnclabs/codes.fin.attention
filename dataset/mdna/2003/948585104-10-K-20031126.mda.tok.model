outlook issues and uncertainties the market for the company s products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market  will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and remain competitive 
if the company is unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  the company s business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
wci competes with companies that have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with technology partners and original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers  the company has positioned itself to provide end to end solutions to its customers 
competition in the market for the company s mpeg broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance and price 
the company s broadcast digital video products in production are competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
the compel network control system meets customer needs by providing regionalization of receiver control and spot advertisement 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
the company believes it has positioned itself to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of its product and market strategies  which have proven successful in increasing revenues from this sector 
in the cable television market the company believes that the competitive position for many of its products is strong 
however  the unity product family competes with significant and established firms 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including the company s digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
the company believes that its continued success in all of its markets will depend on aggressive marketing and product development 
the demand for digital products is being driven by the high cost of satellite capacity and increasing demand for video and multi media content 
the digital conversion of major networks is expected to continue  but it remains difficult to predict the precise timing and number of customers converting to digital 
management believes the market as a whole has considerable built up demand for digital technology 
although no assurances can be given  the company expects to directly benefit from this increase in demand 
there may be fluctuations in the company s revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by the company 
the company has invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
the company purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
the company s inventory reserve of  at august   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should the company s sales efforts not be successful 
sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of the company s revenues  and that trend is expected to continue throughout fiscal and beyond 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  future revenues may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
one customer accounted for of the backlog at august  and for of the backlog scheduled to ship during fiscal the company s gross margin percentage is subject to variations based on the product mix sold in any period and on sales volumes 
start up costs associated with new product introductions could adversely impact costs and future margins 
the company is very focused on controlling both direct and indirect manufacturing costs and other operating expenses 
these costs will be adjusted as necessary if revenues do not increase as planned 
management believes that digital compression technology may be profitably employed to create increased demand for its satellite receiving equipment if those products are manufactured in a high volume  standardized production environment 
certain raw materials  video sub components and licensed video processing technologies used in existing and future products are currently available from single or limited sources 
although the company believes that all single source components are currently available in adequate quantities  there can be no assurance that shortages or unanticipated delivery interruptions will not develop in the future 
any disruption or termination of supply of certain single source components or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company has made significant investments in capitalized software principally related to digital audio and video products 
at august   capitalized software costs were  these costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives 
the industry in which the company operates is subject to rapid technological advances and frequent product introductions 
the company expects to remain committed to research and development expenditures as required to compete effectively and maintain pace with the rapid technological changes in the communications industry and to support innovative engineering and design in its future products
