the current economic environment in the company s markets has the potential to adversely impact its liquidity in a variety of ways  including through reduced sales  potential inventory buildup  or higher operating costs 
the principal products that the company sells are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes 
although the current market prices of these commodities are favorable  a decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
in addition  international sales represent approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal a disruption in international sales  a decline in commodities prices  or a rise in energy prices  resulting from the threat of military action or war with iraq and the attendant political instability  has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
there can be no assurance  however  that a decline in commodities prices  or a rise in energy prices  a slowdown in the us or international economy  or other factors  including the threat of military conflict in the middle east and the macroeconomic effects of those events  will not cause the company to fail to meet management s expectations  or otherwise result in liquidity concerns 
page critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions which may deviate from actual results 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding the fair value of the company s reporting units in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  estimates regarding future undiscounted cash flows from the future use of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  estimates regarding the net realizable value of long lived assets held for sale  estimates regarding pension expense  estimates of bad debts and estimates regarding self insured risks including insurance  environmental and litigation contingencies 
in assessing impairment of goodwill  the company uses estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units 
in assessing the impairment of long lived assets where there has been a change in circumstances indicating the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  the company has estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from use of the asset based on actual historical results and expectations about future economic circumstances including future business volume  finished product prices and operating costs 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units and of future net cash flows from use of the asset could change if actual prices and costs differ due to industry conditions or other factors affecting the level of business volume or the company s performance 
in assessing impairment of long lived assets held for sale  the company has estimated the net realizable value of such assets based on information from various external sources regarding possible selling prices for such assets 
the estimate of reserve for bad debts is based upon the company s bad debt experience  market conditions  aging of trade accounts receivable  and interest rates  among other factors 
pension expense is based upon actuarial estimates 
these estimates could change based on changes in market conditions  interest rates  and other factors 
in estimating liabilities for self insured risks  the company considers information from outside consultants and experts  and past historical experience  in projecting future costs expected to be incurred 
these estimates could change if future events are different than assumed by management  actual costs to settle the liabilities differ from those estimated and the circumstances associated with the self insured risks change
