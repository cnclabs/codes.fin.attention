item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements certain statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are also identified by words such as expects  anticipates  believes  intends  plans  projects  or similar expressions 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risk factors described in the risk factors set forth in item critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles and goodwill  accrual of bonus and profit sharing estimates  accrual of income tax liability estimates and accounting for stock based compensation 
management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is established or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue  other than for contract research and development  for all business segments is recognized from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
the company performs research and development under contract agreements with customers based on cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursable or fixed fee terms 
these contracts generally require the company to produce and provide developmental materials and or products to those customers 
revenues from cost plus fixed fee and cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
we follow the guidelines of statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for our fixed fee contracts 
revenue and profits on each fixed fee contract are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue and profits are recognized throughout the performance period of the contract 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
the estimated total cost for each contract is periodically reevaluated and revised  when necessary  throughout the life of the contract 
losses on contracts are recorded in full when identified 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts and a warranty reserve based on historical experience and believe the collection of revenues  net of these reserves  is reasonably assured 
the allowance is an estimate for potential non collection of accounts receivable based on historical experience 
the company has not experienced a non collection of accounts receivable materially affecting its financial position or results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
the company records a warranty reserve as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of revenues utilizing actual returns over the last twelve months 
if actual returns are not consistent with the historical data used to calculate these estimates  net revenues and accounts receivable could be misstated 
the company records a slow moving inventory reserve as a charge against earnings for all products on hand that have not been sold to customers in the past twelve months 
an additional reserve is recorded for product on hand that is in excess of product sold to customers over the past twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company tests goodwill on at least an annual basis for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of other intangible assets and whether goodwill is impaired involves judgments based upon long term projections of future performance 
a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the fair value of the reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
based on the results of the most recently completed analysis  the company s goodwill was not impaired as of june  no event has occurred as of or for the period ended june  that would give management an indication that an impairment charge was necessary that would adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company records bonus and profit sharing estimates as a charge against earnings based on a formula percentage of the company s operating income 
these estimates are adjusted to actual based on final results of operations achieved during the fiscal year 
partial bonus amounts are paid quarterly based on interim company performance  and the remainder is paid after fiscal year end and final determination of the applicable percentage 
other bonuses and profit sharing are paid annually 
the company records an estimated income tax liability to recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
judgment is required in estimating the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or the income tax returns 
the company uses the intrinsic value approach specified in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  for stock options granted to officers and key employees  and therefore does not record compensation costs based upon the fair value of options at the date of grant 
see notes a and k to the company s consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  estimated accruals are recorded as a charge against earnings based on known circumstances where it is probable that a liability has been incurred or is expected to be incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net earnings net earnings increased in fiscal to million per share diluted from million per share diluted in fiscal the major contributor to the net earnings increase was the strong worldwide demand for commercial infrared optics and component products in the industrial sector 
earnings increases also resulted from a variety of factors  including improved production efficiencies  savings achieved through the consolidation of infrared optics operations  increased external research and development funding and reduced interest expense 
bookings bookings increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of bookings outpacing shipments in fiscal manufacturing orders comprised approximately of the backlog at june  manufacturing bookings increased by approximately million while contract research and development bookings increased by approximately million 
the bookings growth was primarily attributable to stronger market demand in the infrared optics market and higher external research and development funding for single crystal sic development efforts 
bookings are defined as customer orders received that are expected to be converted to revenues over the next months 
for long term customer orders  the company does not include in bookings the portion of the customer order that is beyond months due to the inherent uncertainty of an order that far out in the future 
revenues revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million last fiscal year 
the revenue growth reflects the general strength of our product offering and  more specifically  strong demand in our infrared optics business 
the increase in revenues for fiscal compared to the same period last fiscal year is primarily due to stronger shipments of commercial infrared optics to both oem and aftermarket customers and the integration of the company s sales and marketing distribution activity in germany through a new consolidated subsidiary  ii vi lot  see note b of the company s consolidated financial statements 
segment earnings segment earnings  which is defined as earnings before income taxes  interest and other income or expense  for fiscal increased to million compared to million for the same period last fiscal year primarily due to higher gross margins from improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost controls in the infrared optics segment and higher sales volume from all businesses with the exception of the ev products division 
improvement in segment earnings was experienced in the infrared and near infrared optics segments which was partially offset by lower segment earnings in the military infrared optics segment and the company s other category primarily comprised of our ev products division and wide band gap wbg group 
segment earnings is a non gaap financial measure and differs from income from operations in that segment earnings excludes certain operational expenses included in other expense net as reported 
management believes segment earnings to be a useful measure because it reflects the results of segment performance over which management has direct control 
bookings  revenues and segment earnings or loss for the company s reportable segments are discussed below 
certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with the segment reporting presentation adopted in fiscal see also note l to the company s consolidated financial statements 
infrared optics bookings for fiscal for infrared optics increased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
the improvement was due to overall increases in order volume from oem and aftermarket customers worldwide 
the bookings growth was also attributable to the receipt of single and multi year orders from domestic and international oem customers that had been delayed from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  the oem manufacturers of both high power  multi kilowatt lasers for cutting  welding  drilling and heat treating applications and lower power lasers for engraving and marking requested products at a rate more consistent with fiscal business levels explaining the increase in order bookings over the same period last fiscal year 
revenues for fiscal for infrared optics increased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased shipments to several of the company s domestic and international oem customers  as well as  increased shipments to aftermarket customers 
stronger order intake has translated into stronger revenues for the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
segment earnings for fiscal increased to million compared to million for the same period last fiscal year 
the improvement in segment earnings for the current fiscal year as compared to the last fiscal year was due to a combination of increased sales volume  a full year impact of operational consolidation of the commercial infrared optics operations from laser power corporation and the acquisition of a majority interest in a distributor in germany 
near infrared optics bookings for fiscal for near infrared optics increased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
the increase in bookings for fiscal as compared to the last fiscal year was primarily due to stronger demand in commercial bookings in the optics and crystal product lines used in defense and medical applications 
revenues for fiscal for near infrared optics were million compared to million last fiscal year 
commercial revenues increased as compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily in the optics and crystal product lines offset by a decrease in contract revenues from the winding down of the multi year yttrium aluminum garnet yag contract 
segment earnings for fiscal increased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
this improvement reflected overall stronger gross margins and improved product yields 
cost reductions particularly in the materials area as a result of yield improvements were sufficient to increase gross margins despite the essentially flat revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal military infrared optics bookings for fiscal for military infrared optics decreased to million from million last fiscal year 
the reduction in bookings is primarily due to the delay of the production portion of a customer order for sapphire based products and the receipt of a six month order for javelin missile domes in fiscal as compared to a twelve month order received in the previous fiscal year 
revenues for fiscal for military infrared optics increased to million compared to million last fiscal year 
revenues from a contract for the air borne laser abl and increased shipments of sapphire based products were the major contributors to the increase as compared to the last fiscal year 
military infrared optics experienced a million segment loss in fiscal year compared to segment earnings of million last fiscal year 
during the fiscal year changes in contract estimated costs to complete relating primarily to a development contract resulted in million of additional expenses 
additionally  the consolidation of the commercial operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year from laser power corporation to other ii vi facilities decreased gross margins in the remaining military infrared optics business segment due to the absorption of costs previously allocated to the infrared optics segment 
other the company s other segment includes the combined operations of the company s ev products division and wbg group and the company s corporate research and development group 
combined bookings for fiscal for ev products division and wbg group increased to million as compared to million last fiscal year 
the increase was due to the receipt of more externally funded contract support for wbg s efforts in silicon carbide sic development and the initial customer orders for sic substrates 
this increase in bookings for wbg group was partially offset by a decrease in bookings for ev products division due to slow development and deployment of new products by existing and target customers for medical and industrial applications 
revenues for fiscal from these operations increased to million compared to million last fiscal year 
the higher revenues are a direct result of the higher contract billings  particularly contract research and development of the wbg group 
the segment loss for fiscal of million increased from the segment loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the segment loss was primarily attributable to weakness in demand for products from ev products division 
this loss was partially offset by more external contract support of the company s efforts in sic  which offsets the funding needed to be provided by the company for this activity 
costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin  which is defined as net sales less cost of goods sold  for fiscal was million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues last fiscal year 
the increased sales volume for fiscal year as compared to last fiscal year  the operational consolidation late last fiscal year of the infrared optics commercial manufacturing that was previously done at laser power corporation in california to other worldwide manufacturing sites  the acquisition of a majority interest in a distributor in germany  ii vi lot gmbh and lower material costs as a result of yield improvements all contributed to the increased gross margin 
contract research and development gross margin  which is calculated as contract research and development revenues less expenses  for fiscal was million of research and development revenues  compared to a gross margin of million of research and development revenues  for the same period last fiscal year 
the contract research and development revenues and costs are a result of development efforts in the near infrared optics and the military infrared optics segments as well as activities in the ev products division and the wbg group for the fiscal year ended june  the increased revenues level for fiscal as compared to last fiscal year is primarily due to revenues from a new sic development contract 
contract research and development gross margin is a result of a blend of cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursement and fixed fee contract activities 
the reduced gross margin for fiscal was due primarily to losses of approximately million recognized from activities performed on a fixed price percentage of completion development contract in the military infrared optics segment 
company funded internal research and development expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues  for last fiscal year 
the lower expense is a direct result of more external contract support of the company s wbg group s efforts in sic crystal growth technology and processing development which offsets the funding needed to be provided by the company for this activity 
fiscal included the results of the former litton systems  inc silicon carbide group from the acquisition date  however the company did not have a commensurate level of contract revenues in fiscal to offset the wbg group s additional costs associated with this business 
company funded internal research and development expenses also include corporate research and development activities in addition to the research and development activities of the ev products division 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for last fiscal year 
the dollar and percentage increases for fiscal year as compared to last fiscal year reflect costs associated with the acquisition of a majority interest in a distributor in germany  ii vi lot gmbh during the first quarter of this fiscal year see note b to the company s consolidated financial statements 
while this acquisition has increased the company s direct selling expense by approximately of sales as compared to the prior year  this expense increase has been offset by the additional gross margin on sales to end customers in germany 
in addition to this acquisition of ii vi lot  the company recorded higher salary expenses as compared to last fiscal year for its world wide profit driven bonus program 
interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for last fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense reflects lower libor based interest rates  as well as a reduction in debt levels of the company at june  as compared to the same period last fiscal year 
other expense for fiscal was million compared to million for last fiscal year 
other expense in was primarily due to the minority interest in ii vi lot  the million write off of an investment in the second quarter of the current fiscal year and foreign currency losses as a result of the us dollar s performance relative to other currencies in the current fiscal year offset by royalty income and interest income 
other expense in fiscal related to the closing of operations of laser power corporation in mexico of million  costs related to consolidating several of the company s european distribution arrangements of million  and the write off of certain crystal growth equipment and technology of million offset by foreign currency gains  royalty income and interest income 
the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective income tax rate of for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate reflects the completion of an annual external transfer pricing study and the resulting finalization of the allocation of profits around the world 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects the company s continued benefit from lower tax rates on its singapore and china operations and a favorable mix of us and foreign income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net earnings net earnings decreased in fiscal to million per share diluted from million per share diluted in fiscal the major contributor to the net earnings decrease was the general softening of demand for infrared laser optics and component products and solid state x ray and gamma ray detection materials and products in the industrial sector impacted by the weak worldwide economy 
bookings bookings decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal order backlog increased to million at june  from million at june  as a result of bookings outpacing shipments in fiscal the increase in backlog is primarily due to strong second half bookings  more specifically large orders recorded by significant military orders booked at laser power corporation  blanket orders recorded by ev products division and contract bookings for the development of silicon carbide 
manufacturing orders comprised of the backlog at june  manufacturing bookings decreased by approximately million while contract research and development bookings increased by approximately million 
the bookings decrease was primarily a result of order delays caused by a slowdown in the industrial sector 
revenues revenues decreased to million in fiscal compared to million last fiscal year 
revenues decreased due to lower shipments compared to the same period last fiscal year of industrial laser oem and aftermarket sales from sluggish industrial worldwide demand and from the absence in sales of radiation detection materials and products to replace the fiscal year sales volume primarily in the medical sector 
segment earnings segment earnings  which is defined as earnings before income taxes  interest and other income or expense  for fiscal decreased to million compared to million for the same period last fiscal year primarily due to lower gross margins from lower sales volume from the majority of our businesses 
the decrease in segment earnings was also caused by a shift in the product mix away from the slowed industrial business and towards the military business which historically has lower margins 
bookings  revenues and segment earnings or loss for the company s reportable segments are discussed below 
certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with the segment reporting presentation adopted in fiscal see note l to the company s consolidated financial statements 
infrared optics bookings for fiscal for infrared optics decreased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily driven by delays in oem and aftermarket orders caused by a slowdown in the industrial sector 
revenues for fiscal for infrared optics decreased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased shipments to several of the company s domestic and international oem customers  as well as  decreased shipments to aftermarket customers 
segment earnings for fiscal increased to million compared to million for the same period last fiscal year 
the reduction in segment earnings for the current fiscal year as compared to the last fiscal year was due to a decrease in sales volume from softer demand for infrared optics  particularly in the industrial sector 
near infrared optics bookings for fiscal for near infrared optics decreased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
the decrease in bookings for fiscal as compared to the last fiscal year was primarily due to weaker demand in commercial bookings in the optics and telecommunications product lines partially offset by an increase in contract research and development bookings 
revenues for fiscal for near infrared optics decreased to million compared to million last fiscal year 
commercial revenues decreased as compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily in the optics and telecommunications product lines 
segment earnings for fiscal decreased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
this reduction reflected decreased gross margins  lower sales volume and reduced product yields as a result of certain production related issues in our yag growth and development area 
military infrared optics bookings for fiscal for military infrared optics were million compared to million for eleven months ended june  during which period this segment of our business was owned by the company 
military bookings in the infrared crystals and optical components area were softer as compared to fiscal year  but were offset by stronger bookings of military contracts including the javelin antitank weapon system  the ifts and air borne laser programs 
revenues for fiscal for military infrared optics were million compared to million for the eleven months ended june  even on an annualized basis  the exotic electro optics business was the only business resulting in an increase to sales for the year 
segment earnings decreased to million from million compared to last fiscal year 
the reduction in segment earnings primarily related to major military contracts where technical challenges caused cost overruns eroding gross margins 
gross margins on military business  even absent of these cost overruns have historically lower margins as compared to our non military businesses 
other combined bookings for fiscal for ev products division and wbg group decreased to million as compared to million last fiscal year 
the decrease was due to the lower order intake by the company s ev products division 
revenues for fiscal from these operations decreased to million compared to million last fiscal year 
the lower revenues are the result of the absence in replacement revenues for ev products division s high volume fiscal year order relating to the nasa swift telescope program 
the segment loss for fiscal of million increased from the segment loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the segment loss was attributable to weakness in demand for products from the ev products division resulting in lower sales volume and significant increase in internal research and development expense by the wbg group 
the fiscal purchase of the litton systems  inc silicon carbide sic group  while accelerating our efforts in single crystal sic growth  at the same time increased our internal research and development expense 
costs and expenses manufacturing gross margin was million or of net revenues in fiscal compared to million or of net revenues in fiscal the dollar and percentage decrease was attributable to lower sales volume 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was also driven by a shift in the product mix during the past few quarters 
as the industrial business has slowed  the company has taken on more military business which historically has lower margins 
contract research and development gross margin was million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal compared to million or of contract research and development revenues in fiscal the gross margin was negatively impacted during the year as laser power corporation and  more specifically  the large optics coating facility  encountered continued production issues related to several developmental contracts 
company funded internal research and development remained relatively unchanged at million in fiscal from million in fiscal in general  internal research and development expense reflects increased efforts focused on silicon carbide crystal growth technology and processing development  the company s corporate research and development activities and the research and development activities of ev products division 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal this dollar and percentage decrease is attributable to the elimination of certain redundant expenses  as well as  expense and manpower reductions due to decreased manufacturing demand during fiscal interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the lower borrowings and continuing decrease of the company s libor based interest rate as compared to fiscal the company s weighted average interest rate was approximately lower at june  as compared to the previous year 
scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan component of the company s credit agreement began in fiscal other expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the other expense decrease was primarily due to the absence of approximately million of goodwill amortization incurred in fiscal see note e to the company s consolidated financial statements and foreign currency gains in as compared to losses in fiscal the overall decrease was partially offset by fiscal charges related to the closing of operations of laser power corporation in mexico of million  costs related to consolidating several of the company s european distribution arrangements of million  and the write off of certain crystal growth equipment and technology of million 
the effective corporate income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects the favorable mix of worldwide earnings from the company s focus on increased manufacturing in china and singapore where tax rates are lower than the united states 
liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  cash generated from operations was million 
proceeds from exercise of common stock options and fixed assets of million each  in addition to the cash generated from operations  were used primarily to fund an investment of million in property  plant and equipment  to finance a million acquisition for a majority ownership of ii vi lot and to pay down million of debt 
cash transactions for fiscal plus cash on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year resulted in a cash position of million at june  the largest sources of the million in cash generated from operations in fiscal were million in net earnings before depreciation and amortization  an increase in deferred income taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in other operating net assets of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million 
the impact of inflation on the company s business has not been material 
the company had available million and million under its line of credit as of june  and  respectively 
the company believes cash flow from operations  existing cash reserves and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs  capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments and internal growth 
during fiscal  the company reinvested million into capital projects

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years s long term debt obligations     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total     risk factors we depend on highly complex manufacturing processes which require products from limited sources of supply we utilize high quality  optical grade znse in the production of a majority of our products 
we are a leading producer of znse for our internal use and for external sale 
the production of znse is a complex process requiring production in a highly controlled environment 
a number of factors  including defective or contaminated materials  could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality znse 
znse is available from only one outside source where quantity and qualities may be limited 
the unavailability of necessary amounts of high quality znse would have a material adverse effect upon us 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of znse 
there are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material 
our inability to effectively handle hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide 
hydrogen selenide can be obtained from one outside source 
the cost of purchasing such material is significantly greater than the cost of internal production 
as a result  purchasing a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would significantly increase our production costs of znse 
therefore  our inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  we utilize other high purity  relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products 
failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is dependent on other cyclical industries our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end users of industrial lasers 
many of these end users are in industries that historically have experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products 
therefore  as a result  demand for our products and our results of operations are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
our revenues are subject to potential seasonal fluctuations due to our customers buying patterns  particularly in europe  revenues for our first fiscal quarter ending in september could be below those in the preceding quarter 
our first fiscal quarter results often are dependent upon the sales made in the last month of the quarter 
we may encounter substantial competition we may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market  including established companies with substantial resources 
some of our competitors may have financial  technical  marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors  and competition may adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
international sales account for a significant portion of our revenues sales to customers in countries other than the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the years ended june   and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we manufacture products in singapore and china and maintain direct sales offices in germany  japan  the uk and belgium 
sales and operations outside of the united states are subject to certain inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in particular  although our international sales  other than in germany  japan  belgium and the uk  are denominated in us dollars  currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  by rendering us less price competitive than foreign manufacturers 
our sales in japan are denominated in yen and  accordingly  are affected by fluctuations in the dollar yen currency exchange rates 
we generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations through forward exchange agreements hedging approximately of our sales in japan 
we do not engage in the speculative trading of financial derivatives 
there can be no assurance  however  that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation in the dollar yen currency exchange rate 
our revenues may suffer if general economic conditions worsen our revenues and earnings may be affected by general economic factors  such as excessive inflation  currency fluctuations and employment levels  resulting in a temporary or longer term overall decline in demand for our products 
therefore  any significant downturn or recession in the united states or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may expand product lines and markets by acquiring other businesses our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions 
any acquisition may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired  any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  acquired businesses may be experiencing operating losses 
any acquisition will involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
in fiscal  we acquired the virgo optics division of sandoz chemicals corporation 
in fiscal  we acquired lightening optical corporation 
subsequently  these acquisitions were combined to form our vloc subsidiary 
in fiscal  we acquired laser power corporation 
in fiscal  we acquired the litton system  inc silicon carbide group 
our success depends on new products and processes in order to meet our strategic objectives  we must continue to develop  manufacture and market new products  develop new processes and improve existing processes 
as a result  we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses  products  or technologies complementary to our business 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing  and product performance in the field 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse affect on our ability to grow our business 
failure to keep pace with industry developments may adversely affect our operations we are engaged in industries which will be affected by future developments 
the introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable 
our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost effective basis new products  processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  applications and processes and product or process enhancements  that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products  applications or processes  or that our products  applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products  applications or processes or product or process enhancements or if we did not gain market acceptance 
exposure to government markets with the acquisition of laser power corporation  specifically the military infrared optics business of exotic electro optics  sales to customers in the defense industry have increased 
these customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity  typically the us government 
most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body 
the loss or failure to obtain certain contracts or a loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on the ability to retain key personnel we are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists  engineers  production and management personnel 
competition for the services of these personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property we do not currently hold any material patents applicable to our processes and rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws and employee non competition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that  in the future  third parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
asserting our rights or defending against third party claims could involve substantial expense  thus materially and adversely affecting our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in the event a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights  we may have to pay substantial damages or royalties  or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify the process so that it no longer infringes such proprietary rights  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
a large portion of our european sales rely on a single distributor a large portion of our european sales not made by our subsidiaries in germany  the uk and belgium have been made through a european distributor 
this distributor also provides service and support to the end users of our products 
thus  a reduction in the sales efforts of this distributor could adversely affect our european sales and our ability to support the end users of our products 
there can be no assurance that this distributor will continue to distribute  or to distribute successfully  our products and  in such an event  our business  results of operations and financial earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
we recently established controlling interest in a new joint venture with the distributor serving the german market
