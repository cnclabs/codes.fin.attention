item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected the matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these same factors could affect our future financial performance in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include the decline in demand for our merchandise  productivity and profitability  marketing strategies  liquidity  vendor and their factor relations  flow of merchandise  compliance with our credit agreements  the availability of desirable store locations on suitable terms  changes in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  changes in weather patterns  changes in existing or potential duties  tariffs or quotas  paper and printing costs  the ability to hire and train associates and development of management information systems 
our operations have been historically seasonal  with a disproportionate amount of sales and a majority of net income occurring in the back to school and christmas selling seasons for value city and filene s basement 
dsw seasonal sales occurs both in early spring and fall 
as a result of seasonality  any factors negatively affecting us during these periods  including adverse weather  the timing and level of markdowns or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization  recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  the calculation of retirement benefits  estimates for self insurance reserves for health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance  income taxes  contingencies  litigation and revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial and appraisal techniques 
we constantly re evaluate these significant factors and make adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
while we believe that our historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate 
as the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgement  actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following represent the most critical estimates and assumptions  among others  used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the selection  application and disclosure of the critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
revenues from our retail operations are recognized at the latter of point of sale or the delivery of goods to the customer 
retail revenues are reduced by a provision for anticipated returns based on our historical trends by our customers 
cost of sales and merchandise inventories 
we use the retail method of accounting for substantially all of our merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out basis  or market using the retail inventory method 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on our consolidated balance sheet is decreased by charges to cost of sales at the time the retail value of the inventory is lowered through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as merchandise is marked down prior to sale 
reserves to value inventory at the lower of cost or market were million and million at the end of fiscal and  respectively 
inherent in the calculation of inventories are certain significant management judgements and estimates including  setting the original merchandise retail value or markon  markups of initial prices established  reduction of pricing due to customer s value perception or perceived value known as markdowns and estimates of losses between physical inventory counts or shrinkage  which combined with the averaging process within the retail method  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margins 
long lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of the related long lived asset and reduce the carrying value by the excess where the recorded value exceeds the fair value 
during fiscal  we recorded two different charges related to long lived assets 
the first charge was for goodwill impairment as a result of the implementation of sfas which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but would be subject to annual fair value based impairment tests 
the initial tests for goodwill impairment  as of february   resulted in a non cash charge of million  million net of taxes  which is reported in our consolidated statement of operations as of february  in the caption cumulative effect of accounting change 
substantially all of the charge relates to goodwill associated with our purchase of mazel s interest in vcm and is included in the net loss for the year ended february  at the end of the current fiscal year we have on our books million of goodwill subject to annual testing 
the second charge of million related to long lived assets at store operating units 
the result of reviewing undiscounted cash flows for stores under sfas  identified stores where the recorded value of the asset exceeded the fair value 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write down of capitalized development and software costs related to discontinued information systems and a goodwill write down of million relating to a previous acquisition 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates 
self insurance reserves 
we record estimates for certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance costs that are self insured programs 
these estimates are based on actuarial assumptions and are subject to change based on actual results 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated for costs of certain health and welfare  workers compensation and casualty insurance increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required 
pension 
the obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimarted future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the yield on fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at february   the weighted average actuarial assumption of our plans were discount rate  assumed salary increases and long term rate of return on plan assets 
to the extent actual results vary from assumptions  earnings would be impacted 
customer loyalty program 
we maintain a customer loyalty program for our dsw operations in which customers receive a future discount on qualifying purchases 
upon reaching the target level  customers may redeem these discounts on a future purchase 
generally  these future discounts must be redeemed in one year 
we accrue the estimated costs of the anticipated redemptions of the discount earned at the time of the initial purchase and charge such costs to selling  general and administrative expense based on historical experience 
the estimates of the costs associated with the loyalty program require us to make assumptions related to customer purchase levels and redemption rates 
accrued liability as of february  and february  were million and million  respectively 
to the extent assumptions of purchases and redemption rates vary from actual results  earnings would be impacted 
income taxes 
we do business in numerous jurisdictions that impose taxes 
management is required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount which will be currently payable based upon tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
the estimation process involves adjusting income determined by the application of generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different management judgements had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could be different 
see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f of this annual report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
results of operations we operate three business segments 
value city and filene s basement segments operate full line  off price department stores

new store openings in the period were limited to our dsw and filene s basement segments 
preparations for opening a dsw store or a filene s basement store generally take eight to ten weeks

we also implemented a new accounting principle during fiscal resulting in the impairment of goodwill 
the charge for the application of the new principle was million net of tax  or of sales 
we retained a valuation professional to assist in the calculation of impairment 
our initial test was performed as of the beginning of the fiscal year while our annual test occurred in the middle of the fourth quarter

the shoe business experiences increased sales in both early spring and fall seasons in relationship to the change in footwear desired by the dsw customer 
fiscal year we follow a week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest to january fiscal and contain weeks and fiscal has weeks

adoption of accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb periodically issues statements of financial accounting standards sfas  some of which require implementation by a date falling within or after the close of the fiscal year 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under this statement  obligations that meet the definition of a liability will be recognized consistently with the retirement of the associated tangible long lived assets 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
at this time  we have yet to determine the effect of this pronouncement on its results of operations and financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the standard rescinds fasb statements no 
and that deal with issues relating to the extinguishment of debt 
the standard also rescinds fasb statement no 
that deals with intangible assets of motor carriers 
the standard modifies sfas no 
 accounting for leases  so that certain capital lease modifications must be accounted for by lessees as sale leaseback transactions 
additionally  the standard identifies amendments that should have been made to previously existing pronouncements and formally amends the appropriate pronouncements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant effect on our results of operations or our financial position 
for fiscal year  we will be required to reclassify the loss on the extinguishment of debt from extraordinary to interest expense  in the condensed consolidated statements of operations  under the provisions of sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for the current fiscal year 
however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
we have no guarantees as of february  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no

fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company  if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we have no variable interest entities as of february  inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation because of the nature of the estimates required  management believes that the effect of inflation  if any  on the results of operations and financial condition has been minor

proceeds from lease incentives are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the lease 
on june   we  together with our principal subsidiaries  entered into a million refinancing that consists of three separate credit facilities i a new three year million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  ii two million term loan facilities provided equally by cerberus partners  lp and schottenstein stores corporation the term loans  and iii an amended and restated million senior convertible loan  initially entered into by us on march   which is held equally by cerberus partners  lp and ssc the convertible loan 
million revolving credit facility under the revolving credit facility  the borrowing base formula is structured in a manner that allows us and our subsidiaries availability based on the value of inventories and receivables 
primary security for the revolving credit facility is provided by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts receivable  as well as certain intercompany notes and payment intangibles 
the revolving credit facility also has a second priority perfected interest in all of the collateral securing the term loans 
interest on borrowings is calculated at the bank s base rate or eurodollar rate plus to  depending upon the level of average excess availability we maintain 
million term loans the term loans are comprised of a million term loan b and a million term loan c 
all obligations under the term loans are senior debt  ranking pari passu with the revolving credit facility and the convertible loan 
we and our principal subsidiaries are obligated on the term loans 
the term loans stated rate of interest per annum during the initial two years of the agreement is if paid in cash and if we elect a paid in kind pik option 
during the first two years of the term loans  we may pay all interest by pik 
during the final year of the term loans  the stated rate of interest is if paid in cash or by pik and the pik option is limited to of the interest due 
we issued on september    warrants warrants to purchase shares of common stock  at an initial exercise price of per share  to the term loan c lenders 
the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants and the per share exercise price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
the warrants are exercisable at any time prior to june  we have granted the term loan c lenders registration rights with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
the value placed on the warrants was million and the related debt discount is amortized into interest expense over the life of the debt 
million senior convertible loan we have amended and restated our million convertible loan dated march  as amended  borrowings under the convertible loan will bear interest at per annum 
at our option  interest may be pik during the first two years  and thereafter  at our option  up to of the interest due may be pik until maturity 
the convertible loan is guaranteed by all principal subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on assets junior to liens granted in favor of the revolving credit facility and term loans 
the convertible loan is not prepayable until june  the agent has the right to designate two observers to our board of directors for so long as the agent is the beneficial owner of at least of the advances initially made by it and has the right to designate two individuals to our board of directors for so long as the agent is the beneficial owner of at least of the conversion shares issued upon conversion of the advances initially made by it 
the convertible loan is convertible at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
achievement of expected cash flows from operations and compliance with the covenants of our credit agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon a number of factors  including the attainment of sales  gross profit  expense levels  vendor relations  and flow of merchandise that are consistent with our financial projections 
future limitations of credit availability by factor organizations and or vendors will restrict our ability to obtain merchandise and services and may impair operating results 
although operating results for fiscal were below plan  we believe that cash generated by operations  along with the available proceeds from our credit agreements and other sources of financing will be sufficient to meet our obligations for working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to meet our projections 
further  there is no assurance that extended financing will be available in the future if we fail to meet our projections or on terms acceptable to us 
acquisitions effective with the close of business on february  by acquisition of our partner s interest in vcm for million  we now own of vcm and operate the health and beauty care  toy  sporting goods and food departments in our value city stores

the assumed liabilities included the payment of amounts outstanding under filene s basement debtor in possession financing facility of approximately million and certain trade payable and other obligations which were paid in the ordinary course of business 
allocation of the purchase price has been determined based on fair market valuation of the net assets acquired 
the acquisition was funded by cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds from the credit agreement 
in april  we paid the remaining balance of the purchase obligation of approximately million 
these acquisitions were funded by cash from operations and a portion of the proceeds from the credit agreement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at february   direct borrowings aggregated million 
the revolving credit facility permits debt commitments up to million  matures on june  and generally bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus to based on the average excess availability during the previous quarter 
we utilize interest rate swap agreements to effectively establish long term fixed rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility  thus reducing a portion of our interest rate risk 
these swap agreements  which are designated as cash flow hedges  involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements 
at february   we had outstanding swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million  for which the interest rate has been locked at a fixed rate of until april
