item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipated  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth elsewhere in this report 
please see risk factors  below  and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts and impairment of intangible assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and bad debt we generate revenues primarily from sales of multimedia and interactive digital training systems and use of force simulators specifically targeted for law enforcement and firearms training and from service contracts related to such sales  from providing lightweight armoring services of vehicles  and  to a lesser extent  from sale of zinc air battery products for defense applications and from development services and long term arrangements subcontracted by the u 
s government 
we recognize revenues in respect of products when  among other things  we have delivered the goods being purchased and we believe collectibility to be reasonably assured 
we do not grant a right of return to our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and we require collateral as deemed necessary 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those accounts that we have determined to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  and this might cause a revision of recognized revenues 
revenues from development services are recognized using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method  based on completion of agreed upon milestones and in accordance with the output method or based on the time and material basis 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses is determined 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory write offs and write down provisions are provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items or technological obsolescence 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are primarily based upon forecasted demand for our products  and any change to the reserves arising from forecast revisions would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
as required by applicable accounting rules  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances  and we write down goodwill when impaired  rather than amortizing it as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for the reportable units 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
as a result of mdt and ies acquisitions  we recorded goodwill in the amount of  as of december  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
as of december   no impairment losses have been identified 
the determination of the value of such long lived and intangible assets requires management to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record impairment charges 
any material change in our valuation of assets in the future and any consequent adjustment for impairment could have a material adverse impact on our future reported financial results 
as a result of mdt and ies acquisitions  we recorded intangible assets in the amount of million as of december  business combinations we have accounted for the combination with ies and mdt utilizing the purchase method of accounting 
the combination required management to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these estimates have been based on our business plans for the entity acquired 
should the actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values would be required 
if a change in estimate occurs after one year following the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas no 
requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
recent developments german police order in january  ies was awarded a million contract to supply simulation training systems to the largest regional police division in germany 
the contract calls for delivery of several separate interactive training systems  with delivery dates ranging from april to september and payment dates due following delivery  testing and ascertainment of appropriate run capability of each system 
general during  we acquired two new subsidiaries  ies and mdt  we closed our money losing consumer battery operations  and we reorganized into two divisions defense and security products and electric fuel batteries 
we have previously been organized into instant power  electric vehicles  and defense and security products 
additionally  we focused on increasing our activities in the defense and security sectors  following the expansion of our battery development and procurement contracts with the us army s communications electronics command cecom and other defense related agencies  while searching for new opportunities to market our core zinc air technology for commercial applications and to oems 
with an expanded focus on defense and homeland security technology and business opportunities  we launched new zinc air battery products designed to meet the requirements of this market 
we also concentrated intensive efforts on various cost cutting strategies  including downsizing staff in areas showing lower productivity and mandating participation among salaried employees in our options for salary plan  whereby employees permanently waived a portion of their salaries generally between and in exchange for options to purchase shares of our common stock at a ratio of options to purchase shares of our stock for each dollar in salary waived 
these options are issued at a market value exercise price  so that they are not recorded as an expense on our financials 
this program ended at the end of in conjunction with these cost cutting efforts and with the movement of our activities away from consumer sales and in the direction of defense and security products and services  we decided during the third quarter of to discontinue retail sales of our consumer battery products  effective in october as a result of this decision  more than employees were terminated 
the discontinuation of the consumer retail products resulted in a one time  pre tax charge of approximately million during  reflecting a write down of inventory and net fixed assets as well as costs associated with the reduction in our workforce 
almost all these charges were non cash impacting items 
our line of existing battery products for the military and defense sectors includes v  ah advanced zinc air power packs azapps utilizing our most advanced cells which have specific energy of wh kg  a line of super lightweight azapps that feature the same wh kg cell technology in new ah cells  and our new  high power v zinc air power packs zapps  which offer extended use v portable power and current ratings up to a  using our commercial zinc air cell technology 
our electric fuel batteries division is continuing with the production of zinc air fuel cell packs for the us army s communications electronics command cecom 
the volt  watt hour battery pack for battlefield power  which is based on our zinc air fuel cell technology  is approximately the size and weight of a notebook computer 
the battery is based on a new generation of lightweight  ampere hours cells developed by us for both military and future commercial products with high energy requirements 
in december  we entered into a contract with the us army communications electronic command cecom pursuant to usc ss 
c  unusual and compelling urgency  for a delivery order of advanced zinc air batteries 
the contract calls for order releases during the first three calendar quarters of  with a current order ceiling of  under the terms of the contract  we will produce and supply the ba u zinc air nonrechargeable battery 
ba u is the new army designation for electric fuel s model fc advanced zinc air power pack  as it was previously known during its development phase 
in addition  we will supply three types of electrical interface adapters for the ba u  including equipment specific adapters for the an prc sincgars and sincgars asip tactical radio sets  and a generic interface for items of equipment that were designed to interface with a ba or equivalent battery 
each of the three interfaces was also assigned a national stock number nsn by cecom 
the ba u was assigned an nsn in august the ba u is a volt  watt hour battery pack approximately the size and weight of a notebook computer 
the battery is based on a new generation of lightweight  ampere hours cells that we developed over the last five years with partial funding by cecom 
in extensive field testing  the ba u battery typically provided to times the run time of a ba  a primary lithium battery pack widely used in the military 
additionally  the electric fuel batteries division is continuing with the introduction of the new emergency lights for the marine life jackets market 
in july  our existing research and development contract with cecom was modified to provide us with additional funding of ten thousand dollars in order to develop prototype zinc air batteries for battlefield drones 
as a result  we developed and plan to produce advanced zinc air batteries for unmanned air vehicles uavs and micro air vehicles mavs 
the new batteries will provide the military s man portable battlefield drones with longer range and flying time than existing battery alternatives 
our solutions for uavs and mavs are high power  lightweight versions of our most advanced zinc air cells  which have specific energy of wh kg 
our electric fuel batteries division is also continuing its american all electric transit bus demonstration project  subcontracted by the federal transit administration fta 
we successfully completed phase i in june and phase ii of the fta program in july  and have recently received approval of subcontracting fees from the fta to begin phase iii of the program  which will focus on an evaluation of the performance of zinc air battery propulsion systems for transit buses  the installation of new advanced ultra capacitors  and the implementation of an advanced control system for auxiliaries 
during  we continued to invest in strengthening our intellectual property position 
we have unexpired us patents and corresponding european patents issued covering general aspects and various applications of our zinc air technology  these patents expire between and we have experienced significant fluctuations in the sources and amounts of our revenues and expenses  and we believe that the following comparisons of results of operations for the periods presented do not necessarily provide a meaningful indication of our development 
our research and development expenses have been offset  to a limited extent  by the periodic receipt of research grants from israel s office of the chief scientist 
we expect that  because of these and other factors  including our acquisitions of ies and mdt  our discontinuation of certain of our operations  and general economic conditions and delays due to legislation and regulatory and other processes and the development of competing technologies  future results of operations may not necessarily be meaningfully compared with those of current and prior periods 
thus  we believe that period to period comparisons of its past results of operations should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of defense and security products that we manufacture directly and through our subsidiaries and from components of the electric fuel electric vehicle system  there can be no assurance that we will ever derive such revenues or achieve profitability 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary electric fuel efl ltd 
efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of mdt is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts has been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
results of operations preliminary note results for the year ended december  include the results of ies and mdt for such period as a result of our acquisitions of these companies early in the third quarter of the results of ies and mdt were not included in our operating results for the year ended december  accordingly  the following year to year comparisons should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance 
in addition  results are net of the operations of the retail consumer battery products  which operations were discontinued in the third quarter of fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results in during  we recognized revenues from the sale of interactive use of force training systems through our ies subsidiary  from payments under vehicle armoring contracts through our mdt subsidiary  and from the sale of lifejacket lights  as well as under contracts with the us army s cecom for deliveries of batteries and for design and procurement of production tooling and equipment 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with phase ii of the united states department of transportation dot program  which began in the fourth quarter of and was completed in july  and phase iii of the dot program  which began in october we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii was million  of which was covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
in  we derived revenues principally from the sale of lifejacket lights  under contracts with the us army s cecom for deliveries of batteries and for design and procurement of production tooling and equipment and from subcontracting fees received in connection with the dot program 
in  revenues were million for the defense and security products division compared to in  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results  and million for the electric fuel batteries division compared to million in the comparable period in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to revenues from a german consortium project relating to our electric vehicle that were included in but that did not exist in cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results 
direct expenses for our two divisions during were million for the defense and security products division compared to in  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results  and million for the electric fuel batteries division compared to million in the comparable period in  an increase of  or  due primarily to the following factors o we began to ramp up production at our cecom facility in alabama in anticipation of the cecom order that we received in december  and o we wrote off certain disqualified cecom inventory in the amount of gross profit was million during  compared to  during  an increase of million 
this increase was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of ies in our results 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  compared to  in  an increase of million  or  primarily attributable to the increase in marketing consultants and other expenses  such as travel  for our electric fuel battery division as well as due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results beginning with the third quarter  which increased general and administrative expenses by approximately  this increase was offset by decrease in general and expenses of  resulting from o the dismissal of our litigation with electrofuel inc  which resulted in a decrease in litigation related legal expenses  and o the settlement of our dispute with a former employee on terms that resulted in a savings to us over the amount that we had set aside on our books 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expenses and exchange differentials  totaled approximately  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was due primarily to lower interest rates and lower balances of invested funds as a result of our use of the proceeds of private placements of our securities 
income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
mdt had taxable income  but we may use efl s losses to offset mdt s income  and accordingly mdt has made no provision for income taxes 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets totaled  in  compared to in  due to the inclusion of ies and mdt in our results 
net loss from continuing operations 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss from continuing operations of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of  or 
net loss from discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products 
accordingly  all revenues and expenses related to this segment have been presented in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in an item entitled loss from discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations in was million  compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was the result of a write off of fixed inventory and assets in the amount of million in connection with our discontinuation of the operations relating to the retail sales of our consumer battery products at the end of the third quarter of which was not entirely offset by the elimination of the losses from these discontinued operations beginning with the fourth quarter of net loss 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year preliminary note 
we have broken down the results for the years ended december  and in accordance with the continuing operations divisions that we maintained at the time electric vehicle  and defense and security products which at the time consisted of only our cecom batteries and our water activated batteries 
beginning in  both of these divisions were combined into a single division called electric fuel batteries 
it is therefore appropriate to compare our overall results from continuing operations in and with the results of our electric fuel battery division in revenues 
revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  an increase of  or 
during  we recognized revenues from continuing operations from the sale of lifejacket lights and portable high power zinc air fuel cell packs for military use 
we also recognized revenues from subcontracting fees received in connection with the united states department of transportation dot program which began in and  after we completed phase i in july of  was extended in the fourth quarter of we participate in this program as a member of a consortium seeking to demonstrate the ability of the electric fuel battery system to power a full size  all electric transit bus 
the total program cost of phase ii is approximately million  of which will be covered by the dot subcontracting fees 
subcontracting fees cover less than all of the expenses and expenditures associated with our participation in the program 
we also received electric vehicle revenues during from our german consortium efrb project 
in  we derived revenues from continuing operations principally from the sale of lifejacket lights 
additionally  we also recognized revenues from activities related to the dot program 
in  revenues were  for the electric vehicle division compared to  in  an increase of  or and million for the defense and security products division formerly known as the defense and safety products division compared to million in  unchanged 
the increase in revenues from the electric vehicle division in was the result of our having received the german consortium efrb project  described above 
this project generated revenues of  in cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily the result of the increase in our electric vehicle revenues in  as described above  which also resulted in an increase in cost of goods sold 
gross profit was  during  compared to  during  an increase of  this increase was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the increased electric vehicle revenues during from our german consortium efrb project 
research and development expenses  net 
research and development expenses less royalty bearing grants for were  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses were reduced by of royalty bearing grants from the bird foundation during compared to  in 
direct expenses for our two divisions for the fiscal year ended december  were  for the electric vehicle division  in  an increase of  or  and million for the defense and security products division million in  an increase of  or 
the increase of expenses in the electric vehicle division was the result of progress that was made in phase ii of the fta program and the german program 
net costs of fixed assets net of accumulated depreciation at december  in the electric vehicle and defense and security products divisions were  and  respectively 
selling expenses 
selling expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  in  a decrease of  or 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in  an increase of  or 
this increase in expenses was the result of the following factors in descending order of importance o increases in management salaries and in accruals related to our senior employees  accounting for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses  o non cash write down of notes receivable from certain stockholders reflecting a diminution in the market value of securities collateralizing such notes  accounting for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses  and o an increase in expenses related to travel  consultants  and directors and officers liability insurance  accounting for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
financial income 
financial income  net of interest expenses and exchange differentials  totaled approximately  in compared to  in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to lower interest rates and lower balances of invested funds as a result of our use of the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in may and november  which was only partially offset by income from the proceeds of private placements of our securities conducted in may  november and december  as well as a decrease in interest income from certain shareholder loans 
income taxes 
we and our israeli subsidiary efl incurred net operating losses during and and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
net loss from continuing operations 
due to the factors cited above  particularly the increase in general and administrative expenses and the decrease in financial income  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of  or 
net loss from discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primary the result of the following factors in descending order of importance o our sales and marketing expenses increased in compared to  primarily because of increased sales and marketing expenses in the united states and the united kingdom  accounting for an increase in sales and marketing of approximately million  o our revenues derived from discontinued operations were lower by an amount of  primarily because a single large order that we received from one customer wal mart during was not repeated in  thereby resulting in fewer products sold 
an additional factor in the decrease in revenues was our reduction in the price at which we sold our products during  which resulted in lower revenues from the products we did sell  o products that we had sold that were still subject to possible return continued to be carried as inventory 
once it was clear that these products would not be returned  we decreased the inventory  resulting in an increase in cost of revenues of approximately  o we took an inventory write off as a result of a decision to discontinue production and sale of most disposable battery products in response to low consumer demand for those products  accounting for an increase in cost of revenues of approximately  o when we lowered the retail prices of our products  we recognized losses on those of our products that we carried in inventory due to the principle of presenting inventory at the lower of cost or market value  accounting for an increase in cost of revenues of approximately o we increased our accruals for doubtful debts because a greater portion of our accounts receivable was aged over six months  accounting for approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses  o we concentrated on production of chargers  which were more popular than disposable batteries but which have higher production costs and hence a higher gross loss than do the disposable batteries that we emphasized in  accounting for an increase in cost of revenues of approximately  and o some of our equipment began to be depreciable beginning in the second half of  which resulted in an increase in our cost of revenues during of the amount of the depreciation  which was approximately the above factors were offset to some extent by reduction in research and development expenses related to our discontinued operation in compared to  primarily as a result of our move from a company primarily engaged in research and development to a company engaged in production 
net loss 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in without taking into account a deemed dividend to certain shareholders as a result of the repricing of warrants held by certain of our investors  as described in note g of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  compared to a net loss of million in  and increase of million  or 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  and certificates of deposit due within one year amounting to  compared with million as of december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in cash was primarily the result of losses incurred in our consumer battery division  which we shut down in the third quarter of  and the costs of the acquisitions of ies and mdt 
we used available funds in primarily for the acquisition of ies and mdt  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by  including fixed assets used in discontinued operations during the year ended december   primarily in the electric fuel batteries division 
our fixed assets amounted to million as at year end after the write off of net fixed assets in the amount of million due to discontinuation of our consumer battery business 
net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of an increased net loss  an increase in inventory and a decrease in accounts payable and in accruals in comparison to net cash used in investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily the result of our investment in the acquisition of ies and mdt 
net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower amounts of funds raised through sales of our common stock in compared to our israeli subsidiary efl presently has a line of credit with the first international bank of israel ltd 
fibi of up to  secured by such security as we and the bank shall agree upon from time to time 
this credit facility imposes financial and other covenants on arotech and efl 
as of december   the bank had issued letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling approximately  during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options were approximately  on january  we issued and sold to grenville finance ltd  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
on january  we issued and sold to various institutional investors affiliated with the special situation funds  for an aggregate purchase price of  an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
on december  we issued and sold to various institutional investors we issued and sold to three institutional investors an aggregate  principal amount of secured convertible debentures due june   as more fully described under item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters recent sales of unregistered securities  above 
we have approximately million in long term debt outstanding  and approximately million in short term debt 
approximately of the stock of our israeli based subsidiary efl is deemed to be beneficially owned directly  indirectly or by application of certain attribution rules by four united states citizens leon s 
gross  austin w 
marxe and david m 
greenhouse  and robert s 
ehrlich 
information with respect to the stockholdings of messrs 
marxe and greenhouse is based on a schedule g filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   as amended on february  if at any time in the future  more than of either i the voting power of our stock  or ii the total value of our stock  is held or deemed to be held by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of our stock who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company stock ownership test under the internal revenue code and we could be subject to additional us taxes on any undistributed foreign personal holding company income of efl 
for  efl had no income which would qualify as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
however  no assurance can be given that in the future efl will not have income that qualifies as undistributed foreign personal holding company income 
we believe that our present cash position and anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our estimated cash requirements through the next year 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations historically  the majority of our revenues have been in us dollars 
the united states dollar cost of our operations in israel  with regard to expenses incurred in nis  is influenced by the extent to which an increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset by the devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the past two years  inflation in israel has been more than fully compensated by the devaluation of the nis and  accordingly  the dollar cost of our nis expenses has decreased 
even if the recent trend is reversed as was the case in previous years  we do not believe that continuing inflation in israel or delays in the devaluation of the nis are likely to have a material adverse effect on us  except to the extent that such circumstances have an impact on israel s economy as a whole 
in the years ended december   and  the annual rates of inflation in israel were  and  respectively  compared to the devaluation of the nis against the dollar during such periods of  and  respectively 
additionally  our million contract to supply simulation training systems to the largest regional police division in germany is denominated in euros 
effective corporate tax rate our production facilities in israel have been granted approved enterprise status under the israel law for encouragement of capital investments   and consequently are eligible for certain tax benefits for seven to ten years after they first generate taxable income provided the maximum period as prescribed by law has not elapsed 
under this law  a company may either accept government grants and receive a reduced tax rate  or forego government grants and receive an alternate package of tax benefits that includes a complete exemption from certain taxes 
we have elected to receive a grant of funds together with a reduced tax rate for the aforementioned period 
efl s effective corporate tax rate may be affected by the classification of certain items of income as being approved income for purposes of the approved enterprise law  and hence subject to a lower tax rate to  depending on the extent of foreign ownership of efl presently than is imposed on other forms of income under israeli law presently 
the effective tax upon income we distribute to our stockholders would be increased as a result of the withholding tax imposed upon dividends distributed by efl to arotech  resulting in an overall effective corporate tax rate of approximately for income arising from efl s approved enterprises and regarding other income 
arotech and efl have incurred net operating losses or had earnings arising from tax exempt income during the years ended december   and and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
taxes in these entities paid in  and are primarily composed of united states federal alternative minimum taxes 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million that are available to offset future taxable income  expiring primarily in  and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
business related risks we have had a history of losses and may incur future losses 
we were incorporated in and began our operations in we have funded our operations principally from funds raised in each of the initial public offering of our common stock in february  through subsequent public and private offerings of our common stock and equity and debt securities convertible into shares of our common stock  research contracts and supply contracts  funds received under research and development grants from the government of israel  and sales of products that we and our subsidiaries manufacture 
we incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
additionally  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitability or that our business will continue to exist 
additionally  because we do not presently meet the transaction requirements for filing registration statements for primary offerings of our securities on the simpler form s registration statement  raising capital through sales of our securities may be more difficult in the future than it has been in the past 
our existing indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns 
our indebtedness  including the aggregate principal amount of the debentures sold by us in december  aggregated approximately million as of december  accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including o we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs and  as a result  we have less funds available for operations  future acquisitions of consumer receivable portfolios  and other purposes  o it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds through financings  if available at all  o we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general economic conditions  and o if we default under any of our existing debt instruments or if our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
the agreements governing the terms of our debentures contain numerous affirmative and negative covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and place restrictions on us  including obligations on our part to preserve and maintain our assets and restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee debt  to merge with or sell our assets to another company  and to make significant capital expenditures without the consent of the debenture holders 
our ability to comply with these and other provisions of such agreements may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
failure to comply with the terms of our debentures could result in a default that could have material adverse consequences for us 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in our debenture agreements  including a failure to have our registration statement registering the shares underlying our debentures and the warrants issued as part of the debenture financing declared effective by the sec on or before january   could result in an event of default under such agreements which could result in an acceleration of the debentures and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the indebtedness under the debentures or other indebtedness were to be accelerated  there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness 
the foregoing description of our agreement with our debenture holders is qualified in its entirety by reference to the agreements with our debenture holders filed as exhibits to our current report on form k that we filed with the sec on january we have pledged a substantial portion of our assets to secure our borrowings 
the debentures are secured by a substantial portion of our assets 
if we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets  those assets would be available to the secured creditor to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditor  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect our stock price 
we need significant amounts of capital to operate and grow our business 
we require substantial funds to conduct the necessary research  development and testing of our products  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  and to market our products 
we continue to seek additional funding  including through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain any such additional financing in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  stockholders may incur further dilution 
if additional funding is not secured  we will have to modify  reduce  defer or eliminate parts of our anticipated future commitments and or programs 
we may not be successful in operating a new business 
prior to the ies and mdt acquisitions  our primary business was the marketing and sale of products based on primary and refuelable zinc air fuel cell technology and advancements in battery technology for defense and security products and other military applications  electric vehicles and consumer electronics 
as a result of the ies and mdt acquisitions  a substantial component of our business will be the marketing and sale of hi tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for training military  law enforcement and security personnel and sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes used to armor vehicles 
these are new businesses for us and our management group has limited experience operating these types of businesses 
although we have retained the management personnel at ies and mdt  we cannot assure that such personnel will continue to work for us or that we will be successful in managing this new business 
if we are unable to successfully operate these new businesses  especially the business of ies  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially impaired 
we cannot assure you of market acceptance of our military zinc air battery products and electric vehicle technology 
our batteries for the defense industry and a signal light powered by water activated batteries for use in life jackets and other rescue apparatus are the only commercial zinc air battery products we currently have available for sale 
significant resources will be required to develop and produce additional consumer products utilizing this technology on a commercial scale 
additional development will be necessary in order to commercialize our technology and each of the components of the electric fuel system for electric vehicles and defense products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  engineer or commercialize our zinc air energy system  or that we will be able to develop products for commercial sale or that  if developed  they can be produced in commercial quantities or at acceptable costs or be successfully marketed 
the likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation and development of a relatively early stage business and with development activities generally 
we believe that public pressure and government initiatives are important factors in creating an electric vehicle market 
however  there can be no assurance that there will be sufficient public pressure or that further legislation or other governmental initiatives will be enacted  or that current legislation will not be repealed  amended  or have its implementation delayed 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that even if an electric fuel vehicle market develops  a different form of zero emission or low emission vehicle will dominate the market 
in addition  we cannot assure you that other solutions to the problem of containing emissions created by internal combustion engines will not be invented  developed and produced 
any other solution could achieve greater market acceptance than electric vehicles 
the failure of a significant market for electric vehicles to develop would have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize this aspect of our technology 
even if a significant market for electric vehicles develops  there can be no assurance that our technology will be commercially competitive within that market 
our acquisition strategy involves various risks 
part of our strategy is to grow through the acquisition of companies that will complement our existing operations or provide us with an entry into markets we do not currently serve 
growth through acquisitions involves substantial risks  including the risk of improper valuation of the acquired business and the risk of inadequate integration 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition candidates will be available  that we will be able to acquire or manage profitably such additional companies or that future acquisitions will produce returns that justify our investments therein 
in addition  we may compete for acquisition and expansion opportunities with companies that have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business  distract the attention of our senior managers  make it difficult to maintain our operational standards  controls and procedures and subject us to contingent and latent risks that are different  in nature and magnitude  than the risks we currently face 
we may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations or additional debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate internal cash or obtain financing from external sources or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of additional common stock to finance acquisitions may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
any debt financing may significantly increase our leverage and may involve restrictive covenants which limit our operations 
we may not successfully integrate our new acquisitions 
in light of our recent acquisitions of ies and mdt  our success will depend in part on our ability to manage the combined operations of these companies and to integrate the operations and personnel of these companies along with our other subsidiaries and divisions into a single organizational structure 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively integrate the operations of our subsidiaries and divisions and our newly acquired businesses into a single organizational structure 
integration of these operations could also place additional pressures on our management as well as on our key technical resources 
the failure to successfully manage this integration could have an adverse material effect on us 
if we are successful in acquiring additional businesses  we may experience a period of rapid growth that could place significant additional demands on  and require us to expand  our management  resources and management information systems 
our failure to manage any such rapid growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operating results will be impaired 
we are currently experiencing a period of growth and development activity which could place a significant strain on our personnel and resources 
our activity has resulted in increased levels of responsibility for both existing and new management personnel 
many of our management personnel have had limited or no experience in managing growing companies 
we have sought to manage our current and anticipated growth through the recruitment of additional management and technical personnel and the implementation of internal systems and controls 
however  our failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations 
we will need to develop the experience to manufacture certain of our products in commercial quantities and at competitive prices 
we currently have limited experience in manufacturing in commercial quantities and have  to date  produced only limited quantities of military batteries and components of the batteries for electric vehicles 
in order for us to be successful in the commercial market  these products must be manufactured to meet high quality standards in commercial quantities at competitive prices 
the development of the necessary manufacturing technology and processes will require extensive lead times and the commitment of significant amounts of financial and engineering resources  which may not be available to us 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop this technology or these processes 
moreover  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement the quality control measures necessary for commercial manufacturing 
some of the components of our technology and our products pose potential safety risks which could create potential liability exposure for us 
some of the components of our technology and our products contain elements that are known to pose potential safety risks 
also  because electric vehicle batteries contain large amounts of electrical energy  they may cause injuries if not handled properly 
in addition to these risks  and although we incorporate safety procedures in our research  development and manufacturing processes  there can be no assurance that accidents in our facilities will not occur 
any accident  whether occasioned by the use of all or any part of our products or technology or by our manufacturing operations  could adversely affect commercial acceptance of our products and could result in significant production delays or claims for damages resulting from injuries 
any of these occurrences would materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we may face product liability claims 
to date  there have been no material claims or threatened claims against us by users of our products  including the products manufactured by mdt  based on a failure of our products to perform as specified 
in the event that any claims for substantial amounts were to be asserted against us  they could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain general product liability insurance 
however  there is no assurance that the amount of our insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained at the present level of cost  or at all 
some of our business is dependent on government contracts 
most of ies s customers to date have been in the public sector of the us  including the federal  state and local governments  and in the public sectors of a number of other countries  and most of mdt s customers have been in the public sector in israel 
a significant decrease in the overall level or allocation of defense spending or law enforcement in the us or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
sales to public sector customers are subject to a multiplicity of detailed regulatory requirements and public policies as well as to changes in training and purchasing priorities 
contracts with public sector customers may be conditioned upon the continuing availability of public funds  which in turn depends upon lengthy and complex budgetary procedures  and may be subject to certain pricing constraints 
moreover  us government contracts and those of many international government customers may generally be terminated for a variety of factors when it is in the best interests of the government and contractors may be suspended or debarred for misconduct at the discretion of the government 
there can be no assurance that these factors or others unique to government contracts or the loss or suspension of necessary regulatory licenses will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
our fields of business are highly competitive 
the competition to develop defense and security products and electric vehicle battery systems  and to obtain funding for the development of these products  is  and is expected to remain  intense 
our defense and security products compete with other manufacturers of specialized training systems  including firearms training systems  inc  a producer of interactive simulation systems designed to provide training in the handling and use of small and supporting arms 
in addition  we compete with manufacturers and developers of armor for cars and vans  including o gara hess eisenhardt  a division of armor holdings  inc our battery technology competes with other battery technologies  as well as other zinc air technologies 
the competition in this area of our business consists of development stage companies  major international companies and consortia of such companies  including battery manufacturers  automobile manufacturers  energy production and transportation companies  consumer goods companies and defense contractors 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours 
various battery technologies are being considered for use in electric vehicles and defense and safety products by other manufacturers and developers  including the following lead acid  nickel cadmium  nickel iron  nickel zinc  nickel metal hydride  sodium sulfur  sodium nickel chloride  zinc bromine  lithium ion  lithium polymer  lithium iron sulfide  primary lithium  rechargeable alkaline and zinc air 
if we are unable to compete successfully in each of our operating areas  especially in the defense and security products area of our business  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
failure to receive required regulatory permits or to comply with various regulations to which we are subject could adversely affect our business 
regulations in europe  israel  the united states and other countries impose various controls and requirements relating to various components of our business 
while we believe that our current and contemplated operations conform to those regulations  we cannot assure you that we will not be found to be in non compliance 
we have applied for  and received  the necessary permits under the israel dangerous substances law   required for the use of potassium hydroxide and zinc metal 
however  there can be no assurance that changes in these regulations or the adoption of new regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us  subject us to future liabilities  or restrict our ability to operate our business 
our business is dependent on patents and other proprietary rights that may be difficult to protect and could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes through a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
we hold patents  or patent applications  covering elements of our technology in the united states and in europe 
in addition  we have patent applications pending in the united states and in foreign countries  including the european community  israel and japan 
we intend to continue to file patent applications covering important features of our technology 
we cannot assure you  however  that patents will issue from any of these pending applications or  if patents issue  that the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any of our patents will not be challenged or invalidated  that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor or that third parties will not make infringement claims against us 
litigation  or participation in administrative proceedings  may be necessary to protect our proprietary rights 
this type of litigation can be costly and time consuming and could divert company resources and management attention to defend our rights  and this could harm us even if we were to be successful in the litigation 
the invalidation of patents owned by or licensed to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws  rules and procedures that differ from those of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that foreign patent applications related to patents issued in the united states will be granted 
furthermore  even if these patent applications are granted  some foreign countries provide significantly less patent protection than the united states 
in the absence of patent protection  and despite our reliance upon our proprietary confidential information  our competitors may be able to use innovations similar to those used by us to design and manufacture products directly competitive with our products 
in addition  no assurance can be given that others will not obtain patents that we will need to license or design around 
to the extent any of our products are covered by third party patents  we could require a license under such patents to develop and market our patents 
despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  competition is intense  and there can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
moreover  in the event of patent litigation  we cannot assure you that a court would determine that we were the first creator of inventions covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for those inventions 
if existing or future third party patents containing broad claims were upheld by the courts or if we were found to infringe third party patents  we may not be able to obtain the required licenses from the holders of such patents on acceptable terms  if at all 
failure to obtain these licenses could cause delays in the introduction of our products or necessitate costly attempts to design around such patents  or could foreclose the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
we could also incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in patent infringement suits brought by others and in prosecuting patent infringement suits against infringers 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through non disclosure and confidentiality agreements with our customers  employees  consultants  strategic partners and potential strategic partners 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we have undergone recent management changes 
in october  yehuda harats  who had been our ceo since the inception of our company  resigned from his positions with us in order to pursue other interests 
our board of directors selected our long time chairman of the board  robert s 
ehrlich  to be our new president and ceo 
our success will depend to some extent on our ability to quickly and smoothly execute the change in leadership as a result of this change of ceo 
we are dependent on key personnel and our business would suffer if we fail to retain them 
we are highly dependent on certain members of our management and engineering staff  and the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could adversely affect us 
we are especially dependent on the services of our chairman  president and chief executive officer  robert s 
ehrlich 
the loss of mr 
ehrlich could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are party to an employment agreement with mr 
ehrlich  which agreement expires at the end of we do not have key man life insurance on mr 
ehrlich 
there are risks involved with the international nature of our business 
a significant portion of our sales are made to customers located outside the us  primarily in europe and asia 
in  and  without taking account of revenues derived from discontinued operations    and  respectively  of our revenues  including the revenues of ies and mdt on a pro forma basis  were derived from sales to customers located outside the us we expect that our international customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future 
sales to international customers may be subject to political and economic risks  including political instability  currency controls  exchange rate fluctuations  foreign taxes  longer payment cycles and changes in import export regulations and tariff rates 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation have been and in the future may be proposed in the us and certain other countries 
any resulting changes in current tariff structures or other trade and monetary policies could adversely affect our sales to international customers 
we may be subject to increased united states taxation 
we believe that electric fuel and our wholly owned israeli subsidiary efl will be treated as personal holding companies for purposes of the personal holding company phc rules of the internal revenue code of under the phc rules  a phc is subject to a special tax on its undistributed phc income  in addition to regular income tax 
we believe that electric fuel and efl have not had any material undistributed phc income 
however  no assurance can be given that electric fuel and efl will not have undistributed phc income in the future 
approximately of the stock of efl was deemed to be beneficially owned directly or indirectly by application of certain attribution rules as of december  by four united states citizens leon s 
gross  austin w 
marxe and david m 
greenhouse  and robert s 
ehrlich see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management information with respect to the stockholdings of messrs 
marxe and greenhouse is based on a schedule g filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   as amended on february  
if more than of either i the voting power of our stock  or ii the total value of our stock  is ever acquired or deemed to be acquired by five or fewer individuals including  if applicable  those individuals who currently own an aggregate of of our shares who are united states citizens or residents  efl would satisfy the foreign personal holding company fphc stock ownership test under the internal revenue code  and we could be subject to additional us taxes including phc tax on any undistributed fphc income of efl 
we believe that efl has not had any material undistributed fphc income 
however  no assurance can be given that efl will not become a fphc and have undistributed fphc income in the future 
investors should not purchase our common stock with the expectation of receiving cash dividends 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and  as a result  do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
market related risks the price of our common stock is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may change rapidly in the future 
the following factors  among others  may cause significant volatility in our stock price o announcements by us  our competitors or our customers  o the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by us or our competitors  o changes in the perceived ability to commercialize our technology compared to that of our competitors  o rumors relating to our competitors or us  o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  and o general market or economic conditions 
if our shares were to be delisted  our stock price might decline further and we might be unable to raise additional capital 
one of the continued listing standards for our stock on the nasdaq smallcap market is the maintenance of a bid price 
our stock price is currently trading below  and has been since october  on december   nasdaq notified us of our failure to meet the continued listing standards  and informed us that unless our stock closes for ten consecutive trading days with a bid price in excess of prior to march  subsequently extended  as a result of an amendment to nasdaq s listing regulations  to june   nasdaq would notify us of its intent to delist our stock from the nasdaq national market 
should nasdaq notify us of its intent to delist our stock  we would have the opportunity to appeal this notification  although there can be no assurances that this appeal would be resolved favorably 
there can be no assurance that our common stock will remain listed on the nasdaq national market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq national market  we might apply to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  however  there can be no assurance that we would be approved for listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has the same minimum bid and other similar requirements as the nasdaq national market 
if we were to move to the nasdaq smallcap market  current nasdaq regulations would give us the opportunity to obtain an additional day grace period and an additional day grace period after that if we meet certain net income  shareholders equity or market capitalization criteria 
while our stock would continue to trade on the over the counter bulletin board following any delisting from the nasdaq  any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of  and the efficiency of the trading market for  our common stock 
also  if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public equity markets 
in addition  if we fail to maintain nasdaq listing for our securities  and no other exclusion from the definition of a penny stock under the exchange act is available  then any broker engaging in a transaction in our securities would be required to provide any customer with a risk disclosure document  disclosure of market quotations  if any  disclosure of the compensation of the broker dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market values of our securities held in the customer s account 
the bid and offer quotation and compensation information must be provided prior to effecting the transaction and must be contained on the customer s confirmation 
if brokers become subject to the penny stock rules when engaging in transactions in our securities  they would become less willing to engage in transactions  thereby making it more difficult for our stockholders to dispose of their shares 
we are subject to significant influence by some stockholders that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
as of february   our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates including leon s 
gross  austin w 
marxe and david m 
greenhouse  ies electronics industries ltd 
and robert s 
ehrlich collectively are deemed beneficially to own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock see item security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management  including options and warrants exercisable within days of february  information with respect to the stockholdings of messrs 
marxe and greenhouse is based on a schedule g filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   as amended on february   and information with respect to the stockholdings of ies electronics industries ltd 
is based on a schedule d filed with the securities and exchange commission on august   as amended on october  and january  
as a result  these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying  preventing or discouraging a change in control of electric fuel 
pursuant to a voting rights agreement dated september   as amended  between leon s 
gross  robert s 
ehrlich  yehuda harats and us  lawrence m 
miller  mr 
gross s advisor  is entitled to be nominated to serve on our board of directors so long as mr 
gross  his heirs or assigns retain beneficial ownership of at least  shares of common stock 
in addition  under the voting rights agreement  mr 
gross and messrs 
ehrlich and harats agreed to vote and take all necessary action so that messrs 
ehrlich  harats and miller shall serve as members of the board of directors until the earlier of december  or our fifth annual meeting of stockholders after december  mr 
harats resigned as a director in  however  we believe that mr 
harats must continue to comply with the terms of this agreement 
a substantial number of our shares are available for sale in the public market and sales of those shares could adversely affect our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market  or the perception that those sales could occur  could adversely affect our stock price or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
of these shares   are freely transferable without restriction under the securities act of and  may be sold subject to the volume restrictions  manner of sale provisions and other conditions of rule under the securities act of in connection with a stock purchase agreement dated september  between leon s 
gross and us  we also entered into a registration rights agreement with mr 
gross dated september   setting forth registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued to mr 
gross in connection with the offering 
these rights include the right to make two demands for the registration of the shares of our common stock owned by mr 
gross 
in addition  mr 
gross was granted unlimited rights to piggyback on registration statements that we file for the sale of our common stock 
mr 
gross presently owns  shares  of which  have never been registered 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of their employment agreements with us  both yehuda harats and robert s 
ehrlich have a right to demand registration of their shares 
of the shares owned by mr 
harats   shares have never been registered  and of the  shares owned by mr 
ehrlich   shares have never been registered 
exercise of our warrants  options and convertible debt could adversely affect our stock price and will be dilutive 
as of february   there were outstanding warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  of which  were vested and exercisable within days of such date  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  and outstanding debentures and promissory notes convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average conversion price of per share 
holders of our options  warrants and convertible debt will probably exercise or convert them only at a time when the price of our common stock is higher than their respective exercise or conversion prices 
accordingly  we may be required to issue shares of our common stock at a price substantially lower than the market price of our stock 
this could adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  if and when these shares are issued  the percentage of our common stock that existing stockholders own will be diluted 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions o divide our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  o only permit removal of directors by stockholders for cause  and require the affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding common stock to so remove  and o allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders 
the classification system of electing directors and the removal provision may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may maintain the incumbency of our board of directors  as the classification of the board of directors increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors 
these provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers  delaying changes in our control or management  or may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions 
the amendment of any of these provisions would require approval by holders of at least of the outstanding common stock 
israel related risks a significant portion of our operations takes place in israel  and we could be adversely affected by the economic  political and military conditions in that region 
the offices and facilities of two of our principal subsidiaries  efl and mdt  are located in israel in beit shemesh and lod  respectively  both of which are within israel s pre borders 
we conduct research and development activities through efl  and most of our senior management is located at efl s facilities 
although we expect that most of our sales will be made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly affected by economic  political and military conditions in that country 
accordingly  any major hostilities involving israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its present trading partners could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
historically  arab states have boycotted any direct trade with israel and to varying degrees have imposed a secondary boycott on any company carrying on trade with or doing business in israel 
although in october  the states comprising the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  kuwait  dubai  bahrain and oman announced that they would no longer adhere to the secondary boycott against israel  and israel has entered into certain agreements with egypt  jordan  the palestine liberation organization and the palestinian authority  israel has not entered into any peace arrangement with syria or lebanon 
moreover  since september  there has been a significant deterioration in israel s relationship with the palestinian authority  and a significant increase in terror and violence 
efforts to resolve the problem have failed to result in an agreeable solution 
continued hostilities between the palestinian community and israel and any failure to settle the conflict may have a material adverse effect on our business and us 
moreover  the current political and security situation in the region has already had an adverse effect on the economy of israel  which in turn may have an adverse effect on us 
many of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israel defense forces and are subject to being called for active military duty at any time 
no assessment can be made of the full impact of such requirements on us in the future  particularly if emergency circumstances occur  and no prediction can be made as to the effect on us of any expansion of these obligations 
however  further deterioration of hostilities with the palestinian community into a full scale conflict might require more widespread military reserve service by some of our employees  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities on us and our officers may be difficult to obtain 
we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and will be subject to service of process in the united states 
however  approximately of our assets are located outside the united states 
in addition  two of our directors and all of our executive officers are residents of israel and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such directors and executive officers are located outside the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability of civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  in original actions instituted in israel 
however  subject to certain time limitations and other conditions  israeli courts may enforce final judgments of united states courts for liquidated amounts in civil matters  including judgments based upon the civil liability provisions of the securities act and the exchange act 
as a result  it may not be possible for investors to enforce or effect service of process upon these directors and executive officers or to judgments of us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of us laws against our assets  as well as the assets of these directors and executive officers 
in addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the us or elsewhere may be unenforceable in israel 
any failure to obtain the tax benefits from the state of israel that we expect to receive could negatively impact our plans and prospects 
we benefit from various israeli government programs  grants and tax benefits  particularly as a result of the approved enterprise status of a substantial portion of our existing facilities and the receipt of grants from the office of the chief scientist of the israeli ministry of industry and trade 
to be eligible for some of these programs  grants and tax benefits  we must continue to meet certain conditions  including producing in israel and making specified investments in fixed assets 
if we fail to meet such conditions in the future  we could be required to refund grants already received  adjusted for inflation and interest 
from time to time  the government of israel has discussed reducing or eliminating the benefits available under approved enterprise programs 
we cannot assure you that these programs and tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the government of israel has announced that programs receiving approved enterprise status in and thereafter will be entitled to a lower level of government grants than was previously available 
the termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits particularly benefits available to us as a result of the approved enterprise status of a substantial portion of our existing facilities and approved programs and as a recipient of grants from the office of the chief scientist could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  efl has granted a floating lien that is  a lien that applies not only to assets owned at the time but also to after acquired assets over all of efl s assets as a security to the state of israel to secure its obligations under the approved enterprise programs 
our grants from the israeli government impose certain restrictions on us 
since  our israeli subsidiary  efl  has received funding from the office of the chief scientist of the israel ministry of industry and trade relating to the development of our zinc air battery products  such as our electric vehicle and our batteries and chargers for consumer products 
between and  we have also received funds from the israeli us bi national industrial research and development bird foundation 
through the end of  we have received an aggregate of million from grants from the chief scientist and  from grants from bird  and we may receive future grants  the amounts of which would be determined at the time of application 
the funding from the chief scientist prohibits the transfer or license of know how and the manufacture of resulting products outside of israel without the permission of the chief scientist 
although we believe that the chief scientist does not unreasonably withhold this permission if the request is based upon commercially justified circumstances and any royalty obligations to the chief scientist are sufficiently assured  the matter is solely within the discretion of the chief scientist  and we cannot be sure that such consent  if requested  would be granted upon terms satisfactory to us or granted at all 
without such consent  we would be unable to manufacture any products developed by this research outside of israel  even if it would be less expensive for us to do so 
additionally  current regulations require that  in the case of the approved transfer of manufacturing rights out of israel  the maximum amount to be repaid through royalty payments would be increased to between and of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel  and that an increased royalty rate of up to would be applied 
these restrictions could adversely affect our potential revenues and net income from the sale of such products 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the israeli nis may negatively affect our earnings 
although a substantial majority of our revenues and a substantial portion of our expenses are denominated in us dollars  a significant portion of our costs  including personnel and facilities related expenses  is incurred in new israeli shekels nis 
inflation in israel will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in israel  unless it is offset on a timely basis by a devaluation of the nis relative to the dollar 
some of our agreements are governed by israeli law 
israeli law governs both our agreement with ies and our agreement with mdt  as well as certain other agreements  such as our lease agreements on our subsidiaries premises in israel 
while israeli law differs in certain respects from american law  we do not believe that these differences materially adversely affect our rights or remedies under these agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our international sales  production and funding requirements 
our research  development and production activities are primarily carried out by our israeli subsidiary  efl  at its facility in beit shemesh  and accordingly we have sales and expenses in new israeli shekels 
additionally  our mdt subsidiary operates primarily in new israeli shekels 
however  the majority of our sales are made outside israel in us dollars  and a substantial portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars 
therefore  our functional currency is the us dollar 
please see impact of inflation and currency fluctuations  above and note b to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although we have a line of credit that may be affected by interest rate changes  given our level of borrowing  we do not believe the market risk from interest rate changes is material
