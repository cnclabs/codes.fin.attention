item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s principal business is conducted by the banks and consists of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  other income  and other expenses 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains  mortgage origination fees  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust fees  and other income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  marketing expenses  and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the company s asset liability management procedures in coping with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is dependent upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
other expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new banking centers and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage  and other miscellaneous expenses

two of the borrower s affiliated companies the affiliated companies that provided collateral for the loans are the subject of pending voluntary bankruptcy proceedings initiated under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in july the total credit relationship to this borrower consisted of loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million as of december  in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis  management considers a number of factors including  among other things  regulatory review of its loan portfolio 
the federal reserve and the obre concluded that the loans described above should be classified as nonaccrual loans as of september  and december   due to the regulators assessment that the ultimate collectibility of the loans as of the end of the third and fourth quarters was doubtful 
as a result of further communications with the federal reserve and obre through early april  and additional internal analysis of available information  the company reclassified the million of loans as nonaccrual loans as of september  the company filed an amended form q on april   to reflect the reclassification and to restate its interim financial statements for the period ended september   to record an additional loan loss provision consistent with its loan loss reserve

on march   the bank received proceeds of approximately million from the nonrecourse sale of a of of the loans reclassified as nonaccrual as of september  to a newly formed entity that will be the sole owner of the affiliated companies following the emergence of these companies from bankruptcy 
the purchase price for the portion of the loans sold was equal to the stated principal amount of million as of september   million of additional financing as of december   plus accrued interest and late charges

a plan of reorganization was submitted to the bankruptcy court on march   and a hearing on the plan is scheduled for may  effectiveness of the plan of reorganization is dependent upon  among other things  the purchaser of the loans from the bank obtaining additional credit in the amount of million to fund the payment of certain additional indebtedness of the affiliated companies 
during march  the board of directors of the bank considered and approved a proposal for extension of such credit  but management of the bank has indicated that no commitment to extend such credit has been issued and that the bank presently has no plans to extend such credit 
in an april  letter to the 
table of contents company  the federal reserve and the obre indicated that they would require the bank to reserve which could be treated as an other expense for financial reporting purposes as of march   on a dollar for dollar basis up to million  if the bank had issued a commitment to extend such loan or if representations had been made to the bankruptcy court of the bank s willingness to provide credit to fund a plan of reorganization for the borrowers 
the company is presently in discussions with the federal reserve and obre concerning this matter 
on march   the banking regulators commenced a regularly scheduled examination of the bank which is not yet completed 
the ongoing examination has involved further review of the adequacy of the bank s overall risk management practices 
there can be no assurance that the federal reserve and obre will not identify other items which may have an impact on the financial statements of the company 
the following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the periods indicated 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
discussed below are those critical accounting policies that are of particular significance to the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the allowance balance required based on past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments  and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
there is no ready market for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments 
accordingly  fair values are based on various factors relative to expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk 
table of contents characteristics  and other factors 
the assumptions and estimates used in the fair value determination process are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  fair values cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates

the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis increased from in to for the primary reason for the increase in net interest margin was attributable to the decrease in yields on interest bearing liabilities being more than the decrease in yields on earnings assets

table of contents consumer installment loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   an increase of 
although the risk of nonpayment for any reason exists with respect to all loans  certain other more specific risks are associated with each type of loan 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the quality of the borrower s management  financial strength and cash flow resources  and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type  such as commercial or residential  and fluctuating land and property values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan  as well as the risk a borrower may become unemployed as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
at the end of  the company had of its loan portfolio in commercial and consumer real estate loans  of these real estate loans are variable rate and of these real estate loans are fixed rate 
the company believes that most credits should have both a primary and a secondary source of repayment  and that the primary source should generally be supported by operating cash flows  while the secondary source should generally be disposition of collateral 
the company engages in very little unsecured lending and generally requires personal guarantees of principals for business obligations 
the company practices a system of concurrence in the approval of commercial credit whereby the documented approval of an officer s credit committee or approval by the board or a board committee  where applicable is obtained in addition to that of the recommending officer 
this system is intended to ensure that commercial credit is subjected to an independent objective review on at least two different levels 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  one year years over years or less fixed variable fixed variable total in thousands commercial commercial real estate agricultural consumer real estate consumer installment total loans  gross unearned discount total loans nonperforming loans the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio  unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there are serious doubts regarding the collectibility of all principal and interest due under the terms of the loans based on the company s analysis of all available information  internal loan reviews  independent loan reviews  and information provided by regulatory loan reviews 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest after all of the principal has been collected 
a loan is generally transferred to nonaccrual status if 
table of contents it is not in the process of collection and is delinquent in payment of either principal or interest beyond days 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
 the company defined loans that are individually evaluated for impairment to include commercial loans and mortgages secured by commercial properties or five plus family residences that are in nonaccrual status or were restructured 
all other smaller balance loans with similar attributes such as auto are evaluated for impairment in total 
the classification of a loan as impaired or nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans 
the final determination as to the steps taken is made based upon the specific facts of each situation 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans that are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of the related collateral by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations require an increase to be made to the allowance for loan losses  such increase is reported as a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are evaluated for impairment when payments are delinquent days or more or when management downgrades the loan classification to doubtful 
the following table sets forth information on the company s nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets as of the indicated dates

table of contents analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the banks meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
each loan officer grades these individual commercial credits  and the company s independent loan review function validates the officers grades 
in the event that loan review downgrades the loan  it is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg  collateral value is nominal 
the analysis of the allowance for loan losses is comprised of three components specific credit allocation  general portfolio allocation  and subjectively by determined allocation 
the specific credit allocation includes a detailed review of the credit in accordance with sfas no 
and no 
 and an allocation is made based on this analysis 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the credit rating of the loan and charge off history 
the subjective portion is determined based on loan history and the company s evaluation of various factors including economic and industry outlooks 
in addition  the subjective portion of the allowance is influenced by current economic conditions and trends in the portfolio including delinquencies and impairments  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years

in both transactions  the underlying asset backed security is billion and is diversified amongst companies 
as of december   the company held no securities of a single issuer with a book value exceeding of stockholders equity other than those of the us treasury or other us government agencies 
the company s securities portfolio on an amortized cost basis increased million  or  in compared to a million increase in the change was attributed to the generation of new deposits and additional borrowings in excess of the loan funding and operational requirements of the banks 
during  the company increased its securities portfolio by increasing its holdings in us treasuries and agencies and obligations of political subdivisions by million and million from the prior year  respectively 
this increase is a result of investing the accumulation of new deposits and borrowings 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of agency guaranteed  mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities represented   and of total securities as of december    and  respectively 
based upon the company s evaluation  mortgage backed securities are a preferable investment vehicle for the banks 
mortgage backed securities offer attractive yields  provide monthly cash flows  serve as acceptable collateral  and have most of the liquidity characteristics of us treasury notes and bonds 
the banks investment strategies during the past three years have been focused on the purchase of seasoned and new production mortgage backed securities of moderate average lives to years  which have been purchased at discounts  at par  and at a premium to par 
historically  management believes these securities are reasonably predictable in terms of price volatility  prepayment speeds  and monthly cash flows 
the sharp decrease in long term investment yields and  as a consequence  lower mortgage rates  led to a significant increase in prepayment speeds in and as a result  management repositioned the securities portfolio in to reduce the overall impact on yields and improve longer term profitability 
during the third quarter of  the company reclassified 
table of contents million of its mortgage backed securities from available for sale to held to maturity under permissible provisions of fasb in order to enhance its interest rate risk position 
the company manages its securities available for sale portfolio and trading account portfolio on a total return basis 
in this respect  management regularly reviews the performance of its securities and sells specific securities to provide opportunities to enhance net interest income and net interest margin  and when possible it will recognize gains on the sale of securities 
the company has a long history of managing its securities in this manner 
during  the company experienced an above average level of refinancing activity on its mortgage backed securities

capital resources the company monitors compliance with bank and bank holding company regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent upon the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
included in the risk based capital method are two measures of capital adequacy  tier  or core capital  and total capital  which consists of tier plus tier capital 
see business supervision and regulation bank holding company regulation for definitions of tier and tier capital

in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity 
the banks have used the fhlb extensively since in  fhlb advances decreased by million 
assuming that collateral is available to secure loans  each bank can borrow up to of its assets with the fhlb  which provided the banks with a total additional million in unused capacity at december  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current and future liquidity needs 
the banks also have various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to billion of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements  and brokered certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was billion at december  the banks maintain these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk  and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several bases  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and also by the significant representation of retail credit and residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio

all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated with a volatile interest rate environment 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
in january  the company entered into a plain vanilla interest rate swap with a counterparty in order to convert its million of outstanding trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures from a fixed rate instrument into floating rate debt 
the average yield on the million trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures was for the first nine months of during july of  the company terminated the fair value hedge in exchange for  approximately  of this amount was determined to be due to hedge ineffectiveness and recognized into income in the third quarter 
the remaining amount is being accreted into income  as a reduction of interest expense  over the estimated life of the junior subordinated debentures 
the company enters into hedging activities to float interest payments of some of its fixed rate liabilities 
as of december   the company has various swap transactions  which results in the company converting million of its federal home loan bank advance fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the swap transactions require payment of interest by the company at the one month libor plus a spread and  in turn  the company receives a fixed rate 
the company has documented these to be 
table of contents fair value hedges qualifying for the shortcut method of accounting 
see note to the audited financial statements 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms  and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for each of the banks internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of each of the banks assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of each of the banks rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of each of the banks and the effects of rate changes on each of the banks earnings and market value 
the banks exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the company s board of directors 
each of the banks also maintains specific interest rate risk management policy limits 
based upon simulation modeling  these guidelines include a change in net interest income upon an immediate or gradual basis point change in interest rates 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings  and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and asset liability management

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s overall interest rate sensitivity is demonstrated by net interest income analysis 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decrease in market interest rates

net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp base bp net interest income dollar rate amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp base bp bp as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or approximately million 
overall net interest income sensitivity has decreased slightly from to  but remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
this decreased sensitivity was due to the changes in interest rates that affected various earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
due to the level of interest rates at december   the company is not able to model an additional basis point decrease in rates 
as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the company s net income by  or approximately million 
the effect of an immediate basis point decrease in rates would decrease the company s net interest income by  or approximately million
