since commencing operations as a peterbilt heavy duty truck dealer over years ago  we have grown to operate rush truck centers at locations  which primarily sell peterbilt class heavy duty trucks in the states of texas  colorado  oklahoma  california  louisiana  florida  arizona and new mexico 
our rush truck centers are strategically located to take advantage of increased cross border traffic between the united states and mexico resulting from implementation of nafta in during  our rush truck center division accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues 
rush equipment center division

we sold our five michigan construction equipment stores during  recording a net loss from discontinued operations of million see note of item 
at our rush equipment center in houston  texas  we will continue to provide a full line of construction equipment for light to medium sized applications 
our primary products include the following john deere backhoe loaders  hydraulic excavators  crawler dozers and four wheel drive loaders 
during  our texas store  which will remain in operation  accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues 
rush leasing and rental division 
we provide a broad line of product selections for lease or rent  including class  class and class peterbilt trucks  a full array of john deere construction equipment products  including a variety of construction equipment trailers and heavy duty cranes 
our lease and rental fleets are offered primarily through our rush truck centers and rush equipment centers on a daily  monthly or long term basis 
during  our rush leasing and rental division accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues 
rush financial and insurance division 
we offer third party financing to assist customers in purchasing a new or used truck or piece of construction equipment 
additionally  we sell a complete line of property and casualty insurance  including collision and liability insurance on trucks  cargo insurance  standard automobile liability coverages  and life insurance 
during  our rush financial and insurance division accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues 
we were founded and incorporated in in texas and our three senior executives jointly have years of experience in the industry 
we currently conduct business through numerous subsidiaries  all of which are wholly owned  directly or indirectly  by us 
our principal offices are at ih south  new braunfels  texas  industry overview we currently operate in two principal markets  heavy duty trucks and construction equipment markets  which for new product sales have historically shown a high correlation to the rate of change in industrial production and gross domestic product 
heavy duty truck market we serve the domestic us heavy duty truck market  which we estimate exceeded billion in retail sales during the company s business  as well as the entire retail heavy duty truck industry  is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  government regulation  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
according to data published by r 
l 
polk  an industry research and publication firm  the overall domestic heavy duty truck market decreased from approximately  new class defined by the american automobile manufactures association as trucks with a minimum gross vehicle weight rating above  pounds unit sales in to approximately  new class unit sales in a compounded decrease 
during  domestic heavy duty truck sales decreased approximately from and are expected to remain flat at approximately  units during within this market  our primary product line is peterbilt trucks  which according to r 
l 
polk accounted for approximately of all new heavy duty truck registrations in within our primary markets  according to r 
l 
polk  peterbilt trucks achieved an average market share  substantially higher than their national average 
as a result of our aggressive sales approach  new store openings and acquisitions in new markets  our share of the heavy duty truck market increased from  new unit sales in  or approximately of the overall heavy duty market share in the domestic united states  to  new unit sales in  for an overall domestic market share of 
typically  class trucks are assembled by the manufacturer utilizing certain components manufactured by other companies  including engines transmissions  axles  wheels and other components 
as trucks and truck components have become increasingly complex  including the use of computerized controls and diagnostic systems  the ability to provide state of the art service for a wide variety of truck equipment has become a competitive factor in the industry 
such service requires a significant capital investment in advanced equipment  parts inventory and a high level of training of service personnel 
additionally  environmental protection agency epa and department of transportation dot regulatory guidelines for service processes  including body shop  paint work and waste disposal  require sophisticated operating and testing equipment to ensure compliance with environmental and safety standards 
additionally  we believe that the trend towards increased lease rental sales will continue as fleets  particularly private ones  seek to establish full service leases or rental contracts under which the lessor rental company provides a turn key service including equipment  maintenance  and potentially  fuel  fuel tax reporting and other services 
as a result  differentiation between truck dealers has become less dependent on pure price competition and is increasingly based on their ability to offer a wide variety of trucking services 
these include the ability to provide easily accessible  efficient and sophisticated truck service and replacement parts  the ability to offer financing for truck purchases  leasing and rental programs and the ability to accept multiple unit trade ins related to large fleet purchases 
we believe our one stop concept and the size and diversity of our dealer network gives us a competitive advantage in providing these trucking services 
the environmental protection agency epa  mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of a new heavy duty truck approximately  to  per unit and possibly reduced the operating efficiency and life of the truck 
as a result  the company experienced stronger than expected truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
the company also anticipates a short term decline in truck sales during the first half of as a result of the pre buy experienced during the last half of subsequent to the expected short term decline in sales of class trucks caused by the change in emission laws  the company expects industry sales to improve during the second half of the heavy duty truck industry as a whole  expects to deliver approximately  new trucks domestically during  compared to approximately  and  new trucks during and  respectively 
these and totals are the lowest industry sales totals in the last eight years 
an oversupply of used trucks have adversely affected truck buyers in the last two years 
the oversupply of used trucks results in fewer new truck sales  has had a negative impact on used truck values of up to  and a corresponding decrease in finance and insurance revenues for the company 
while we believe that we industry will begin to improve during the second half of  and that we will perform at a level above our competitors  industry factors will negatively impact our business 
management believes the long term growth prospects for the heavy duty truck industry remain positive 
factors  which management believes favor the continued long term growth in trucking  include the following growth in demand for consumer and industrial goods in part as a result of the internet which has fostered a desire by consumers to receive a wider selection of packages sooner  competitive pressures for just in time manufacturing processes where us manufacturers are demanding faster  yet less costly  small shipment services  deregulation in the trucking industry leading to a proliferation of freight haulers  the rise of inter modal service which has established a symbiotic relationship between rail and truck service  and the significant increase of cross border truck traffic between mexico and the united states since nafta became effective in january of construction equipment market through our rush equipment centers  which are authorized john deere dealers  we serve the estimated billion north american market for retail sales of construction equipment targeted towards light and medium applications 
according to data compiled by john deere  approximately  units of construction equipment were put into use domestically in compared to  in however  in the market rush currently serves construction activity declined approximately from to the industry expects to sell approximately  construction equipment units in the united states during john deere has more than a market share in those product markets in which it has competitive products 
john deere s products are sold primarily through a distribution system composed of an estimated dealers as of december   compared to approximately dealers as of december   which operate approximately stores and service centers in north america 
john deere dealerships have the exclusive right to sell new john deere equipment and parts within their assigned area of responsibility  which means competition within a dealer s market comes primarily from dealers of competing manufacturers and  more recently  rental companies 
the customer base of john deere equipment users is diverse and includes residential and commercial construction businesses  independent rental companies  utility companies  government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply businesses 
industry statistics state that approximately of all construction equipment is owned by approximately of the customer base 
accordingly  john deere and its dealer group are aggressively developing more sophisticated ways to serve this large fleet owner 
market factors affecting the construction equipment industry include the following levels of commercial  residential  and public construction activities  state and federal highway and road construction appropriations  and the consolidation and growth of the rental business 
business strategy operating strategy 
our strategy is to operate integrated dealer networks that primarily market peterbilt heavy duty trucks or john deere construction equipment and provide complementary products and services  by emphasizing the following key elements one stop centers 
we have developed our truck and construction equipment locations as one stop centers where  at one convenient location  our customers can purchase new or used heavy duty trucks or construction equipment  finance  lease and or rent trucks or construction equipment  purchase after market parts and accessories and have service performed by factory certified technicians 
we believe that this full service strategy also helps to mitigate cyclical economic fluctuations because the parts and service sales at our rush centers generally tend to be less volatile than our new and used truck and construction equipment sales 
we intend to continue to emphasize this one stop concept 
branding program 
we employ a branding program for our facilities  designating each as a rush truck center or rush equipment center through distinctive signage and uniform marketing programs  in order to take advantage of our existing name recognition and to communicate the standardized high quality of our products and reliability of our services throughout our dealership networks 
our branding program extends to our services as well as our facilities 
for example  we recently initiated a prepaid truck maintenance program under the rush name  intended to encourage repeat service business at our rush truck centers 
we believe that this branding strategy will increase our market recognition and encourage our customers to utilize multiple locations throughout our dealership networks 
management by dealership units 
we measure and manage the business operations of each of our dealerships according to the specific business units operating at that location 
at each of our dealerships  we operate one or more of the following business units new sales  used sales  parts  service  leasing rental and financial services 
we believe that this system minimizes profit cannibalization across business units  thereby enhancing the profitability of all aspects of a dealership and increasing our overall operating margins 
operating goals are established annually and managers are rewarded for performance accordingly 
integrated management information systems 
in order to efficiently operate separate business units within each dealership  we rely upon our management information systems to determine and monitor appropriate inventory levels and product mix at each rush center 
each rush center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system that is accessible simultaneously by all locations 
our automated reordering system assists each rush center in maintaining the proper inventory levels and permits inventory delivery to each location  or directly to customers  typically within hours from the time the order is placed 
in addition  by actively monitoring market conditions  assessing product and expansion strategies and remaining abreast of changes within the market  we are able to proactively address market by market changes by realigning and  if necessary  adding product lines and models 
growth strategy 
through the implementation of our expansion and acquisition initiatives  we have grown to operate a large  multi state  full service dealership network in the heavy duty truck markets 
we intend to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisitions by expanding the product offerings available at  and capabilities of  our existing rush truck and rush equipment center  opening new rush truck and rush equipment centers in under served markets within geographic areas we currently serve  and acquiring and re branding existing third party dealerships within new  strategically located geographic areas 
expansion of product offerings and capabilities 
we intend to continue to expand our product lines within our rush truck and rush equipment centers by adding those product categories which are both complementary to our peterbilt and john deere product lines and well suited to the rush operating model 
historically  we expanded into the construction equipment industry based on a common customer base among our heavy duty truck and construction equipment purchasers 
we have also introduced trailer repair and maintenance services at many of our rush truck centers 
other recent product line expansions include introducing cranes into our rush equipment centers and peterbilt class and class medium duty trucks into our rush truck centers 
we believe that there are many additional examples of similar product and service offerings that complement our primary product lines 
any product category expansion we pursue must satisfy our requirements that the products are of a premium brand  products provide opportunities for incremental income through related servicing  after market sales or financing  and rush operating controls can be implemented to enhance the financial performance of the business 
open new rush truck and equipment centers in existing markets 
we believe that there are opportunities to increase our share of the heavy duty truck and construction equipment markets by introducing our one stop centers to under served markets within the southwest united states 
additional dealerships would enable us to enhance revenues from our existing customer base as well as increase the awareness of the rush brand name for new buyers 
we believe there would also be opportunities for cost savings by integrating the inventory management and operations of these new locations with those of our existing networks 
expand into new geographic areas 
we plan to continue to expand our rush truck center network and build a rush equipment center network by acquiring additional dealerships in geographic areas contiguous to our current operations or otherwise strategically located along major interstate highways 
thus far  we have successfully expanded our presence from our texas base into the southwest and  more recently  in florida 
we believe the geographic diversity of our networks has significantly expanded our customer base while ameliorating the effects of certain local economic cycles 
geographic diversification supports the sale of heavy duty trucks  construction equipment and related parts by allowing us to allocate our inventory among the geographic regions we serve based on market demand 
in identifying new areas for expansion  we analyze the target market s level of new heavy duty truck registrations and construction equipment purchases  customer buying and leasing trends and the existence of competing franchises 
we also assess the potential performance of a parts and service center to determine whether a market is suitable for a rush dealership 
after a market has been strategically reviewed  we survey the region for a well situated location 
whether we acquire existing dealerships or open new rush locations  we will introduce the rush branding program and implement our integrated management system 
geographic expansion is a primary means by which we intend to continue to grow our core business

the d d farm and ranch supermarkets in seguin  and hockley  texas occupy  and  square feet  respectively  of building space 
we also own and operate a ranch of approximately  acres in cotulla  texas 
rush operating divisions we are managed and operated though four distinct divisions  which are described below 
rush truck center division our rush truck center division is the operating division responsible for sales of new and used heavy duty trucks  as well as related parts and services 
new truck sales 
new heavy duty truck sales represent the largest portion of our business  accounting for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for rush truck centers primarily sell new class heavy duty peterbilt trucks  which constitute more than of all new trucks sold by us 
a new peterbilt class heavy duty truck typically sells at a premium  within a typical price range of  to  as compared to other class heavy duty trucks which typically sell within a price range of  to  the average delivery times for custom ordered new peterbilt trucks can vary between days to six months 
we also sell class peterbilt trucks  peterbilt refuse chassis and cement mixer chassis  gmc medium duty trucks and  at our oklahoma rush truck centers  volvo class heavy duty trucks 
our customers use heavy duty trucks to haul virtually all materials  including general freight  petroleum  wood products  refuse and construction materials for both over the road and off road applications 
approximately of our new truck sales are to fleet customers defined as customers who purchase more than five trucks in any single month period 
because of our large size  strong relationships with our fleet customers and ability to handle large quantities of used truck trade ins  we are able to successfully market and sell to fleets nationwide 
we believe that we have a competitive advantage over most other dealers in that we can absorb multi unit trade ins often associated with fleet sales of new trucks and effectively disperse the used trucks for resale throughout our dealership network 
we believe that our attention to customer service and our broad range of trucking services  including our ability to offer truck financing and insurance to our customers  has resulted in a high level of customer loyalty 
management believes that greater than of our truck sales during were to repeat customers 
used truck sales 
used truck sales accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for we primarily sell used class heavy duty trucks manufactured by the leading truck manufacturers in the industry  including peterbilt  kenworth truck co  a division of paccar  inc kenworth  freightliner corporation  a subsidiary of daimler chrysler ag freightliner  mack trucks  inc mack and navistar international corporation navistar 
our management believes that we are well positioned to market used heavy duty trucks due to our ability to recondition used trucks for resale utilizing the parts and service departments at our rush truck centers and to reallocate our used truck inventory from one rush truck center to another in order to satisfy customer demand 
a majority of our used truck fleet is comprised of trucks taken as trade ins from new truck customers to be used as all or part of such customer s down payment  with the remainder of our used truck fleet being purchased from third parties for resale 
truck parts and service 
truck related parts and service revenues accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for we are the sole authorized peterbilt parts and accessories supplier in each of the markets serviced by our rush truck centers 
the parts business augments our sales and service functions and is a source of recurring revenue 
each rush truck center carries in its inventory a wide variety of peterbilt and other truck parts  with an average of approximately  items from over suppliers at each location 
rush truck centers offer menu pricing of service and body shop functions and offer expedited service at a premium price for certain routine repair and maintenance functions 
our rush truck centers also feature various combinations of fully equipped service and body shop facilities  the configuration of which may vary by location  capable of handling a broad range of truck repairs on most makes and classes of trucks 
each rush truck center is a peterbilt designated warranty service center and most are also authorized service centers for other manufacturers  including the following caterpillar  inc  cummins engine  inc  detroit diesel corporation  eaton corporation and rockwell international corporation 
we have approximately service bays  including paint bays  throughout our rush truck center network 
we perform both warranty and non warranty service work  with the cost of the warranty work being reimbursed by the manufacturer at retail consumer rates 
we estimate that approximately of our truck service functions are performed under manufacturers warranties 
all service performed at our rush truck centers is done by technicians who have been certified by our suppliers 
we have a multi year prepaid program for certain truck maintenance services under the rush brand name  with guaranteed pricing and priority service at rush truck centers 
we believe that this program increases customer traffic  customer loyalty and enhances service and parts revenue 
rush equipment center division our rush equipment center division is the operating division responsible for sales of new and used construction equipment as well as related parts and services 
new construction equipment sales 
new construction equipment sales accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for our rush equipment centers carry a complete line of john deere construction equipment 
a new piece of john deere construction equipment typically ranges in price from  for a skidsteer to  for an excavator 
we augment our john deere product line by also carrying a full line of complementary construction equipment manufactured by other suppliers 
we sell to a diverse customer base including residential and commercial construction businesses  utility companies  government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply businesses 
we believe that many of our rush truck center customers also utilize construction equipment  and we aggressively market our construction equipment product offerings to these customers as well as to the regional truck fleets that we serve 
we believe that john deere s reputation for manufacturing quality construction equipment attracts new and repeat customers who value lower maintenance and repair costs and a higher residual value at trade in 
we augment this product loyalty with an operating strategy similar to our rush truck centers which focuses on providing fast  reliable service in a familiar setting 
as we expand our geographic presence  we believe that our operating strategy will enable us to both increase our customer base and generate repeat business for all product offerings 
used construction equipment sales 
used construction equipment sales accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for we sell used construction equipment manufactured by several of the leading manufacturers  including john deere  case corporation case  caterpillar  and komatsu  ltd 
komatsu 
the majority of our used construction equipment inventory is derived from our rental fleet  and we take the remainder as trade ins from our construction equipment customers  which affords us the opportunity to use our parts and service departments for reconditioning of used equipment 
construction equipment parts and service 
construction equipment related parts and service revenues accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for each rush equipment center carries in its inventory a wide variety of john deere and other parts  with over  items from over suppliers at most locations 
we are the sole authorized john deere parts and accessories supplier in our construction equipment market 
we also maintain a fully equipped john deere designated warranty service operation capable of handling repairs on most types of construction equipment at our rush equipment center 
we augment this presence with field service trucks and technicians who are capable of making on site repairs at our customers location 
rush leasing and rental division our rush leasing and rental division is the operating division responsible for the leasing and rental of heavy duty trucks and construction equipment 
truck leasing and rental 
truck leasing and rental revenues accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for we engage in full service peterbilt truck leasing under the paclease trade name at eight of our rush truck centers and are the largest paclease dealer in the united states 
one of the benefits of our leasing and rental division is that such customers provide an additional captive market for our parts and service operations by creating additional parts sales and service work at rush truck centers for trucks leased or rented by such customers 
all of our leases require all parts sales  service and maintenance for the leased trucks to be performed at our facilities or at facilities outside our service area  as we direct 
trucks subject to shorter term rentals are also generally serviced at our facilities 
we have increased our lease and rental fleet  including contract maintenance  from less than trucks in to approximately  trucks at december  as of december   we owned approximately of our lease and rental fleet  and leased the remaining trucks in our fleet directly from peterbilt 
currently  the average age of trucks in our lease and rental fleet is approximately months 
generally  we hold trucks in our lease and rental fleet for approximately five years and then sell such used trucks to the public through our used sales operations at our rush truck centers 
historically we have realized gains on the sale of such trucks in excess of the cost of the purchase option contained in our leases with peterbilt or the book value of trucks owned by the company 
based on industry conditions  we expect these gains to be minimal in  which will adversely affect the profitability of this division 
construction equipment rental 
construction equipment rental revenues accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for our rental contracts require that all parts sales  service and maintenance for our rental construction equipment be performed at our facilities or at other facilities as we direct 
thus  construction equipment rental customers create additional parts sales and service work at our rush equipment centers 
our construction equipment rental fleet consisted of approximately pieces of equipment as of december  currently  the average age of the construction equipment in our rental fleet is approximately months 
we offer our customers both long term and short term rentals  as well as rental purchase options 
we believe that our rental operations will continue to benefit from the current trend among our construction equipment customers to outsource operations  including construction equipment ownership  in order to minimize their capital investment in construction equipment  as well as reducing or eliminating the down time  maintenance  repair and storage costs associated with construction equipment ownership 
we believe that the availability of a well maintained rental fleet allows our customers to more effectively manage their business operations and assets by obtaining construction equipment on an as needed basis 
rush financial and insurance division our rush financial and insurance division is the operating division responsible for arranging third party financing and insurance for both our heavy duty truck and construction equipment product offerings 
we offer our customers products that assist them in purchasing new or used trucks and construction equipment 
this division  net of charge backs  accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our total revenues for and finance and insurance revenues are directly related to the sale of new and used trucks and construction equipment and will be adversely affected in should the sales decreases predicted for these industries be accurate 
finance and insurance revenues have limited direct costs and  therefore  contribute a disproportionate share of operating profits 
new and used truck and construction equipment financing 
primarily through citicapital  and paccar financial  we arranged customer financing for approximately million  or  of our total new and used truck sales in  an increase of from approximately million in approximately of these truck finance contracts related to new truck sales and the remainder related to used truck sales 
generally  truck finance contracts are memorialized through the use of installment contracts  which are secured by the trucks financed  and generally require a down payment of to of the value of the financed truck  with the remaining balance financed over a two to five year period 
in addition  through the cit group  citicapital  john deere credit and others  we arranged customer financing for approximately million  or approximately  of our total new and used construction equipment sales in approximately of these construction equipment finance contracts related to new construction equipment sales and the remainder related to used construction equipment sales 
generally  construction equipment finance contracts are memorialized through the use of installment or lease contracts  which are secured by the construction equipment financed  and generally require a down payment of to of the value of the financed piece of construction equipment  with the remaining balance being financed over a three to five year period 
all finance contracts for construction equipment are assigned without recourse 
our aggregate liability for repossession losses  excluding interest chargebacks  resulting from defaults is limited to  per year for contracts sold to citicapital and  per year for contracts sold to paccar financial 
historically  our losses have been significantly less than the amount of our total maximum recourse liability 
we experience no repossession loss on construction equipment finance contracts that we originate because such contracts are sold to third parties without recourse 
insurance agency services 
we sell a complete line of property and casualty insurance  including collision and liability insurance on trucks  cargo insurance  standard automobile liability insurance  life insurance  credit life insurance and health insurance  workers compensation insurance and homeowners insurance 
our agents are licensed in the states of texas  colorado  california  oklahoma  louisiana  arkansas  new mexico and alabama to sell insurance for various insurance companies  including citicapital insurance and motors insurance corporation  a subsidiary of gmc 
while our focus is on trucking related insurance products marketed to our customers  we also sell non trucking related insurance products to our customers as well as to the general public 
we experienced an average renewal rate of during sales and marketing our established expansion and acquisition strategy and long history of operations in the heavy duty truck business have resulted in a strong customer base that is diverse in terms of geography  industry and scale of operations 
our rush truck center customers include owner operators  regional and national fleets  corporations and local governments 
during  no single rush truck center customer accounted for more than of our total truck sales by dollar volume 
our rush equipment center s customer base is similarly diverse and  during  no single rush equipment center customer accounted for more than of our total construction equipment sales by dollar volume 
we generally promote our products and related services through our sales staff  trade magazine advertisements and attendance at industry shows 
we believe that the consistently reliable service received by our customers and our longevity and geographic diversity have resulted in increased market recognition of the rush brand name and have served to reinforce customer loyalty and continuing customer relationships 
during  approximately of our truck sales were to previous or existing customers 
in an effort to enhance our name recognition and to communicate the standardized high level of quality products and services provided at our rush centers  we implement our brand name concept at each of our dealerships  such that each of our dealerships is identified as either a rush truck center or rush equipment center 
currently  we are making a concerted effort to target our products and services to existing truck customers that are also involved in the construction business 
for example  in houston  texas we believe that approximately of our rush truck center customers have also been customers at the houston rush equipment center 
facility management personnel 
each rush truck and equipment center is managed by a general manager who oversees the operations  personnel and the financial performance of the location  subject to the direction of the company s corporate office 
each rush truck center is also typically staffed by a sales manager  parts manager  service manager  sales representatives  parts employees  and other service and make ready employees 
the sales staff of each rush truck and equipment center is compensated on a salary plus commission basis  with a high percentage of compensation based on commission  while the general manager  parts manager and service manager receive a combination of salary and performance bonus  with a high percentage of compensation based on the performance bonus 
the company believes that its employees are among the highest paid in their respective industries 
general managers annually prepare detailed monthly forecasts and monthly profit and loss statements based upon historical information and projected trends and an element of each general manager s compensation is determined by meeting or exceeding these operating plans 
during the year  general managers regularly review their facility s progress with senior management and make appropriate adjustments as needed 
all employees of the company undergo annual performance evaluations 
the company has been successful in retaining its senior management  general managers and other employees 
to promote communication and efficiency in operating standards  general managers and members of senior management attend several company wide strategy sessions per year 
in addition  management personnel attend various industry sponsored leadership and management seminars and receive continuing education on peterbilt products  john deere products  marketing strategies and management information systems 
members of senior management regularly travel to each location to provide on site management and support 
each location is audited regularly for administrative record keeping  human resources and environmental compliance matters 
the company has instituted succession planning pursuant to which employees in each rush truck and equipment center are groomed as assistant managers to assume management responsibilities in existing and future dealerships 
purchasing and suppliers 
the company believes that pricing is an important element of its marketing strategy 
because of its size  the rush truck center division benefits from volume purchases at favorable prices that permit it to achieve a competitive pricing position in the industry 
the company purchases its peterbilt heavy duty truck inventory and peterbilt parts and accessories directly from paccar 
all other manufacturers parts and accessories  including those of cummins  detroit diesel  caterpillar and others are purchased through wholesale vendors or from paccar  who buys such products in bulk for resale to the company and other peterbilt dealers 
all purchasing  volume and pricing levels and commitments are negotiated by the company s corporate headquarters 
the company has been able to negotiate favorable terms  which facilitates the company s ability to offer competitive prices for its products 
the company purchases all of its john deere construction equipment inventory and john deere parts directly from john deere 
all other construction equipment manufacturers parts and accessories are purchased through wholesale vendors by the company 
management believes as a network of rush equipment centers is developed  the company will be able to negotiate favorable price terms through volume purchasing  thereby achieve a competitive pricing position in the industry 
management information systems 
each rush truck and equipment center maintains a centralized real time inventory tracking system which is accessible simultaneously by all locations and by the company s corporate office 
the company utilizes the information assimilated from its management information systems to determine and monitor the appropriate inventory level at each facility 
from this information  management has developed a model reflecting historic sales levels of different product lines 
this information identifies the appropriate level and mix of inventory and forms the basis of the company s operating plan 
the company s management information systems and databases are also used to monitor market conditions  sales information and assess product and expansion strategies 
information received from state and regulatory agencies  manufacturers and industry contacts allows the company to determine market share statistics and gross volume sales numbers for its products as well as those of competitors 
this information impacts ongoing operations by allowing the company to remain abreast of changes within the market and allows management to react accordingly by realigning product lines and by adding new product lines and models 
distribution and inventory management 
the company utilizes its real time inventory management tracking system to maintain a close link between each rush truck center 
this link allows for a timely and cost effective sharing of managerial and sales information as well as the prompt transfer of inventory among various locations 
the transfer of inventory reduces delays in delivery  helps maximize inventory turns and assists in controlling problems created by overstock and understock situations 
the company is linked directly to its major suppliers  including paccar  gmc  and john deere via real time satellite or frame relay communication links for purposes of ordering and inventory management 
these automated reordering and satellite communication systems allow the company to maintain proper inventory levels and permit the company to have inventory delivered to its locations  or directly to customers  typically within hours of an order being placed 
recent acquisitions in february  the company acquired the common stock of orange county truck and trailers  inc orange county  a peterbilt dealer in central florida 
the acquisition provides rush with the exclusive rights to sell peterbilt trucks and parts from three new locations in central florida  including orlando  haines city  and tampa 
the transaction was valued at approximately million  with the purchase price paid in cash

the transaction was valued at approximately million with the purchase price paid in cash 
competition there is  and will continue to be  significant competition both within our current markets and in the new markets which we may enter 
we anticipate that competition between us and other dealers will continue to increase in both our current markets and on a national level  based on the following the accessibility of dealership locations  the number of dealership locations  price  value  quality and design of the products sold  and attention to customer service including technical service 
our heavy duty truck products compete with class and class trucks made by other manufacturers and sold through competing independent and factory owned truck dealerships  including trucks manufactured by navistar  mack  freightliner  kenworth  volvo  ford motor company  western star truck holdings  ltd  and other manufacturers 
kenworth heavy duty trucks  which are distributed through a different  competing dealer network  are also manufactured by paccar  peterbilt s parent company 
our construction equipment products compete with construction equipment manufactured by case  caterpillar and komatsu  as well as other manufacturers 
we believe that we are competitive in all of the dealer categories identified above  and that we are able to compete with manufacturer dealers  independent dealers and wholesalers  rental service companies and industrial auctioneers in distributing our products on the basis of overall product quality and reputation  rush name recognition and reputation for reliability  and our ability to provide comprehensive full parts and service support  as well as financing  insurance and other customer services 
dealership agreements peterbilt 
we have entered into non exclusive dealership agreements with peterbilt which authorize us to act as a dealer of peterbilt heavy duty trucks 
our areas of responsibility currently encompass locations in the states of california  colorado  texas  oklahoma  louisiana  arizona  florida and new mexico 
these dealership agreements have current terms expiring between february and december and impose certain operational obligations and financial requirements upon us and our dealerships 
these agreements are terminable by peterbilt upon a change of control of the company  as such term is described in each agreement  and grant peterbilt certain rights of first refusal relating to any sale or transfer by us of our dealership locations or if certain rush family members desire to sell more than  shares of our voting common stock within a month period to anyone other than family members or certain other specified persons 
any termination or non renewal of these dealership agreements by peterbilt must follow certain guidelines established by both state and federal legislation designed to protect dealers  such as us  from arbitrary termination or non renewal of franchise agreements

these john deere dealership agreements have no specified term or duration 
our current area of responsibility for the sale of john deere construction equipment is the greater houston  texas metropolitan area 
the john deere dealership agreements impose operational obligations and financial requirements the company 
like the dealership agreements with peterbilt  the dealership agreements with john deere are terminable upon change of control  grant certain rights of first refusal and impose certain financial requirements 
other truck suppliers 
in addition to our truck dealership agreements with peterbilt  we are also an authorized dealer for volvo at our rush truck centers in tulsa  oklahoma  and have non exclusive dealership agreements with gmc for the sale of gmc medium duty trucks at our rush truck centers in san antonio  texas  and oklahoma city and tulsa  oklahoma

the gmc dealership agreement is effective through october  both the gmc and volvo agreements impose operating requirements upon us and require consent from the affected supplier for sale or transfer of either such agreement 
other construction equipment suppliers 
in addition to john deere  we are an authorized dealer for suppliers of other construction equipment 
the terms of such arrangements vary  but most of these dealership agreements contain termination provisions allowing the supplier to terminate the agreement after a specified notice period usually days

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  including small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  trucks and parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the third and fourth quarters 
the company has historically received benefits from volume purchases and meeting vendor sales targets in the form of cash rebates  which are typically recognized when received 
approximately of such rebates are typically received in the fourth quarter  resulting in a seasonal increase in gross profit 
seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
seasonal effects on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors  for both residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
backlog on december  and  the company s backlog of truck orders was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company includes in backlog only confirmed orders 
it takes between days and six months for the company to receive delivery from paccar once an order is placed 
the company expects to fill at least of these orders by the end of the company sells approximately of its new heavy duty trucks by customer special order  with the remainder sold out of inventory 
included in the company s backlog as of december  and are orders from a number of the company s major fleet customers 
environmental standards and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment  primarily relating to our service operations 
the environmental protection agency epa  mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of a new heavy duty truck approximately  to  per unit and possibly reduced the operating efficiency and life of the truck 
as a result  the company experienced stronger than expected truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
the company also anticipates a short term decline in truck sales during the first half of as a result of the pre buy experienced during the last half of product warranties both peterbilt and john deere provide the retail purchasers of their products with a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship  excluding certain specified components which are separately warranted by the suppliers of such components 
we do not undertake to provide any warranty to our customers 
we generally sell our used trucks and construction equipment as is and without manufacturer s warranty  although manufacturers sometimes will provide a limited warranty on their used products if they have been properly reconditioned prior to resale or if the manufacturer s warranty on such product is transferable and has not yet expired 
we do not undertake to provide any warranty to our used truck or construction equipment customers 
trademarks the peterbilt  john deere  volvo and gmc trademarks and trade names  which are used in connection with our marketing and sales efforts  are subject to a limited license by us from each of the respective manufacturers 
these names are recognized internationally and are important in the marketing of our products 
each licensor engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in its marketing areas 
we hold a registered trademark with the u 
s 
patent and trademark office for the name rush 
employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we have no contracts or collective bargaining agreements with labor unions and have never experienced work stoppages 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
termination of dealership agreements upon a change of control a substantial percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of peterbilt trucks and john deere products 
therefore  our business is highly dependant on the paccar and john deere dealership agreements  which authorize us to sell peterbilt and john deere products in our market areas 
our dealership agreements with paccar are terminable by paccar in the event the aggregate voting power of mr 
w 
marvin rush mr 
rush and his family decreases below with respect to the election of directors 
the john deere dealership agreements would similarly be terminable by john deere if the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family were to decrease below 
as of march   mr 
rush and his family beneficially owned  shares of each of the class a common stock and the class b common stock  or approximately of the outstanding voting power 
the company has no control over the transfer or disposition of the shares of common stock by mr 
rush or by mr 
rush s estate 
if mr 
rush were to sell his common stock or bequest his common stock to non family members or if mr 
rush s estate were required to liquidate shares of common stock of the company to pay estate taxes or otherwise  the change of control provisions of the dealership agreements described above would be triggered and could cause the company to lose its critical right to sell peterbilt and john deere products 
any loss of rights under its dealership agreements would have a severely adverse effect on the company s results of operations

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and by the first in  first out method for tires  parts and accessories 
an allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value 
other assets other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions and other intangible assets 
as stated in note  fasb statement no 
 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
statement no 
also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
the statement requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market condition  projected cash flows  interest rates and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement no 
requires  in lieu of amortization  an annual impairment review of goodwill 
the impact of adopting the statement  effective january   resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization  which would have approximated million of pretax amortization expense  from continuing operations during the company did not record an impairment charge related to the goodwill for its continuing operations at its initial review during the first quarter of or at its december  impairment review 
the company did  however  record an impairment of goodwill related to its discontinued operations at december  see note 
furthermore  sfas no 
exposes the company to the possibility that changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future  thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings volatility 
revenue recognition policies income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment collectively  unit is recognized when the seller and customer execute a purchase contract  delivery has occurred and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or collectibility 
finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of the respective finance contract  based on the effective interest rate method  if the finance contract is retained by the company 
during  and  no finance contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the company but were generally sold  with limited recourse  to certain finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit 
gain or loss is recognized by the company upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance companies  net of a provision for estimated repossession losses 
lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement

during  the company arranged customer financing for approximately of its total new and used truck sales  and derived approximately and of its finance revenues from the sale of new and used trucks  respectively 
the company s new and used truck financing is typically provided through citicapital and paccar financial 
the company financed approximately million of new and used truck purchases in the company s contracts with citicapital and paccar financial provide for payment to the company of all finance charges in excess of a negotiated discount rate within days of the date of financing  with such payments subject to offsets resulting from the early pay off or defaults under installment contracts previously initiated on behalf of and sold to citicapital and paccar financial by the company 
for contracts sold during  the company s aggregate liability for repossession losses  resulting from defaults is limited to  per year for contracts sold to citicapital and  per year for contracts sold to paccar financial 
in addition  through the cit group  citicapital  john deere credit and others  the company arranged customer financing for approximately million  or approximately  of our total new and used construction equipment sales in approximately of these construction equipment financings related to new construction equipment sales and the remainder related to used construction equipment sales 
generally  construction equipment financings are memorialized through the use of installment or lease contracts  which are secured by the construction equipment financed  and generally require a down payment of to of the value of the financed piece of construction equipment  with the remaining balance being financed over a three to five year period 
the company experiences no repossession loss on construction equipment financings because such financings are sold to third parties without recourse 
substantially all of the company s truck purchases from paccar are made on terms requiring payment within days or less from the date of shipment of the trucks from the factory 
the company finances all  or substantially all  of the purchase price of its new truck inventory  and of the loan value of its used truck inventory  under a floor plan arrangement with gmac under which gmac pays paccar directly with respect to new trucks 
the company makes monthly interest payments on the amount financed but is not required to commence loan principal repayments prior to sale on new vehicles to gmac for a period of months and for used vehicles for a period of three months 
at december   the company had approximately million outstanding under its floor plan financing arrangement with gmac

seasonality the company s heavy duty truck business is moderately seasonal 
seasonal effects on new truck sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base  which includes small and large fleets  governments  corporations and owner operators 
however  truck  parts and service operations historically have experienced higher volumes of sales in the second and third quarters 
the company has historically received benefits from volume purchases and meeting vendor sales targets in the form of cash rebates  which are typically recognized when received 
approximately of such rebates are typically received in the fourth quarter  resulting in a seasonal increase in gross profit 
seasonal effects in the construction equipment business are primarily driven by the weather 
seasonal effects on construction equipment sales related to the seasonal purchasing patterns of any single customer type are mitigated by the company s diverse customer base that includes contractors  for both residential and commercial construction  utility companies  federal  state and local government agencies  and various petrochemical  industrial and material supply type businesses that require construction equipment in their daily operations 
cyclicality the company s business  as well as the entire retail heavy duty truck industry  is dependent on a number of factors relating to general economic conditions  including fuel prices  interest rate fluctuations  economic recessions  government regulation and customer business cycles 
in addition  unit sales of new trucks have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variation based on such general economic conditions 
according to rl polk  industry wide domestic retail sales of heavy duty trucks totaled approximately  new truck registrations in the industry forecasts a slight increase in heavy duty new truck sales in although the company believes that its geographic expansion and diversification into truck related services  including financial services  leasing  rentals and service and parts  will reduce the overall impact to the company resulting from general economic conditions affecting heavy duty truck sales  the company s operations will continue to be adversely affected by any continuation or renewal of general downward economic pressures or adverse cyclical trends 
environmental standards and other governmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment 
the environmental protection agency epa  mandated that heavy duty engine manufacturers meet new  stricter emissions guidelines  regarding nitrous oxides  for all engines built subsequent to october  these new guidelines increased the price of a new heavy duty truck approximately  to  per unit and possibly reduced the operating efficiency and life of the truck 
as a result  the company experienced stronger than expected truck sales during the second half of as customers made purchases of trucks manufactured under the old emission laws 
the company also anticipates a short term decline in truck sales during the first half of as a result of the pre buy experienced during the last half of termination of dealership agreements upon a change of control as described in item business and this item  a substantial percentage of our revenues is derived from sales of peterbilt trucks and john deere products 
therefore  our business is highly dependant on the paccar and john deere dealership agreements  which authorize us to sell peterbilt and john deere products in our market areas 
our dealership agreements with paccar are terminable by paccar in the event the aggregate voting power of mr 
w 
marvin rush mr 
rush and his family decreases below with respect to the election of directors 
the john deere dealership agreements would similarly be terminable by john deere if the aggregate voting power of mr 
rush and his family were to decrease below 
as of december   mr 
rush and his family beneficially owned  shares of common stock  or approximately of the outstanding voting power 
the company has no control over the transfer or disposition of the shares of common stock by mr 
rush or by mr 
rush s estate 
if mr 
rush were to sell his common stock or bequest his common stock to non family members or if mr 
rush s estate were required to liquidate shares of common stock of the company to pay estate taxes or otherwise  the change of control provisions of the dealership agreements described above would be triggered and could cause the company to lose its critical right to sell peterbilt and john deere products 
any loss of rights under its dealership agreements would have a severely adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates  related to its floor plan borrowing arrangements  variable rate debt and discount rates related to finance sales 
floor plan borrowings are based on the prime rate of interest and are used to meet working capital needs 
as of december   the company had floor plan borrowings of approximately  assuming an increase in the prime rate of interest of basis points  interest expense could increase by approximately  the interest rate variability on all other debt would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
the company provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance providers 
the company receives all finance charges  in excess of a negotiated discount rate  from the finance providers within days 
the negotiated discount rate is variable  thus subject to interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk is mitigated by the company s ability to pass discount rate increases to customers through higher financing rates
