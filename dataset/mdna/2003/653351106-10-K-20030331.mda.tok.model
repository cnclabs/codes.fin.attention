item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a you should read the following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
md a overview we provide the services  software and support necessary for businesses and government agencies to extend existing and future applications from the desktop to almost all currently available personal digital assistant pda operating systems and their respective wireless devices 
through the aether fusion approach  we develop  deploy and manage wireless solutions built on industry standard technology and backed by our expertise in wireless hosting  software and services 
we are focused on several growth areas including enterprise services  mobile government  and transportation 
during  we expanded our products  services  and customer base in the transportation and logistics market through the acquisition of certain assets and licenses from track communications  inc track 
track is a leading provider of wireless based vehicle fleet management and intelligent mobile asset tracking solutions 
md a factors affecting comparability our results of operations in  and have been affected by acquisitions  investments and impairment charges 
the factors identified below have had a significant impact on our operations and should be considered in comparing our results of operations in to those in and in comparing our results of operations in to those in a acquisitions we have acquired companies to expand our product offerings and geographic markets and to acquire additional engineering resources to develop products 
through december   we acquired businesses or parts of businesses for an aggregate consideration of million in cash and equity valued at the time of acquisition of billion  consisting of  shares of our common stock and  replacement options 
in  we expanded our products  services  and customer base in the transportation and logistics market through the acquisition of certain assets and licenses from track 
track is a leading provider of wireless based vehicle fleet management and intelligent mobile asset tracking solutions 
the purchase consideration excluding approximately  of purchase related expenses was million consisting of million in cash and a million note payable 
the note was interest bearing at and was paid in equal monthly cash installments from may through july during the fourth quarter of  we purchased from reuters  their interest in sila  a european joint venture we formed with reuters in the results of sila s operation were consolidated with ours in  and as a result of this acquisition  all minority interests have been eliminated and all of our subsidiaries are now wholly owned 
our acquisitions have increased our operating revenues and expenses from the date of acquisition 
in the discussion of results below  we quantify the effects of acquisitions on our revenues and expenses 
generally  acquisitions also increased our depreciation and amortization expense as we amortize the value of acquisition intangibles 
however during each of and  we wrote down the value of the intangible assets related to acquisitions significantly and as such  our amortization expense in and respectively  decreased from the prior year 
see the section entitled impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of this write down 
also affecting amortization expense in  was our adoption of sfas no 
on january  which required that we cease amortizing goodwill thus reducing our amortization expense in finally  acquisitions affect non cash compensation when we issue options to employees at the time of an acquisition 
see note m in our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
b investments we have made investments through aether capital  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to promote the development of new technologies that are compatible with the services we offer or that we may wish to integrate into our services 
since august of  we have invested approximately million in companies 
we account for investments in which we exercise significant influence or have an ownership interest greater than percent under the equity method of accounting and record our proportionate share of the investee s net income or loss 
we currently have investments in several publicly traded companies in which we do not exercise significant influence or have an ownership interest greater than percent 
we account for these investments at fair value based on quoted market prices 
net unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from income and recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity unless the decline is deemed to be other than temporary 
subsequent to our investment  the market values of these investments have decreased significantly 
in some cases  we have determined the decline in market value of our investments in publicly traded companies to be other than temporary  and as such have recorded realized losses on these investments  which are included in net loss 
see impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of these charges 
we also currently have investments in several private companies in which we do not exercise significant control 
we account for these investments at cost unless circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable  at which time the carrying value of the investment is adjusted to fair value 
subsequent to our investment  we have written down the carrying value of our investments to fair value  which is approximately million as of december  see impairment charges below for a more detailed discussion of these charges 
c impairment charges i acquisitions sfas no 
impairments 
through december   we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions 
during and  we performed on going analysis of the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles and the value of our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
based on quantitative and qualitative measures  we assessed the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators were present 
based on a variety of indicators  we determined during that the goodwill and other intangibles from our acquisitions may have become impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed undiscounted cash flow analyses of our acquisitions to determine whether any impairments existed 
when the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the related assets  we determined a range of fair values using a combination of valuation methodologies including i 
discounted cash flow analysis  which is based upon converting expected future cash flows to present value  and ii 
changes in market value since the date of acquisition relative to other companies and indices 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to our acquisitions were not fully recoverable 
accordingly  during  we recorded impairment charges of approximately billion  which represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
of the billion  million related to the riverbed acquisition 
goodwill 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in connection with sfas no 
s transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  the statement required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we were required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of january  we were required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit within six months of january  to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
the second step was required for all three reporting units 
in this step  we compared the implied fair value of each reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation was the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of million  which was recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of this charge  million  million and million was in our enterprise mobility solutions  mobile government and transportation segments  respectively 
sfas no 
also requires that we repeat the two step impairment analysis each year  beginning with a recurring annual measurement date chosen by us in we chose september  to be s measurement date  and will continue to perform annual impairment reviews 
the september  review resulted in an additional impairment charge of million  which was recorded as impairment of intangibles and other assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
of this charge  million and million was in our mobile government and transportation segments  respectively 
in both cases above  we  with the assistance of a third party appraiser  arrived at the implied fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow methodology 
due to the continuing macro economic slow down and reduced spending on information technology it in we do not expect dramatic increases in cash flows in the near term which in turn resulted in discounted cash flows that did not support the value of the goodwill that had been in our consolidated balance sheet 
intangibles and other long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale  and broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
during  we assessed the fair value of certain of our long lived assets  including software  computer equipment  other tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
this assessment resulted in an impairment charge of million in  which is recorded in impairment of intangibles and other assets in our consolidated statements of operations 
of this charge  million   and million was in our enterprise mobility solutions  mobile government and transportation segments  respectively 
the remaining impairment charge related to european operations and corporate and other assets 
we  with the assistance of third party appraisers  determined the fair value of these assets based on a combination of quoted market prices and a cost approach methodology 
a portion of the assets referred to above have been reclassified out of property  plant and equipment and are now being classified as assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
ii investments through december   we made investments in other businesses totaling approximately million 
we adjust the carrying value of our available for sale investments and equity method investments in public companies to market and record the change in market value to other comprehensive income 
in accordance with sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  we assess the decline in market value in certain of our public company investments as other than temporary after reviewing the following factors length of time and extent to which the market value of the investment has been below cost  the financial position and the near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the investee for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
with respect to investments in private companies including those we account for using the equity method  we perform on going reviews based on quantitative and qualitative measures 
in evaluating our private company investments  we determined a range of fair values based on a combination of valuation methods where applicable 
we determine fair value from the range of possible values  after considering the strength of the investee s financial position  future prospects and risk profile of the invested company 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the net charge related to net gains losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
during  we recorded a net charge of million  which included million in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the charge related to net gains losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
md a critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating the valuation allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts  estimating the realizable value of our inventory  valuation of long lived intangible assets and goodwill  valuation of investments  and restructuring accruals a revenue recognition we derive our revenue from four sources i subscriber revenue ii engineering services iii software and related services  and iv device sales 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue might have differed materially from that reported 
i 
subscriber revenue we derive subscriber revenue from the provision of real time access to business information integrated into existing wireless communication platforms  and from the provision of comprehensive business solutions designed to meet the mobile management needs of truckload  less than load and private carriers 
for all sales  we obtain signed binding contracts with our subscribers 
contracts with our wireless data subscribers are generally for a one year period and include a termination penalty if cancelled by the subscriber before the one year period expires 
these contracts are generally renewable at the option of the subscriber for additional one year periods or otherwise continue on a monthly basis until cancelled by the subscriber 
contracts with our transportation and logistics subscribers are generally for a three to five year period and include a termination penalty if cancelled by the subscriber before the term of the contract expires 
subscriber revenue is recognized monthly as the service is provided 
activation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer relationship 
ii 
engineering services revenue engineering services revenue is derived from the provision of wireless integration consulting under time and materials and fixed fee contracts 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer 
revenue on fixed fee contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as soon as they become known and estimable 
considerable judgment may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of work to be completed and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some tasks 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to complete the project  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  and our margins on the project in the reporting period  may have differed materially from that reported 
iii 
software and related services revenue software and related services revenues are generated from licensing software and providing services  including maintenance and technical support  training and consulting 
software revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products 
we recognize the revenue when the license agreement is signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  delivery of the software has occurred  and when we estimate that the collectibility of the fees is probable 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment term  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
if we assessed collectibility differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
revenue from licensing software that requires significant customization and modification is recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on the hours incurred in relation to the total estimated hours 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates of the total amount of work we expect to be required to customize or modify the software  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  and our margins on the project in the reporting period  may have differed materially from that reported 
service revenues consist principally of maintenance and technical support  which consists of unspecified when and if available product updates and customer telephone support services and are recognized ratably over the term of the service period 
if we allocated more or less value to these when and if deliverables  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
in situations where we host the software and the customer has the option to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and we believe it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to us to host the software  the software element is accounted for as a seperate element  in accordance with sop otherwise  such amounts are recognized ratably over the hosting period 
if our assessment of this feasibility were different  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
iv 
device revenue we derive device revenue on the sale of wireless devices used to provide our services 
generally  revenue for device sales is recognized upon delivery 
in cases where  in our judgment  the service is essential to the functionality of the device and only our ongoing service is available for the device  we recognize the device revenue as the ongoing service is provided over the shorter of the life of the equipment or the estimated term of the customer relationship 
if management were to judge differently about or above or on the expected term of the customer relationship  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
v 
revenue from multiple element arrangements for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method 
this means that we defer revenue from the total fees associated with the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the element s of the arrangement that has have not yet been delivered 
the fair value of any undelivered elements are established by using historical evidence specific to aether 
for instance  the fair values for maintenance and technical support is based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon the renewal rates quoted in the contracts and the fair value of services  such as training  is based on separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
if we allocated the respective fair values of the elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition may have differed materially from that reported 
vi 
revenue from related parties revenue from products and services sold to companies that we have also made strategic investments in related parties is allocated between the investment and revenue recognized based on the relative fair value of the products and services sold and the investment received 
we have determined the fair value of the investments based on the fact that all of our investments were made in participation with other unrelated financial investors at the same price per share as the other investors 
our investment policy generally limits our investments to companies that have completed at least two rounds of financing and generally requires that an unrelated investor lead the round of financing that we participate in 
we have estimated the fair value of products and services sold based on comparable sales transactions to other unrelated companies 
sales to related parties were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
if we estimated fair values of the products and services differently  the amount of revenue recognized may have differed materially from that reported 
please refer to the section below entitled other related party information for more information on related parties 
b allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential product returns and the valuation of our accounts receivable 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
we recorded provisions for sales returns of million and  during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as a result  we recorded bad debt expense of million and million during the year s ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our net accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts of  million 
if we had used different estimates and assumptions related to the amount of sales returns we would receive  and about the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our provisions for sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts may have differed materially from that reported 
c valuation of inventory inventory  net of allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory  consists of finished goods such as handheld computers  pagers  wireless modems  and accessories and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard costing method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
our inventory is subject to rapid technological changes that could have an adverse impact on its realization in future periods 
in addition  there are a limited number of suppliers of our inventory 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million and  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of our inventory due to obsolescence and excess inventory 
we estimated the reduction in inventory value based on our consideration of the following quantities and composition of inventory held  sales prices of competing vendors  projected unit sales and unit pricing over subsequent twelve month period  and evaluation of remaining inventory purchase commitments 
if our projections were different  our margins on device sales may have differed materially from that reported 
if our estimates of projected units sales and unit pricing are less than actual results  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future 
d valuation of long lived assets including intangible assets and goodwill during  we recorded significant impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions 
these charges and our accounting policies are described in detail under impairment charges above 
in  we recorded significant impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets including our annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see impairment charges above for further discussion 
e valuation of investments during and  we recorded significant impairment charges on our strategic investments 
these charges and our accounting policies are described under impairment charges above 
f estimation of restructuring accruals during  we implemented an expense reduction plan as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the consolidation of excess facilities and a reduction in our work force 
the charge related mainly to a workforce reduction of over positions and the closing or consolidation of twelve facilities 
during  we continued our expense reduction plan focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures intended to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in further consolidation of excess facilities and eliminations of positions 
the charge related mainly to a work force reduction of over positions and the closing or consolidation of four facilities 
employee separation benefits under the restructuring plans include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs and other costs included expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
as of december   the accrued liability related to the restructuring was million 
calculation of the restructuring accrual related to expected losses on subleases requires us to make estimates concerning the expected length of time to sublease the facility  the expected rental rates on subleases  and estimated brokerage expenses associated with executing the sublease 
we used the assistance of independent real estate brokerage firms in the making these estimates  and our estimates may be impacted by future economic trends 
the expected losses on subleases have not been discounted 
if the actual results differ from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring accrual related to expected losses on subleases  including recording additional losses 
md a recent accounting pronouncements i sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds fasb no 
and in relation to reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
and and requires gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in opinion applying the provisions of opinion will differentiate between normal recurring operations of a company and transactions that are unusual or infrequent in matter 
sfas no 
also amends statement no 
 to the effect that sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications should be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
in connection with the adoption of this statement  we will be required to classify as operating income gains from the extinguishment of debt of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
such amounts are currently recorded as extraordinary items 
ii sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when incurred at fair value 
sfas no 
in turn eliminates the definition and requirements of etif issue sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
may have an effect on the timing of future restructuring charges taken  if and when they occur 
iii sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
the statement is effective for sfas no 
requires new disclosures about the effect of stock based employee compensation on reported results 
the statement requires that effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form  content and location of those disclosures 
the statement permits several ways of transitioning to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  however the statement does not require that companies discontinue the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we will continue to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation and have adopted the disclosure requirements of statement in this annual report filed on form k 
see footnote in our consolidated financial statements 
iv financial interpretation no 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation no 
discusses the necessary disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires the guarantor to recognize as a liability  at fair value  at the inception of the guarantee  the obligation incurred in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements are effective for the reporting requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued after december  please see section entitled liquidity and capital resources below for a description of these guarantees 
v eitf in november  the emerging issues task force issued its final consensus on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  or alternatively  entities may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
eitf discusses criteria necessary to determine when an arrangement may be viewed to have separate units of accounting and thus revenue and when an arrangement should be viewed as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently performing an analysis of how this might affect revenue recognition for arrangements we routinely enter into that have multiple deliverables 
vi financial interpretation no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entites created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the end of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
md a comparison of results for years ended december   and a subscriber revenue subscriber revenue consists of the amortization over the life of the expected customer relationship of nonrefundable activation fees  monthly per subscriber service fees  monthly per subscriber exchange fees for access to financial information from the securities exchanges and markets  and monthly fees for providing access to our network operations center 
subscriber revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  subscribers increased to  at december  from  at december  and from  at december  approximately million of the increase in revenue and  of the increase in subscribers in was due to increased subscribers for the highway master product line obtained in connection with an acquisition made in the first quarter of the remaining increase was primarily due to the increase in subscribers for our blackberry by aether products  partially offset by a decline in subscriber revenue from our domestic and european market data products 
approximately million of the increase in over was due to sales to existing and new mobilemax customers and  approximately million of the increase in subscriber revenue resulted from the increased number of subscribers that signed on to our existing and new product and service offerings such as wireless messaging and financial services products 
the mobilemax product line was obtained in connection with an acquisition made in the fourth quarter of b cost of subscriber revenue cost of subscriber revenue consists primarily of airtime costs  financial data costs  and securities exchange and market fees 
our airtime costs are determined by agreements we have with several wireless carriers 
typically  we have one year contracts to buy data network capacity either for an agreed amount of kilobytes at a flat fee or on a cents per kilobyte basis 
cost of subscriber revenue excludes depreciation on  and operating costs of  our network operations center and certain costs of customer fulfillment and customer care 
cost of subscriber revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the increase for was primarily due to the increase in subscriber revenue over as discussed above 
approximately million of the increase in was due to increased subscribers for the highway master product line obtained in connection with an acquisition made in the first quarter of we generally expect the cost of subscriber revenue to increase proportionately with any increase in subscriber revenue 
the increase for from relates primarily to the increase in subscriber revenue between periods as discussed above 
during  the cost of subscriber revenue increased relative to volume of sales as a result of several factors 
these factors included the increased cost of airtime in germany related to sila and incremental costs associated with providing services to non paying customers obtained in connection with our acquisition of motient s retail transportation business unit 
during we converted some of these non paying customers into paying subscribers by repairing their non working equipment 
due to these conversion and to the cessation of our operations in germany  our margins improved in c engineering services revenue revenue from engineering services consists of amounts billed to our customers for engineering time on an hourly basis or fixed fees on a per project basis 
engineering services revenue decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  the decrease for over was primarily due to the general decrease in corporate it information technology spending which in turn has reduced spending on the custom solutions that our engineering group provides 
the decrease in over was due to the completion of several large engineering projects in early combined with a general decrease in corporate it information technology spending 
d cost of engineering services revenue cost of engineering services revenue consists of cash compensation and related costs for engineers and other project related costs 
cost of engineering services revenue decreased to million for the year december   from million for the year ended december   and from million for the year ended december  the decrease between periods was primarily due to the decrease in engineering services performed as discussed above  combined with lower relative costs of revenue as we gain engineering efficiencies 
e software and related services revenue we derive revenue from the licensing of software products such as our packetcluster  pocketblue and firerms software suites most often used by our federal  state and local government customers 
we also derive revenue from the licensing of other software products including elements of the aether fusion tm platform  formerly sold as aim and the scoutware software suite  as well as from the e mobile software suite 
in the future  we may generate revenue from the licensing of newer versions of our software foundation aether fusion tm 
software and related services revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which increased from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the decrease between and was due to the decrease in software sales for the scoutware software suite  and approximately million of the decrease was due to the decrease in software sales for the packetcluster software suites 
the decrease in scoutware sales was primarily related to the loss of several high volume customers from to most of the remaining decrease was due to the elimination of the advantage software suite 
the decreased sales of these products reflects the general decrease in corporate it spending during and into the increase in over was primarily due to sales to existing and new customers of the packetcluster software suite and the firerms software suite  both of which were obtained in conjunction with acquisitions made late in f cost of software and related services revenue cost of software and related services revenue consists of costs of licensing  including royalty payments and personnel costs 
cost of software and related services revenue was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   relating to royalty fees for third party intellectual property used in the software that we sell and personnel costs incurred in the customization of software products and the support of those products 
the decrease for from relates primarily to the decrease in software revenue between periods as discussed above 
the increase for over relates primarily to the increase in software revenue between periods as discussed above 
g device sales we derive device revenue on the sale of wireless devices used to provide our services 
revenue from device sales decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in device sales between and relates to decreased device revenue from some of our government contracts as these projects have moved from the hardware deployment phase in to the latter stages of completion in the decrease in device sales also relates to the reduction in the selling price of handheld devices  partially offset by the increase in device sales of the mobile messaging product line 
the increase in device sales between and relates primarily to sales of products to new subscribers between periods and million of bulk sales of devices to other vendors 
h cost of device sales cost of device sales consists of the cost of the hardware from the hardware manufacturer or wholesaler 
cost of devices decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was an increase from million for the year ended december  approximately  and million of the cost of device sales for and  respectively  related to obsolescence and excess inventory charges 
the decrease in cost of device sales in also relates to the movement of some of the government contracts into different stages of completion as mentioned above in device sales 
the increase in the cost of device sales for relates primarily to the increase in device sales between periods and the bulk sales of devices to other vendors 
included in the results for are bulk sales of hardware at or below cost made primarily to reduce inventory 
i research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and related costs for engineers engaged in research and development activities and  to a lesser extent  costs of materials relating to these activities 
we expense research and development costs as we incur them 
research and development expenses  including in process research and development related to acquisitions  decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in from was primarily due to our reduction in work force between periods and from significantly reduced spending on contractors and facilities 
the increase in from was due to the hiring of additional engineers and consultants for increased research and development activities associated with the development of our software products  mobile computing platforms  including aetherfusion tm  and wireless data services and a full year of costs associated with engineers obtained in connection with acquisitions made during in addition  we incurred charges of million for in process research and development in connection with several of our acquisitions in we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to decrease in due to reductions in personnel that have occurred during for more information on our restructuring efforts refer to the section entitled estimation of restructuring accrual above 
j general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of cash compensation and related costs for general corporate and business development personnel  along with rent  network operations costs  and general support costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to was primarily due to reductions in personnel and the reduced spending on professional fees 
the increase in was primarily due to additional personnel and consultants performing general corporate activities  additional facilities and the full year of operations of our acquisitions since in  the increased scope of our business required additional personnel and other expenses  such as consulting  travel and facilities  in all areas including customer service  network operations  project management  legal and accounting 
we will incur general administrative expenses in related to our outsourcing agreement with eds  however these expenses will be offset by a reduction in personnel and other cost of providing these same services internally 
as such  we do not anticipate significant changes in our general and administrative expenses in for more information on our restructuring efforts refer to the section entitled estimation of restructuring accrual above 
k selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotions  sales and marketing personnel  travel and entertainment  certain customer fulfillment and customer care costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in selling and marketing expenses in compared to was due primarily to reductions in personnel  bad debt expense  and advertising 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in over was due primarily to the increased number of sales persons obtained in connection with acquisitions and the related salaries  commissions  and other costs incurred as a result of increased revenue for we anticipate that our selling and marketing expenses will continue to decrease in due to a full year s benefit of the personnel reductions made in and continued focus on efficient spending of our selling and marketing dollars 
l depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of the amortization of intangible assets obtained in connection with our acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expenses also include depreciation expenses arising from equipment purchased for our data centers and other property and equipment purchases 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the impairment charges recorded during and  which significantly reduced the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles  and from the adoption of sfas no 
on january   requiring us to cease amortizing approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
for more information on our adoption of sfas no 
 please refer to the section entitled new accounting pronouncements above 
given the reduction of the net book value of our assets as a result of impairment charges taken during the year  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in the short term 
m option and warrant expense option and warrant expense consists of expenses recorded to account for the difference  on the date of grant  between the fair market value of common stock and the exercise price of stock options issued to employees  the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees and the fair value of equity based awards to non employees 
we have in the past issued options and or warrants at prices below market value in connection with our acquisitions as replacements for existing options in the acquired company 
we account for equity based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including fin  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is based upon the difference  if any  on the date of grant  between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price 
all equity based awards to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
option and warrant expense decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  which was a increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of the cancellation of options as we reduced our work force 
the increase for was primarily due to the fact that in january  we canceled approximately million options granted to employees and issued approximately  shares of restricted stock to a number of employees holding options with exercise prices higher than our then current market value 
we recognize option and warrant expense as these shares vest 
we expect to record an additional million of expense over the vesting period of the restricted stock grants through during and  we recorded expense of million and million  respectively  related to these restricted shares 
this increase was partially offset by some restricted shares expiring as employees were terminated throughout the year pursuant to our cost containment efforts 
given our numerous acquisitions since our inception and the issuance of restricted stock under our acquisition incentive plan  we expect to continue to have substantial option and warrant expense 
n impairment of intangibles and other assets impairment of intangibles and other assets consists of the amount of goodwill  intangibles and other assets written down in the period 
impairment of intangibles decreased to million in from billion in see factors affecting comparability above for further discussion of the impairment of intangibles and other assets in and there was no impairment of intangibles for o restructuring charge during each of the last three quarters of  we had restructuring charges 
we implemented an expense reduction plan as part of our integration strategy focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures intended to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the consolidation of excess facilities and a reduction in our workforce 
the charge related mainly to a workforce reduction of over positions and the closing or consolidation of twelve facilities 
employee separation benefits under the restructuring plan included severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure costs included expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  contract termination costs and other costs 
during  we continued our expense reduction plan focused on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
these efforts have resulted in the further consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of positions 
as a result of this restructuring plan  we recorded charges to earnings of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  there was no restructuring charge for the charges related mainly to a workforce reduction of over and positions and the closing or consolidation of four and twelve facilities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
employee separation benefits of approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  include severance  medical  and other benefits 
facility closure and other costs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  include expected losses on subleases  brokerage commissions  asset impairment charges  and other costs 
as of december   the accrued liability balance related to the restructuring was million 
p interest income interest income consists primarily of interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  which was a decrease from million for the year ended december  the decreases in and were primarily the result of decreasing cash balances over the years combined with decreased interest rates 
we expect interest income to continue to decline as our cash balance declines 
q interest expense interest expense consists primarily of debt service on our outstanding convertible subordinated notes payable 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease for as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as the result of the buy back of debt in during  we bought back million face value of our convertible subordinated notes payable  most of which was repurchased at the end of the second and fourth quarters  and as such expect reduced interest expense going forward 
the increase for was primarily due to a full year of interest on our notes in and accrued interest on a million forward sale arrangement entered into during r equity in losses of investments equity in losses of investments consists of our proportionate share of the net losses in our investments over which we exercise significant influence and as such account for under the equity method of accounting 
equity in losses of investments decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  which was an increase from million for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to relates to continued write downs of certain of our investments coupled with a reduction of losses within the investees as they intentionally reduce spending or are short on capital to spend 
the increase in over relates to a full year of losses associated with investments made at various times during s investment loss  including impairments  net investment loss  including impairments consists of the loss taken on investments where the decline in market value was deemed to be other than temporary 
investment loss also includes amounts related to the decline in the fair value of derivative instruments  offset by realized gains from the sales of investments 
net investment loss  including impairments decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in december   which included million and million  respectively  in impairment charges related to our investments 
the remainder of the net charge related to net gains losses from the sales of investments  and changes in the fair value of warrants 
we had no investment losses in the decrease in was due to the fact that the carrying value of our investments had been substantially depleted by the losses taken on our investments in the increase in was mainly due to overall declining market conditions 
t minority interest minority interest consists wholly of reuters ownership interest in sila prior to during the fourth quarter of  we purchased from reuters their interest in sila 
reuters portion of sila s loss was approximately  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
since we now wholly own sila  we will no longer allocate any portion of sila s net income or loss to reuters through minority interests and all of our subsidiaries are now wholly owned 
sila s losses are included in the consolidated income statement for the years ended december   and sila s decreased losses in were due to our integration strategy focusing on improving operational efficiencies and the implementation of other measures in order to reduce planned expenses 
the increased losses in over were due to a full year of operations combined with a ramp up of spending as sila expanded 
u other income other income was million for the year ended december  there was no other income for the years ended december  and other income in consisted of an escrow settlement of million related to our purchase of rts wireless in november of  offset by other expenses related to the settlement

the income tax benefit of million and million for and  respectively  consists of a foreign deferred tax benefit associated with the impairment of identifiable intangibles by sila 
we do not expect to record additional tax benefits for the foreseeable future

extraordinary item was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the extraordinary item related to the early extinguishment of million in convertible subordinated notes payable 
there were no extraordinary items in x cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the charge related to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the million impairment charge represented a decrease in the value of certain intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions made in as discussed in the section entitled impairment charges above 
the amount related to the adoption of sfas no  accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
the million represented the fair value of warrants we hold in two of our investees  which met the criteria for a derivative under sfas no 
there was no cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in md a segment results aether s operating segments include enterprise mobility solutions  transportation  and mobile government

aether began to report its financial results by segment as of the first quarter of during  and  aether s reportable segments have changed and aether expects them to continue to change as its operating structure  business and the market in which it operates evolves 
as we did not report based on our current segments for  it is impracticable for us to compare s results to the results of segment detail is summarized as follows year ended december  enterprise mobilility solutions transportation mobile government corporate other total revenue gross profit loss total assets md a other related party information a aol we entered into a series of agreements the agreements with america online  inc aol in november of on november   the company  aol and aol time warner inc aoltw and  collectively with aol  the aol parties entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release the settlement agreement pursuant to which aether and the aol parties agreed to terminate all of the agreements with the exception of a stock purchase agreement 
the stock purchase agreement filed by aether on april  as exhibit to form k will remain in effect to govern the  shares of our stock purchased by aol on december  but was modified by the settlement agreement so as not to require future investment in aether by aol 
in connection with the termination of the other agreements  the settlement agreement also provides for the release to us of approximately million that we had previously deposited in an escrow account under the terms of the agreements 
subsequent to signing the settlement agreement  million was released and is no longer shown as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
the parties have agreed that no other amounts are due or owing to any party 
pursuant to this settlement  we took a charge of approximately million to write off certain aol related intangible assets 
b additional related party information during the years   and  the company received services from stockholders and other related entities including reuters financial data services  huber oros benefit coordination services and aol time warner advertising services 
these companies are considered related parties due to the fact that they are significant stockholders or entities with familial relationships with members of the senior management of the company or with significant shareholders of the company 
for the year ended december   related party expense was million  the majority of which related to advertising services purchased 
for the years ended december  and  related party expenses were million and million respectively 
please refer to the section above entitled critical accounting policies for more information on related party revenue 
md a liquidity and capital resources since  we have financed our operations primarily through private and public placements of our equity and debt securities 
through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately billion  net of underwriters discounts  including the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments and working capital of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal use of cash in each of these periods was to fund our losses from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we used million for the purchase of property and equipment  million for investments in companies and million for payments on acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we used million for the purchase of property and equipment  million for acquisition related costs  and million for the net purchases of short term investment instruments primarily united states government sponsored securities 
net cash provided by financing activities was billion and million for the years ended december  and respectively and net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities related primarily to the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes payable 
for the year ended december   we used million to repurchase convertible subordinated notes 
even given our recent repurchase of debt  we believe we have sufficient resources to cover our operating expenses and material commitments for at least the next months 
a letters of credit during the normal course of operations  we have entered into various letter of credit agreements 
as of december   we had outstanding million in letters of credit which expire at various times over the next eight years 
b guarantees we have certain guarantees disclosable under fin as follows we have guaranteed the payment to our landlord on several properties we have sublet 
the maximum guarantee on these properties is million 
in our mobile government segment  we may have to pay liquidated damages in some cases if our subcontractors do not perform on time 
in addition  we sometimes indemnify certain of our customers against damages  if any  they might incur as a result of a claim brought against them related to third party software imbedded in our products 
we are unable to estimate the maximum exposure of such indemnifications due to the inherent uncertainty and the varying nature of contractual terms 
we generally warrant our products against certain manufacturing and other defects 
these product warranties are provided for specific periods of time and or usage of the product depending on the nature of the product and other factors 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and approximately  respectively  for estimated product warranty claims 
the accrued product warranty costs are based primarily on historical experience of actual warranty claims as well as current information on repair cost 
the following table provides the changes in our product warranties warranty liability balance at january  liabilities accrued for warranties issued during the period warranty claims paid during the period changes in liability for warranties during the period  including expirations warranty liability balance at december  c contractual obligations the following table describes all of our contractual commitments including our future minimum lease payments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total long term debt obligations includes interest of approximately million through march facilities representing million of our minimum lease payments have been subleased or are available for sublease 
although there can be no assurance  we expect actual expenditures related to the above commitments will be less than indicated above due to reductions we are in the process of negotiating 
the company does not have any other long term liabilities requiring cash payment deferred rent and deferred revenue do not require a cash outlay that are not already included in the categories above 
for instance  the entire long term portion of our restructuring reserve relates to our operating lease obligations which are already quantified in the third line of the above table 
our commitments to eds include fees for year one and implementation fees 
contractual commitments for years through are not included here as they will be determined based on variable pricing and are cancelable for fees ranging from approximately million to million over the term of the arrangement md a risk factors our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including those described below 
a we have historically incurred losses and we expect these losses to continue in the future 
we reported net losses of million  billion and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  systems development and administrative expenses 
therefore  we will need to generate significant revenue to become profitable and sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
in particular  there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability before our cash resources have been depleted 
b there is no established market for our services  we may not be able to sell enough of our services to become profitable 
the markets for wireless data and transaction services are still emerging 
continued growth in demand for  and acceptance of  these services remains uncertain 
current barriers to market acceptance of these services include cost  reliability  functionality and ease of use 
we cannot be certain that these barriers will be overcome 
our competitors may develop alternative wireless data communications systems that gain broader market acceptance than our systems 
if the market for our services does not grow  or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate  we may not be able to attract customers for our services and our revenues would be adversely affected 
c our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances may not deliver the value we paid or will pay for them 
excessive expenses may result if we do not successfully integrate our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances  or if the costs and management resources we expend in connection with the integrations exceed our expectations 
we expect that our acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances and any acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances we may pursue in the future will have a continuing  significant impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the value of the companies that we acquired or invested in may be less than the amount we paid  and our financial results may be adversely affected if we fail to assimilate the acquired assets with our pre existing business  we lose key employees of these companies or of aether as a result of the acquisitions  our management s attention is diverted by other business concerns  or we assume unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets 
in addition  the companies we have acquired or invested in or may acquire or invest in are subject to each of the business risks we describe in this section  and if they incur any of these risks the businesses may not be as valuable as the amount we paid 
further  we cannot guarantee that we will realize the benefits or strategic objectives we were seeking to obtain by acquiring or investing in these companies 
we have already reduced the carrying value of our acquired companies and investments in other companies by an aggregate of billion due to our evaluation of the fair value of those businesses  and we cannot assure you that additional reductions will not be necessary 
d we may not achieve profitability if we are unable to maintain  improve and develop the wireless data services we offer 
we believe that our future business prospects depend in part on our ability to maintain and improve our current services and to develop new ones on a timely basis 
our services will have to achieve market acceptance  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our service offerings  major new wireless data services and service enhancements require long development and testing periods 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new services and service enhancements 
additionally  our new services and service enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
if we cannot effectively develop and improve services  we may not be able to recover our fixed costs or otherwise become profitable 
e if we do not respond effectively and on a timely basis to rapid technological change  our services may become obsolete and we may lose sales 
the wireless and data communications industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  industry standards  customer needs and competition  as well as by frequent new product and service introductions 
our services are integrated with wireless handheld devices and the computer systems of our corporate customers 
our services must also be compatible with the data networks of wireless carriers 
we must respond to technological changes affecting both our customers and suppliers 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new services that respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accomplish all of the following in a timely and cost effective manner effectively use and integrate new wireless and data technologies  continue to develop our technical expertise  enhance our wireless data  engineering and system design services  develop applications for new wireless networks  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other changes 
f we depend upon wireless networks owned and controlled by others 
if we do not have continued access to sufficient capacity on reliable networks  we may be unable to deliver services and our sales could decrease 
our ability to grow and achieve profitability partly depends on our ability to buy sufficient capacity on the networks of wireless carriers such as verizon wireless  cingular  metrocall  motient and at t wireless and on the reliability and security of their systems 
all of our services are delivered using airtime purchased from third parties 
we depend on these companies to provide uninterrupted and bug free service and would not be able to satisfy our customers needs if they failed to provide the required capacity or needed level of service 
in addition  our expenses would increase and our profitability could be materially adversely affected if wireless carriers were to increase the prices of their services 
our existing agreements with the wireless carriers generally have one year terms 
some of these wireless carriers are  or could become  our competitors  and if they compete with us  they may refuse to provide us with their services 
g one of our suppliers of wireless services has been sued for patent infringment which raises uncertainty regarding its ability to continue to supply us with these services 
research in motion limited rim which supplies us with hardware and wireless services that we in turn package with other services and resell  is engaged in legal proceedings with ntp inc which alleges that certain rim products infringed on patents held by ntp inc 
this creates uncertainty regarding rim s ability to continue to supply us with services 
rim s inability to supply services to us could cause a loss of revenue and increase our net losses 
h our failure to develop recognition for the aether brand could prevent us from achieving a profitable level of sales 
our expenses related to sales and marketing activities excluding option and warrant expense were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
however  in connection with our efforts to reduce operating expenses  we began to reduce our sales and marketing expenses in and intend to reduce those expenses significantly in although we believe we can effectively market aether s brand with reduced costs  our efforts may be less successful than if our expenses remained at historic levels 
there can be no assurances that holders of other trademarks will not claim that the published or allowed trademarks  or other aether pending trademark applications  infringe their trademarks 
we may not be able to use these names effectively or at all if we fail to obtain such registrations due to conflicting marks or otherwise 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we expect to market our acquired products and services under their existing brands 
we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers if these brands are not well received by our customers  if our marketing efforts are not productive  if we are otherwise unsuccessful in increasing our brand awareness or if our competition has greater brand recognition 
i as we implement our plan to reduce our operating expenses  we may fail to support our operations  which could reduce demand for our services and materially adversely affect our revenue 
our business strategy is based on the assumption that the number of subscribers to our services  the amount of information they want to receive and the number of services we offer will all increase 
we must continue to develop and expand our systems and operations to accommodate this growth 
the expansion and or maintenance and adaptation of our customer service and network operations center require substantial financial  operational and management resources 
at the same time  we have implemented plans to reduce our operating expenses  which entail a reduction in operational and management resources 
while we believe that our cost reductions are targeted at areas that are not necessary to maintain and develop our ability to serve customers  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in lowering costs while maintaining our ability to provide service 
if we fail to maintain or improve service levels  we may lose customers and or the opportunity to provide more services and products 
j we depend on recruiting and retaining key management and technical personnel with wireless data and software experience 
we may not be able to develop new products or support existing products if we cannot hire or retain qualified employees 
because of the technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete  our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees 
competition for qualified personnel in the wireless data and software industries is intense and finding qualified personnel with experience in both industries is even more difficult 
we believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills in the field of wireless data communication  and it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire and retain these persons 
competitors and others have in the past attempted  and may in the future attempt  to recruit our employees 
each of our engineers has entered into a non competition agreement with us for a period of ten months after they leave aether 
these agreements will not prevent our engineers from leaving or working for competitors relatively soon after they leave us 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy for david s 
oros  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we do not maintain insurance policies for any of our other executive officers 
k we may not have adequately protected our intellectual property rights  which could allow competitors to develop similar products using similar technology  thus reducing our sales and revenue 
we have attempted to protect our technology  including the technology we have obtained or will obtain in our acquisitions  through patent  trademark and copyright protection  as well as through trade secret laws and non competition and non disclosure agreements with all employees 
our technology may infringe on valid patents held by third parties  or patents held by third parties may limit the scope of any patents we receive 
in particular  the patent we acquired in our acquisition of riverbed covers a technology that is similar to other patented technologies 
if we are not adequately protected  other companies with sufficient engineering expertise could develop competing products based on our intellectual property and reduce our sales and revenue 
l we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights and incur costs of defense and possibly royalties or lose the right to use technology important to providing our services 
the telecommunications and software industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
as the number of participants in our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us could increase 
intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle  could require us to enter into costly royalty arrangements  could divert management attention from administering our business and could hinder us from conducting our business 
m we may be subject to liability for transmitting information  and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from this liability 
we may be subject to claims relating to information transmitted over systems we develop or operate 
these claims could take the form of lawsuits for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement or other actions based on the nature and content of the materials 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
n disruption of our services due to accidental or intentional security breaches may harm our reputation  potentially causing a loss of sales and an increase in our expenses 
a significant barrier to the growth of wireless data services or transactions on the internet or by other electronic means has been the need for secure transmission of confidential information 
our systems could be disrupted by unauthorized access  computer viruses and other accidental or intentional actions 
we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
if a third party were able to misappropriate our users personal or proprietary information or credit card information  we could be subject to claims  litigation or other potential liabilities that could materially adversely impact our revenue and may result in the loss of customers 
o any type of systems failure could reduce sales  increase costs or result in claims of liability 
certain of our existing wireless data services are dependent on real time  continuous feeds from reuters selectfeed plus and others 
the ability of our subscribers to make securities trades  receive sales leads and receive critical business information requires timely and uninterrupted connections with our wireless network carriers 
any disruption from our satellite feeds or backup landline feeds could result in delays in our subscribers ability to receive information or execute trades 
we cannot be sure that our systems will operate appropriately if we experience a hardware or software failure or if there is an earthquake  fire or other natural disaster  a power or telecommunications failure  intentional disruptions of service by third parties  an act of god or an act of war 
a failure in our systems could cause delays in transmitting data  and as a result we may lose customers or face litigation that could involve material costs and distract management from operating our business 
p our ability to sell new and existing services at a profit could be impaired by competitors 
intense competition could develop in the market for services we offer 
we developed our software using standard industry development tools 
many of our agreements with wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers and data providers are non exclusive 
our competitors could develop and use the same products and services in competition with us 
with time and capital  it would be possible for competitors to replicate our services 
our potential competitors could include wireless network carriers such as at t wireless  cingular wireless  nextel communications  inc  sprint pcs group  and verizon wireless  mobile and or wireless software companies including brience  inc  comverse technology  inc  extended systems  inc  everypath  inc  openwave systems  and puma technology  inc  wireless data services providers such as solutions inc and goamerica  inc and  wireless systems integrators and database vendors  including ibm and oracle 
many of our potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do 
furthermore  competitors may develop a different approach to marketing the services we provide in which subscribers may not be required to pay for the information provided by our services 
competition could reduce our market share or force us to lower prices to unprofitable levels 
q an interruption in the supply of products and services that we obtain from third parties could cause a decline in sales of our services  and products we purchase to avoid shortages may become obsolete before we can use them 
in designing  developing and supporting our wireless data services  we rely on wireless carriers  wireless handheld device manufacturers  content providers  software providers and companies that manage some of our other services such as our internal it operations and customer care services 
these suppliers may experience difficulty in supplying us products or services sufficient to meet our needs or they may terminate or fail to renew contracts for supplying us these products or services on terms we find acceptable 
any significant interruption in the supply of any of these products or services could cause a decline in sales of our services unless and until we are able to replace the functionality provided by these products and services 
we also depend on third parties to deliver and support reliable products  enhance our current products  develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
in addition  we rely on the ability of our content providers including reuters  the new york stock exchange  inc  the chicago board of trade  the nasdaq stock market  inc 
and the options price reporting authority to continue to provide us with uninterrupted access to the news and financial information we provide to our customers 
the failure of third parties to meet these criteria  or their refusal or failure to deliver the information for whatever reason  could materially harm our business 
r our sales cycle is long  and our stock price could decline if sales are delayed or cancelled 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating performance are exacerbated by the length of time between our first contact with a business customer and the first revenue from sales of services to that customer or end users 
because our services represent a significant investment for our business customers  we spend a substantial amount of time educating them regarding the use and benefits of our services and they  in turn  spend a substantial amount of time performing internal reviews and obtaining capital expenditure approvals before purchasing our services 
as much as a year may elapse between the time we approach a business customer and the time we begin to deliver services to a customer or end user 
any delay in sales of our services could cause our quarterly operating results to vary significantly from projected results  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  we may spend a significant amount of time and money on a potential customer that ultimately does not purchase our services 
s our software may contain defects or errors  and our sales could decrease if this injures our reputation or delays shipments of our software 
our software products and platforms are complex and must meet the stringent technical requirements of our customers 
we must develop our services quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing software and telecommunications markets 
software as complex as ours is likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
our software may not be free from errors or defects after delivery to customers has begun  which could result in the rejection of our software or services  damage to our reputation  lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased service and warranty costs 
t new laws and regulations that impact our industry could increase our costs or reduce our opportunities to earn revenue 
we are not currently subject to direct regulation by the federal communications commission or any other governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to publicly traded delaware corporations of similar size that are headquartered in maryland 
however  in the future  we may become subject to regulation by the fcc or another regulatory agency 
in addition  the wireless carriers that supply us airtime and certain of our hardware suppliers are subject to regulation by the fcc and regulations that affect them could increase our costs or reduce our ability to continue selling and supporting our services 
u we conduct operations in a number of countries through sila and are subject to risks of international operations 
we currently operate outside the us through sila  which has operations throughout europe 
any failure by sila to successfully implement or maintain services could result in negative publicity and have an unfavorable impact on our ability to expand our products and services to europe 
we face various risks in expanding outside the us  including difficulty and cost of monitoring our international operations  cultural differences in the conduct of business  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including us export restrictions on encryption technologies  and recessionary or inflationary environments in foreign economies  particularly in the financial services sector 
we cannot ensure that our international operations will contribute positively to our business  financial condition or result of operations 
our failure to manage international growth could result in higher operating costs than anticipated or could delay or preclude altogether our ability to generate revenues in international markets 
in addition  our expanding operations outside the us are  in some instances  conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could cause currency exchange losses 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
v debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
as a result of the million of convertible subordinated notes due currently outstanding  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  primarily consisting of the notes 
as a result of this indebtedness  we are obligated to make principal and interest payments 
there is a possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing arrangements will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
w we may not be able to recover the full value of goodwill recorded on some of our acquisitions and investments 
during   and  we recorded approximately billion in goodwill and other intangibles related to our acquisitions and made investments in other companies of approximately million 
consideration for some of our acquisitions was partially or fully funded through the issuance of shares of our common stock at a time when our stock price was at historically high prices 
most of the companies we acquired or invested in were start up or newly formed entities 
most of these companies were privately held and their fair values are highly subjective and not readily determinable 
our policy is to review the value of all our acquisitions and investments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
at the time of our acquisitions and investments  market valuations and the availability of capital for such companies were at historically high levels 
during the year ended december   stock prices and market valuations in our industry and similar industries have fallen substantially in response to a variety of factors  including a general downturn in the economy  a curtailment in the availability of capital and a general reduction in technology expenditures 
the market valuations of those publicly traded companies in which we have invested and of other companies similar to those we have acquired or invested in have declined substantially 
for the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges aggregating million on these acquisitions and investments 
if similar adverse market conditions develop in the future  we may be required to take additional impairment charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term low risk instruments 
all investments in securities with maturities greater than one year are held as available for sale  in compliance with our investment policy 
at december   we had million including restricted cash invested in money market  commercial paper and certificates of deposit 
at december   we had million invested in us government agency sponsored securities with maturities that range from less than one year to three years 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate subordinated convertible notes payable 
the fair value of this fixed rate debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
if market rates decline  the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policy  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our risk of interest rate fluctuations 
as our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates  we have minimal cash flow exposure due to general interest rate changes associated with our long term debt obligations 
foreign rate sensitivity we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our european subsidiary  sila 
all sales from the us to foreign countries have been denominated in us dollars 
since the revenue and expenses of sila generally are denominated in local currencies  exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the us dollar will subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of sila as well as risks sometimes associated with international operations 
the countries in which sila has operations have traditionally had relatively stable currencies 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure 
we believe that a increase or decline in the british pound exchange ratio would not be material to cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income  or cash flows from consolidated operations
