restatement deloitte and touche llp  which we refer to in this report as deloitte  the company s independent auditor  in connection with its audit of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year  identified equipment sales transactions for which revenue had been recognized in the fourth quarter of  which deloitte believed should have been recognized in other periods 
deloitte brought these issues to the attention of management 
management immediately notified the audit committee of the board of directors 
in response  the audit committee  which is comprised entirely of independent directors  immediately commenced an investigation into our equipment revenue recognition policies generally  and specifically with regard to the equipment sales transactions identified by deloitte  and other related or similar transactions 
to assist it in this investigation  the audit committee retained morgan lewis bockius  llp  which we refer to in this report as morgan lewis  as independent counsel  and morgan lewis retained the accounting firm of bdo seidman  llp  which we refer to in this report as bdo  to provide forensic accounting services in support of its work 
the investigation included a review of significant equipment sales transactions of the company during the period from october  through december   to assess the revenue recognition policies applied to these transactions  whether these equipment sales transactions were departures from our stated revenue recognition policy and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the reasons for any departures 
as a result of the investigation by the audit committee  we have restated our previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and the restatement arose from the adjustments of certain income statement items which principally relate to the treatment and timing of revenue recognition of a small percentage of total equipment sales transactions 
the effect of the adjustments for the year ended december  is to decrease the company s previously reported fiscal consolidated revenues from million to million  increase net loss from million to million and increase diluted loss per share from to 
for the year ended december   the effect of these adjustments is to decrease the company s previously reported fiscal consolidated revenues from million to million  decrease net income from million to million and decrease diluted income per share from to 
at the direction of the audit committee  the company is implementing changes to its financial organization and enhancing its internal controls in response to issues identified in the investigation and otherwise raised by the restatement 
these changes are more fully discussed in item of this report 
unless otherwise expressly stated  all financial information in this report is presented inclusive of these income statement changes and other adjustments 
the reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the amounts currently being reported is presented in note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market worldwide solid imaging systems designed to reduce the time it takes to produce three dimensional objects 
our products produce physical objects from the digital output of solid or surface data from computer aided design and manufacturing  which we refer to as cad cam  and related computer systems  and include sla r and sls r systems and thermojet r solid object printers 
sla systems use our proprietary stereolithography technology  which we refer to as sl  an additive solid imaging process which uses a laser beam to expose and solidify successive layers of photosensitive resin until the desired object is formed to precise specifications in epoxy or acrylic resin 
sls systems utilize a proprietary process called selective laser sintering  which we refer to as the sls process  which uses laser energy to sinter powdered material to create solid objects from powdered materials 
ls and sl produced parts can be used for concept models  engineering prototypes  patterns and masters for molds  consumable tooling  and short run manufacturing of final product  among other applications 
thermojet solid object printers employ hot melt ink jet technology to build models in successive layers using our proprietary thermoplastic material 
these printers  about the size of an office copier  are network ready and are designed for operation in engineering and design office environments 
the thermojet printer output can be used as patterns and molds  and when combined with other secondary processes such as investment casting  can produce parts with representative end use properties 
our customers include major corporations in a broad range of industries including service bureaus and manufacturers of automotive  aerospace  computer  electronic  consumer and medical products 
our revenues are generated by product and service sales 
product sales are comprised of sales of systems and related equipment  materials  software and other component parts  as well as rentals of systems 
service and warranty sales include revenues from a variety of on site maintenance services and customer training 
for the year ended december   the continued general economic slowdown in capital equipment spending worldwide impacted both revenues and earnings 
in  sla system unit sales were down and sls system unit sales were down from comparing the combined results of d systems and dtm corporation for both periods 
this had a significant impact on both revenue and overall gross margin and we expect this to continue in we recognize the importance of recurring revenue to moderate the impact that fluctuations in capital spending has on our high end equipment revenue 
the following table reflects recurring revenues service and material sales and non recurring revenues system sales and related equipment and those revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated below years ended december  recurring sales    non recurring sales    total sales    recurring sales non recurring sales total sales the market for our capital equipment has been impacted by overall economic conditions since the second quarter of consequently  we reduced our cost structure by implementing an approximate  or employees  reduction in workforce worldwide in april of after reviewing our results for the second quarter of and the long term prospects for the worldwide economy  we took additional measures to realign our projected expenses with anticipated revenue levels 
during the third quarter of  we closed our existing facilities in austin  texas and farmington hills  michigan and reduced our workforce by an additional or employees 
as a result of these activities  we recorded charges of million and million in the quarters ending june  and september   respectively 
sales into the advanced digital manufacturing adm market continue to increase including sales related to aerospace  motorsports  jewelry  and hearing aids 
our adm revenue was million or of our overall revenue in  and we believe that the market demand for new adm applications continues to grow 
during  we placed systems into aerospace applications  a total of systems into motorsports  and systems into jewelry related applications as well as several other adm applications 
during  we announced that we are developing four new materials for use in our sls systems and the release of another series of resins for our sla systems 
new materials such as aluminum  hard steel  flame retardant nylon for commercial aerospace applications and a resin that mimics nylon material  are focused on meeting the opportunities available in adm and will significantly expand the range of applications for which we can provide solid imaging solutions 
on march   we reached a settlement agreement with vantico relating to the termination of the distribution and research and development agreement which required vantico to pay us million through payment of cash or delivery of million shares of d systems common stock 
on april   vantico delivered the million shares of our common stock to us 
under our distribution contract with vantico  we were the exclusive worldwide distributor of vantico photosensitive liquid resins for stereolithography 
our material revenue  excluding dtm related revenues  declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as a result of the termination of the distribution agreement and prices have fallen significantly as a result of increased competition 
on september   we acquired rpc  an independent supplier of stereolithography resins which has enabled us to solicit customers to transition from vantico material to rpc material 
we believe that many customers have converted to our rpc resins and that we supply approximately of the worldwide market for sl resins used in our sla systems 
we continue to focus on our resin conversion program and our overall materials business 
we are moving forward with our retail materials strategy with our accura tm sl materials which we launched on april  on july   the united states department of justice approved sony corporation as the licensee for certain of our technology  as provided for by the final judgment issued on april   by the united states district court for the district of columbia  relating to our acquisition of dtm corporation 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have granted a license to sony for certain of our north american patents and software copyrights for use only in the field of stereolithography within north america consisting of the united states  canada and mexico together with a list of our north american stereolithography customers  in exchange for a license fee of  which we received and recorded into revenue in august in addition  we recorded  in cost of sales associated with the license fee 
this license applies only to those north american patents which we owned or licensed as of april   as well as any applied for patents as of april   that cover technology marketed prior to april  for use in the field of stereolithography 
the license does not apply to technology that we may develop in the future 
the license is perpetual  assignable  transferable and non exclusive  but there is no right to sublicense except as necessary to establish distribution and to outsource manufacturing 
on august   we completed our acquisition of dtm in which we purchased all of the outstanding shares of common stock of dtm for approximately million in cash 
dtm s operations have been fully integrated into our existing business allowing us to realize synergies and cost savings 
the acquisition allows us to offer our customers an expanded product line and increases our capabilities in the areas of advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling  which we have identified as areas of significant opportunity for us for and beyond 
in february  we acquired the stock and intellectual property of optoform sarl optoform 
the optoform technology is capable of producing products with metal and ceramic properties 
the aggregate purchase price was million  of which million was settled in cash at the time of closing and million was paid in february the acquisition of optoform has allowed us to continue to expand our product offerings and increase our capabilities in the areas of advanced digital manufacturing and rapid tooling 
in september  we acquired the stock of rpc ltd  a manufacturer of sterolithography material 
the aggregate purchase price was million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make critical accounting estimates that directly impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
critical accounting estimates are estimates that meet two criteria the estimates require that we make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  there exist different estimates that could reasonably be used in the current period  or changes in the estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  both of which would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or our results of our operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  inventory  goodwill and intangible assets  contingencies and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following represent what management believes are the critical accounting policies most affected by significant management estimates and judgments 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies  the basis for their underlying assumptions and estimates and the nature of our related disclosures herein with the audit committee of the board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations for example  bankruptcy 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a reserve is established for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change for example  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact recognizing additional allowance for doubtful accounts may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet 
income taxes 
at december   the unadjusted net book value of our deferred tax assets totaled approximately million  which was principally comprised of net operating loss carryforwards of million and for credits of million 
the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  require a valuation allowance when  based upon currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas no 
provides that an important factor in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is whether there has been sufficient income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the existence of cumulative losses in recent years is an item of negative evidence that is particularly difficult to overcome 
during our fourth quarter end  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal 
also  until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we do not expect to recognize any domestic tax benefits in future periods 
we believe that our determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact of recording a valuation allowance may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet 
the determination of our income tax provision is complex due to operations in numerous tax jurisdictions outside the united states  which are subject to certain risks  which ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
tax regimes in certain jurisdictions are subject to significant changes  which may be applied on a retroactive basis 
if this were to occur  our tax expense could be materially different than the amounts reported 
furthermore  as explained in the preceding paragraph  in determining the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets  the company adopts the liability method as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method requires that we establish valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  in the company s judgment it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
our determination relating to the allowance for inventory obsolescence is subject to change because it is based on management s current estimates of required reserves and potential adjustments 
we believe that the allowance for inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact of recognizing additional obsolescence reserves may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the company has applied statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations in its allocation of the purchase price of dtm corporation dtm and rpc ltd 
rpc 
the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires the company to use its judgment and could require the company to write down the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
sfas no 
requires companies to allocate their goodwill to identifiable reporting units  which are then tested for impairment using a two step process detailed in the statement 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if that fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the second step of the process is not necessary and there are no impairment issues 
if that fair value does not exceed that carrying amount  companies must perform the second step that requires an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a purchase business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price 
the goodwill resulting from that purchase price allocation is then compared to its carrying amount with any excess recorded as an impairment charge 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in january and again in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that the fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying value and accordingly  as of that date  there were no goodwill impairment issues 
the company is required to perform a valuation of its reporting unit annually  or upon significant changes in the company s business environment 
we believe that our determination not to recognize an impairment of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change  dependent upon estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  and because the impact of recognizing an impairment may be material to the assets reported on our balance sheet and our results of operations 
contingencies 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
at this time our contingencies are not estimable and have not been recorded  however  management believes the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of systems and related products are recognized upon shipment  provided that both title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
some sales transactions are bundled and include equipment  software license  warranty  training and installation 
the company allocates and records revenue in these transactions based on vendor specific objective evidence that has been accumulated through historic operations 
the process of allocating the revenue involves some management judgments 
revenues from services are recognized at the time of performance 
we provide end users with maintenance under a warranty agreement for up to one year and defer a portion of the revenues at the time of sale based on the objective evidence for the fair value of these services 
after the initial warranty period  we offer these customers optional maintenance contracts  revenue related to these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
our warranty costs were million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s systems are sold with software products that are integral to the operation of the systems 
these software products are not sold separately 
certain of the company s sales are made through a sales agent to customers where substantial uncertainty exists with respect to collection of the sales price 
the substantial uncertainty is generally a result of the absence of a history of doing business with the customer and with respect to the uncertain political environment in the country in which the customer does business 
for these sales  the company records revenues based on the cost recovery method  which requires that the sales proceeds received are first applied to the carrying amount of the asset sold until the carrying amount has been recovered  thereafter  all proceeds are credited to sales 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair market value based method for accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in compliance with sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for its stock based employee compensation plan as defined by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and has made the applicable disclosures in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards on the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
will become effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  we are in the process of assessing the effect of sfas no 
and does not expect the implementation of the pronouncement to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we will apply fin to guarantees  if any  issued after december  we have not yet evaluated the financial statement impact of the adoption of fin fin also requires guarantors to disclose certain information for guarantees  including product warranties  outstanding at december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not expect to identify any variable interest entities that must be consolidated

product sales of million were recorded in  a decrease of compared to million for without the inclusion of the sls product line which includes materials from the sls product line  product sales of million would have been recorded for  compared to million for this decrease in product sales is due primarily to the decrease in our sales of thermojet solid object printers and related equipment of million or  a decrease in sales of our sla systems and related equipment of million or and a decrease in materials revenue of million or 
in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in which we sold a total of sla systems 
in addition  we sold sls systems in  compared to sls systems in sls unit sales from reflect the consolidated results of dtm as of august  the reduction in the number of units sold is a result of the economic slowdown worldwide during most of without the inclusion of million and million in materials revenue from the sls product line in and  respectively  materials revenue of million were recorded in  a decrease from the million recorded in the decrease in materials revenue primarily relates to lower resin volumes as we continue to solicit customers to transition from vantico material to our manufactured material 
we have recovered in excess of of the market share lost from the termination of our sales agreement with vantico through december  system orders and resultant sales may fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  acceptance of new products and the timing of product shipments 
due to the price of certain systems and the overall low unit volumes  the acceleration or delay of shipments of a small number of higher end sla systems from one period to another can significantly affect the results of operations for the periods involved 
service sales in totaled million  an increase of from million in the increase primarily reflects an increase in maintenance contract revenue  coupled with the consolidation of service revenue from the dtm acquisition 
the increase in maintenance contract revenue reflects a continued emphasis of providing a multitude of maintenance contract options to our customers and enhanced selling efforts in this area  coupled with an increase in the installed base of machines 
sales for our us operating segment for and were million and million  respectively  a decrease of 
sales for our european operating segment were million  a slight increase from the million recorded in sales for our asia pacific operating segment for were million  an increase of from the million recorded in primarily due to an increase in service revenues 
as noted above  the economic slowdown worldwide has impacted our overall sales for this was partially offset by the addition of dtm revenue for four months in and twelve months in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million or of sales in from million or of sales in without the inclusion of the sls product line  cost of sales were million or of sales in and million or in product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in without the inclusion of the sls product line  product cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was in and in the increase as a percent of product sales in compared to is due primarily to a shift in the sales mix from higher end sla systems to our smaller systems  which have lower margins 
the lower end systems appeal to a broader base of customers and we anticipate that the lost margin will be recovered over time by the increased sales volume 
service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales increased to in fiscal year from in the increase is due to an increase in fixed costs of the company s education centers  centers at which we train customers to use our products  and technology centers  attributable to the addition of the sls product line 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million in and million for the increase primarily reflects additional expenses related to bad debt expense  directors and officers insurance  group medical benefits and professional fees 
in addition  sg a expenses for dtm are included for the full year in and four months in from the acquisition date 
these expenses are partially offset by head count related cost savings net of employee severance 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in increased to million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to development costs related to the invision si d printer and the decision to maintain our facility in austin  texas acquired from dtm

due to our recent decrease in our workforce  including closing the facility in austin  we anticipate future research and development expenses to be more in line with historical levels related to revenues 
loss income from operations

sales in were million  an increase of from the million recorded in sales for reflect the consolidated results of dtm as of august  the sls product line of machines and materials contributed million in revenue in product sales of million were recorded in  an increase of compared to million for the increase in product revenue is primarily due to the consolidation of the results of dtm  with sales from the sls product line of million 
without the consolidation of dtm  product sales of million would have been recorded for  compared to million for this decrease in product sales is due primarily to the decrease in sales of sla systems and related equipment of million or 
the decrease in machine sales primarily resulted from decreased sales of the higher end sla systems  especially the sla system  primarily due to a general economic decline in higher dollar capital equipment purchases by customers 
in  we sold a total of sla systems compared to in although sales of our higher end sla systems in were below the prior year  sales of our newly introduced viper si sla system exceeded expectations  with units sold in the viper si sla system became generally available on july  excluding the consolidation of million in materials revenue from dtm  materials revenue of million were recorded in  a slight decrease from the million recorded in the decrease in material revenue primarily reflects the sale of fewer large frame sla units 
we believe that the termination of our agreements with vantico  coupled with our acquisition of rpc  may have also impacted materials revenue 
system orders and resultant sales may fluctuate on a yearly basis as a result of a number of other factors  including world economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  acceptance of new products and the timing of product shipments

service cost of sales as a percentage of service sales decreased to in fiscal year from in the decrease is due to a change in the mix of service sales from time and materials and other service revenues to maintenance contract revenues in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a totaled million in and million for the increase primarily reflects expenses from the dtm acquisition  acquisition related amortization costs  legal fees related to the vantico arbitration  and bad debt write offs in the fourth quarter of additionally  the first six months of reflect an overall increase in personnel expenses and other costs as we continued to build infrastructure to support anticipated revenue growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in increased to million compared to million in excluding the results of dtm  research and development expenses were million in  or of sales compared with million in  or of sales 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to development costs related to the invision si d printer and the initial decision to maintain our facility in austin  texas

liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december in thousands cash and cash equivalents    working deficit capital    cash provided by operating activities    cash used for investing activities    cash provided by financing activities    going concern the consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern 
the company incurred operating losses totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and has an accumulated deficit of million at december  these factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
as of june   the company had cash balances of million  of which million was restricted  and million was available under a bank line of credit available to meet current obligations 
further  the company is obligated under its existing line of credit to have a commitment letter from a substitute lender by september  failure to obtain a commitment letter from an acceptable lender will cause the amount under the line of credit to become immediately due 
management has obtained a proposal from congress financial  a subsidiary of wachovia  to provide a secured revolving credit facility of up to million 
the proposal is contingent on congress financial completing due diligence to its satisfaction and other conditions 
we cannot assure you that over the next twelve months or thereafter we will generate funds from operations or that capital will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources to fund future operating costs  debt service obligations and capital requirements 
our operations are not currently profitable 
our ability to continue operations is uncertain if we are not successful in obtaining outside funding 
management plans to continue raising additional capital to fund operations 
the lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow or raise financing from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would  therefore  have a material adverse effect on its business 
further  we cannot assure you that any necessary funds  if available  will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significantly dilutive effect on the company s existing shareholders 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of asset carrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
net cash provided by operating activities in of million primarily results from the decrease in the accounts receivable balance of million and the decrease of inventories of million partially offset by a net loss of million which included a non cash gain from the vantico settlement of million  a non cash charge of million resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million 
furthermore  cash provided by operations was decreased due to a decrease in accounts payable of million and other liabilities of million 
net cash used for investing activities in of million primarily relates to additions to licenses and patents of million related to legal defense and new patent filings  additions to property and equipment of million for machinery and equipment  the scheduled payments for the optoform acquisition of million  and million in payments for the rpc acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million primarily reflects million in proceeds from the sale of stock and million in additional borrowings partially offset by million in debt repayment 
on august   we completed a million variable rate industrial development bond financing of our colorado facility 
interest on the bonds is payable monthly the interest rate at december  was 
principal payments are payable in semi annual installments through august the bonds are collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by wells fargo bank  na that is further collateralized by a standby letter of credit issued by us bank in the amount of million 
at december   a total of million was outstanding under the bond 
the terms of the letter of credit require us to maintain specific levels of minimum tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were not in compliance with these covenants at december  on march   wells fargo sent a letter to the company stating that it was in default of the fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth covenants of the reimbursement agreement relating to the letter of credit 
the bank provided the company until april   to cure these defaults 
on may   wells fargo drew down a letter of credit in the amount million which was held as partial security under the reimbursement agreement relating to the letter of credit underlying the bonds and placed the cash in a restricted account 
the company obtained a waiver for the defaults from the wells fargo bank in a letter dated june   provided that the company meet certain terms and conditions 
the company must remain in compliance with all other provisions of the reimbursement agreement for this letter of credit 
in addition  on or before september   the company must provide wells fargo with evidence of a proposal from another bank to replace this letter of credit  or should a replacement letter of credit not be obtained on or before december   the company will agree to retire million of the bonds using the restricted cash 
wells fargo has accepted the proposal letter from congress financial as satisfying the requirement in the waiver agreement 
on august   the company entered into a loan agreement with us bank totaling million  in order to finance the acquisition of dtm 
the financing arrangement consisted of a million three year revolving credit facility and a million month commercial term loan 
at december   a total of million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under the term loan 
the interest rate at december   for the revolving credit facility and term loan was and  respectively 
the interest rate is computed as either the prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  or the day adjusted libor plus a margin ranging from to 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  us bank has received a first priority security interest in our accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and general intangible assets 
the company paid million of loan origination fees and costs to us bank during in connection with this loan 
on may  the company entered into waiver agreement number two with us bank whereby us bank waived all financial covenant violations at december  and march  the events of default caused by the company s failure to timely submit audited financial statements and failure to make the march  principal payment of million were also waived 
the agreement requires the company to obtain additional equity investments of at least million  to pay off the balance on the term loan of million by may   to increase the applicable interest rate to prime plus  and to pay a  waiver fee and all related costs of drafting the agreement 
us bank has also agreed to waive the company s compliance with each financial covenant in the loan agreement through september  provided the company obtains a commitment letter from a qualified lending institution by september   to refinance all of the outstanding obligations with us bank  the waiver will be extended to the earlier of december   or the expiration date of the commitment letter 
through the date of this filing the company has complied with all aspects of waiver agreement number two including the receipt of equity investments of million and the million principal repayment of the term loan 
on may   we sold  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock at a price of per share for aggregate consideration of million 
the preferred stock accrues dividends at per share and is convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
the stock is redeemable at the company s option at any time after the third anniversary date 
the company must redeem any shares of preferred stock outstanding on the tenth anniversary date 
the redemption price is equal to per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
net proceeds to us from these transactions were million 
on may   we repurchased  shares of our common stock from vantico 
on that same date we sold  shares of our common stock to accredited investors in a private placement transaction 
these shares were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act 
net proceeds to us from these transactions were million 
we lease certain facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring through december the leases are generally on a net rent basis  whereby we pay taxes  maintenance and insurance 
leases that expire are expected to be renewed or replaced by leases on other properties 
rental expense for the years ended december   and  aggregated million  million and million  respectively 
the future contractual payments are as follows later contractual obligations years total line of credit   term loan   industrial development bond   subordinated debt   operating leases      total contractual obligations       in addition to the foregoing contractual commitments in connection with the acquisition of rpc  the company has guaranteed the value of an aggregate of  shares of common stock underlying warrants issued to the former rpc shareholders 
if the fair market value of our common stock is less than on september   then each warrant holder has the right to receive  in exchange for the warrant  an amount equal to chf approximately at june  multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock then underlying the warrant 
the value of this commitment at the acquisition date was million and was included in the purchase price of rpc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our aggregate potential liability at december  was approximately million 
payment in cash is due within days of exercise of the guaranty right by the warrant holder 
in order to preserve cash  we have been required to reduce expenditures for capital projects  research and development  and in our corporate infrastructure  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
further reductions in our cash balances could require us to make more significant cuts in our operations  which would have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
we cannot assure you that we can achieve adequate savings from these reductions over a short enough period of time in order to allow us to continue as a going concern 
in the event we are unable to generate cash flow and achieve our estimated cost savings  we will need to aggressively seek additional debt or equity financing and other strategic alternatives 
however  recent operating losses  our declining cash balances  our historical stock performance  the ongoing inquiries into certain matters relating to our revenue recognition and the general economic downturn may make it difficult for us to attract equity investments or debt financing or strategic partners on terms that are deemed favorable to us 
if our financial condition continues to worsen and we are unable to attract equity or debt financing or other strategic transactions  we could be forced to consider steps that would protect our assets against our creditors 
cautionary statements and risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in that event the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
risks arising from recent events our independent auditors report expresses doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december   our independent auditors report  dated june   includes an explanatory paragraph relating to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have experienced significant operating losses in each quarter of fiscal and in preceding years 
our cash and short term investment balances have continued to decline since december   and we expect to experience further declining balances 
we have failed to meet our financial covenants under our bank agreements and our reimbursement agreement relating to our municipal bond financing 
us bank has waived our compliance with the financial covenants in our loan agreement with them through september  and subject to obtaining a commitment letter from a qualified lending institution by september  to refinance all of our outstanding obligations with us bank  the waiver will be extended to the earlier of december   or the expiration date of the commitment letter 
wells fargo has waived compliance with certain covenants  provided that we remain in compliance with all other provisions of the reimbursement agreement 
the waiver extends through december  provided that if we do not obtain a letter of credit to replace wells fargo on or before december   we agree to retire of the bonds through the use of restricted cash 
if we are unable to obtain a commitment letter as required under the us bank waiver  we will need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to pay off the bank loan or we will be in default 
we are primarily reliant on cash generated from operations to meet our cash requirements 
in order to preserve cash  we have been required to reduce expenditures for capital projects  research and development  and in our corporate infrastructure  any of which may have a material adverse affect on our future operations 
further reductions in our cash balances could require us to make more significant reductions in our operations  which would have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
we cannot assure you that we can generate sufficient cash from operations and realize our anticipated cost savings in order to allow us to continue as a going concern 
in the event we are unable to generate cash flow and achieve our estimated cost savings  or unable to enter into a commitment letter to refinance the us bank loan by september   we will need to aggressively seek additional debt or equity financing and other strategic alternatives 
however  recent operating losses  our declining cash balances  our historical stock performance  the ongoing inquiries into certain matters relating to our revenue recognition and the general economic downturn may make it difficult for us to attract equity investments or debt financing or strategic partners on terms that are deemed favorable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we will not be able to accomplish any or all of our initiatives and could be forced to consider steps that would protect our assets against our creditors 
the inquiry initiated by sec may lead to charges or penalties and may adversely affect our business 
if any government inquiry or other investigation leads to charges against us  we likely will be harmed by negative publicity  the costs of litigation  the diversion of management time  and other negative effects  even if we ultimately prevail 
the sec has inquired into matters pertaining to our revenue recognition practices 
our audit committee has met  and cooperated fully  with the sec 
to date  the company has not been notified that the sec has initiated a formal investigation 
this matter is pending and continues to require management attention and resources 
any adverse finding by the sec may lead to significant fines and penalties and limitations on our activities and may harm our relationships with existing customers and impair our ability to attract new customers 
the filing of our restated financial statements will not necessarily resolve the sec inquiry 
our common stock is trading on the nasdaq national market under an exception from the continued listing requirements 
if we fail to file our first quarter q by july   or fail to timely file any other periodic report due by december   nasdaq will delist our common stock and  as a consequence  fewer investors  especially institutional investors  will be willing to invest in our company  our stock price will decline  and it will be difficult to raise money on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if nasdaq delists our common stock  it could become subject to the securities and exchange commission penny stock rules 
penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than per share that are not registered on a national securities exchange or quoted on the nasdaq system 
broker dealers dealing in our common stock would then be subject to additional burdens which may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could make it difficult for investors to sell their shares and  consequently  limit the liquidity of our common stock 
in addition  if nasdaq delists our common stock  we expect that some or all of the following circumstances will occur  which likely will cause a further decline in our trading price and make it more difficult to raise funds 
there will be less liquidity in our common stock  
there will be fewer institutional and other investors that will consider investing in our common stock  
there will be fewer market makers in our common stock  
there will be less information available concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock  and 
there will be fewer broker dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock 
finance our debt level could adversely affect our financial health and affect our ability to run our business 
as of june   our debt was million  of which million was current borrowings and million related to convertible and preferred instruments 
this level of debt could have important consequences to you as a holder of shares 
below we have identified for you some of the material potential consequences resulting from this significant amount of debt 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 

our ability to adapt to changing market conditions may be hampered 
we may be more vulnerable in a volatile market and at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt 

our operating flexibility is more limited due to financial and other restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties  making acquisitions and paying dividends 

we will be subject to the risks that interest rates and our interest expense will increase 

our ability to plan for  or react to  changes in our business is more limited 
under certain circumstances  we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
if we add new debt  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
our balance sheet contains several categories of intangible assets that we may be required to write off or write down based on the future performance of the company  which may adversely impact our future earnings and our stock price 
as of december   we had million of unamortized intangible assets  including goodwill  licenses and patents  other intellectual property  and certain expenses that we amortize over time 
any material impairment to any of these items could reduce our net income and may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we currently have million in goodwill capitalized on our balance sheet 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires among other things  the discontinuance of the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives  and the introduction of impairment testing in its place 
under sfas  goodwill and some indefinite lived intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually  with impairment being measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over its fair value 
in addition  goodwill and intangible assets will be tested more often for impairment as circumstances warrant  and may result in write downs of some of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
accordingly  we could  from time to time  incur impairment charges  which will be recorded as operating expenses and will reduce our net income and adversely affect our operating results 
we currently have approximately million related to a license fee prepaid in related to the solid object printer machine platform included under license and patent costs  net  in our financial statements 
the amortization of this intangible is based on the number of solid object printer units sold 
if future sales of the solid object printer machine platforms do not increase  then a more rapid rate of amortization of this balance will be required relative to the number of units sold 
we are carrying a significant amount of model related inventory and tooling costs for a solid object printer machine platform 
we are carrying approximately million in inventory and tooling cost associated with the development and production of a new solid object printer machine platform 
changes to the bill of material as a result of the design validation testing  or abandonment of the new platform because of adverse market studies  may render inventory and tooling obsolete 
additionally  we continue to carry inventory and have vendor commitments related to our existing solid object printer model totaling million  which if not sold  could become obsolete 
a significant write down of inventory and tooling due to obsolescence could adversely affect our results of operations 
the mix of products we sell affects our overall profit margins 
we continuously expand our product offerings  including our materials  and work to increase the number of geographic markets in which we operate and the distribution channels we use in order to reach our various target markets and customers 
this variety of products  markets and channels results in a range of gross margins and operating income which can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations depending on the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter 
we may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross margins or net income due to the impact of the mix of products  channels  or geographic markets utilized from period to period 
more recently  our mix of products sold has reflected increased sales of our lower end systems  which have reduced gross margins as compared to the high end sla systems 
if this trend continues over time  we may experience lower average gross margins and returns 
we may be subject to product liability claims 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that  despite our testing  are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers  which could result in delayed market acceptance of the product or damage to our reputation and business 
we attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products 
however  the nature and extent of such limitations vary from customer to customer  and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future 
the sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  regardless of its merit  could result in material expense to us  diversion of management time and attention  and damage to our business reputation and ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
operations we face significant competition in many aspects of our business and this competition is likely to increase in the future we compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment for models  prototypes and other dimensional objects  ranging from traditional model makers and subtractive type producers  such as cnc machine makers  to a wide variety of additive solid imaging system manufacturers as well as service bureaus that provide any or all of these types of technology  and producers of materials and services for this equipment 
some of our existing and potential competitors are researching  designing  developing and marketing other types of equipment  materials and services 
any reduction in our research and development efforts could affect our ability to compete effectively 
many of our competitors have financial  marketing  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
in many cases  the existence of these competitors extends the purchase decision time as customers investigate the alternative products and solutions 
under a settlement agreement with the department of justice relating to our merger with dtm  we were required to license certain of our patents for use in the manufacture and sale of either stereolithography or laser sintering products  but not both  in north america 
on june   we entered into a license agreement with sony corporation  pursuant to which they would license our patents for use in the field of stereolithography in north america defined as the united states  canada and mexico 
on july   we were informed by the department of justice that they had approved sony as our licensee 
although stereolithography is a very small part of its activities  and sony has thus far only been able to be active in the japanese asia pacific region  sony is an extremely large and sophisticated corporation with annual revenues in excess of billion 
we cannot be certain of the market impact of the license to sony  however we anticipate that sony will be an aggressive competitor in all aspects of our stereolithography business 
our material revenue  excluding dtm related revenues  declined significantly for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this was due to the termination of our liquid resin research and development agreements with vantico on april  we had jointly developed liquid photopolymers with vantico and served as the exclusive worldwide distributor except in japan of these materials 
sales of these materials accounted for and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
sales of our materials excluding the ls product line accounted for and of our total revenues for and respectively 
on september   we acquired rpc  an independent supplier of stereolithography resins located in switzerland and many customers have converted from vantico material to our rpc resins 
however  prices have fallen significantly as a result of increased competition 
in addition  our management team does not have substantial experience in the materials development and manufacturing business 
in addition  the manufacture of materials business increases some of the existing risks we face and poses new risks to our company 
for example  we must comply with all applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations associated with large scale manufacturing of resins in switzerland 
our compliance with these laws may increase our cost of production and reduce our margins and any failure to comply with these laws may result in legal or regulatory action instituted against us  substantial monetary fines or other damages 
in addition we entered into a two year non exclusive distribution agreement for the sale of a line of resins produced by another chemical manufacturer 
we also face significant competition in the supply of nylon powdered materials for laser sintering equipment where we have a leading position 
in north america this competition is the subject of a patent infringement suit against eos 
we entered into two agreements with chemical manufacturers for the development  manufacture  and distribution of new nylon powder materials as well as a third agreement for the development of a new aluminum powder material 
we also expect future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques  both additive and subtractive  for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents  from the issuance of patents to other companies that inhibit our ability to develop certain products  and from the improvement to existing material and equipment technologies 
we have determined to follow a strategy of continuing product development and aggressive patent prosecution to protect our position to the extent practicable 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition 
if we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products  we may lose revenue and market share 
we are affected by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices  any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology and systems obsolete 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to 
obtain leading technologies useful in our business  
enhance our existing products  
develop new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers  particularly in the area of material functionality  
respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis  and 
recruit and retain key technology employees 
we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial expense protecting our patents and proprietary rights  which we believe are critical to our success 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we intend to pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and other proprietary rights 
we have incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition and could cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
as of december   we held patents  which include in the united states  in europe  in japan  and in other foreign jurisdictions 
at that date  we also had pending patent applications in the united states  in japan  in european countries and other foreign countries 
as we discover new developments and components to our technology  we intend to apply for additional patents 
effective trademark  service mark  copyright  patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available 
we cannot assure you that the pending patent applications will be granted or that we have taken adequate steps to protect our proprietary rights  especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop or initiate technologies that are substantially similar or superior to ours 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain a meaningful technological advantage over our competitors 
we currently are involved in several patent infringement actions  both as plaintiff and as defendant 
at december   we had capitalized million in legal costs related to various litigation  which if not settled favorably  would need to be written off and would have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our ability to fully protect and exploit our patents and proprietary rights could be adversely impacted by the level of expense required for intellectual property litigation 
we  as successor to dtm  currently are involved in intellectual property litigation  the outcome of which could materially and adversely affect us 
on august   we completed our acquisition of dtm 
as the successor to dtm  we face direct competition for selective laser sintering equipment and materials outside the united states from eos gmbh of planegg  germany  which we refer to in this report as eos 
prior to our acquisition  dtm had been involved in significant litigation with eos in france  germany  italy  japan and the united states with regard to its proprietary rights to selective laser sintering technology 
eos has also challenged the validity of patents related to laser sintering in the european patent office and the japanese patent office 
in addition  eos filed a patent infringement suit against dtm in federal court in california alleging that dtm infringed certain us patents that we license to eos 
our inability to resolve the claims or to prevail in any related litigation could result in a finding of infringement of our licensed patents 
additionally  one eos patent is asserted which  if found valid and infringed  could preclude the continued development and sale of certain of our laser sintering products that incorporate the intellectual property that is the subject of the patent 
in addition  we may become obligated to pay substantial monetary damages for past infringement 
regardless of the outcome of these actions we will continue to incur significant related expenses and costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
furthermore  these actions could involve a substantial diversion of the time of some members of management 
the failure to preserve our laser sintering intellectual property rights and the costs associated with these actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition and could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for specified components 
if these relationships terminate  our business may be disrupted while we locate an alternative supplier 
we subcontract for manufacture of material laser sintering components  powdered sintering materials and accessories from a single source third party supplier 
there are several potential suppliers of the material components  parts and subassemblies for our stereolithography products 
however  we currently use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of the critical components  parts and subassemblies  including our lasers  materials and certain ink jet components 
our reliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves many risks including 
shortages of some key components  
product performance shortfalls  and 
reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capabilities  quality and costs 
if any of our suppliers suffers business disruptions  financial difficulties  or if there is any significant change in the condition of our relationship with the supplier  our costs of goods sold may increase or we may be unable to obtain these key components for our products 
in either event  our revenues  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition would be adversely affected 
while we believe we can obtain most of the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers  any unanticipated change in the source of our supplies  or unanticipated supply limitations  could adversely affect our ability to meet our product orders 
our ability to retain existing customers  and attract new customers may be impaired as a result of questions raised by our revenue recognition issues 
our improper recognition of revenue with regard to certain sales transactions  the ensuing audit committee investigation and the adjustments to previously filed financial statements could seriously harm our relationships with existing customers and impair our ability to attract new customers 
customers who purchase our products make a significant long term commitment to the use of our technology 
our products often become an integral part of each customer s facility and our customers look to us to provide continuing support  enhancements and new versions of our products 
because of the long term nature of a commitment in some of our products  customers are often concerned about the stability of their suppliers 
purchasing decisions by potential and existing customers have been and may continue to be postponed  we believe in part due to our improper recognition of revenue and the ensuing audit committee investigation 
the failure to timely file our k and q and the adjustments to our previously filed financial statements may cause existing and potential customers concern over our stability and these concerns may cause us to lose sales 
any loss in sales could adversely affect our results of operations  further deepening concern among current and potential customers 
if potential and existing customers lose confidence in us  our competitive position in our industry may be seriously harmed and our revenues could further decline 
the audit committee investigation into our revenue recognition issues and our recent reductions in work force  have caused turnover in our finance and sales which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the recent departure of key accounting  finance and sales personnel may cause delays in completing our business initiatives and adversely impact our organization s institutional knowledge regarding key policies  significant contracts and agreements  and other key facts 
we have experienced substantial turnover in our employees  including senior members of our finance  accounting and sales departments  since the commencement of the audit committee investigation 
in addition  in  we completed substantial reductions in our workforce and closed our office in austin  texas  which we acquired as part of our acquisition of dtm and our sales office in farmington hills  michigan 
many of these departed employees had significant experience with our market  as well as relationships with many of our existing and potential customers and business partners 
it will take substantial time for new employees to develop an in depth understanding of our market and to form significant relationships with our customers and partners 
in addition  the reductions in force may lead to reduced employee morale and productivity  increased attrition and difficulty retaining existing employees and recruiting future employees  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we are seeking a significant number of new members to our organization 
our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to identify  hire  train  assimilate and retain an adequate number of highly qualified finance  sales  engineering  marketing  managerial and support personnel 
despite the current economic downturn  the competition for qualified employees in our industry is particularly intense and it can be difficult to attract and retain quality employees at reasonable cost 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain these persons our development and introduction of new products could be delayed and our ability to compete successfully could be impaired 
we face risks associated with conducting business internationally and if we do not manage these risks  our results of operations may suffer 
a material portion of our sales is to customers in foreign countries 
there are many risks inherent in our international business activities that  unless managed properly  may adversely affect our profitability  including our ability to collect amounts due from customers 
our foreign operations could be adversely affected by 
unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
export controls  tariffs and other barriers  
social and political risks  
fluctuations in currency exchange rates  
seasonal reductions in business activity in certain parts of the world  particularly during the summer months in europe  
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  
difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  
taxation  and 
other factors  depending on the country in which an opportunity arises 
political and economic events and the uncertainty resulting from them may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   along with the united states military campaign against terrorism in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere and continued violence in the middle east have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and revenues 
the disruption of our business as a result of these events  including disruptions and deferrals of customer purchasing decisions  had an immediate adverse impact on our business 
since september   some economic commentators have indicated that spending on capital equipment of the type that we sell has been weaker than spending in the economy as a whole  and many of our customers are in industries that are also viewed as under performing the overall economy  such as the automobile and telecommunication industries 
the long term effects of these events on our customers  the market for our common stock  the markets for our services and the us economy as a whole are uncertain 
the consequences of any additional terrorist attacks  or any expanded armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our markets  or our business 
management the loss of brian service  our chief executive officer  or our inability to attract and retain qualified executives could materially and adversely affect our business 
our ability to develop and expand our products  business and markets and to manage our growth is dependent upon the services of our executive team  including brian service  who currently is employed as chief executive officer 
we do not maintain any key life insurance coverage for mr 
service or any other member of our executive team 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional key technical  management and other personnel 
competition for these professionals is intense 
the loss of the services of any of our key executives or the failure to attract and retain other key personnel could impair the development of new products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
capital structure our operating results vary from quarter to quarter  which could impact our stock price 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
in some quarters it is possible that results could be below expectations of analysts and investors 
if so  the price of our common stock may decline 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  may cause these fluctuations in operating results 
these factors include 
acceptance and reliability of new products in the market  
size and timing of product shipments  
currency and economic fluctuations in foreign markets and other factors affecting international sales  
price competition  
delays in the introduction of new products  
general worldwide economic conditions  
changes in the mix of products and services sold  
impact of ongoing litigation  and 
impact of changing technologies 
in addition  certain of our components require an order lead time of three months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become more difficult to obtain in the future 
we may experience delays in the receipt of some key components 
to meet forecasted production levels  we may be required to commit to long lead time prior to receiving orders for our products 
if our forecasts exceed actual orders  we may hold large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
volatility of stock price 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
historically  our stock price has been volatile 
the prices of the common stock have ranged from to during the week period ended may  factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock include 
future announcements concerning our developments or those of our competitors  including the receipt of substantial orders for products  
quality deficiencies in services or products  
results of technological innovations  
new commercial products  
changes in recommendations of securities analysts  
proprietary rights or product  patent or other litigation  and 
sales or purchase of substantial blocks of stock 
takeover defense provisions may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
various provisions of our corporate governance documents and of delaware law  together with our shareholders rights plan  may inhibit changes in control not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of depriving you of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the event of an attempted hostile takeover 
the board is authorized to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock  of which approximately million is outstanding or reserved for issuance 
the board also is authorized to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock 
our ability to issue preferred stock gives us flexibility concerning possible acquisitions and financing  but it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  any preferred stock to be issued may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
in addition  provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts or making it more difficult for stockholders to change management 
we are subject to delaware laws that could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of the company 
one of these laws prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date that the person became an interested stockholder  unless certain conditions are met 
in addition  we have adopted a shareholders rights plan 
under the shareholders rights plan  we distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our debentures and exercise of our series b convertible preferred stock could dilute your ownership and negatively impact the market price for our common stock 
our shares of series b convertible preferred stock are convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
our subordinated debt is convertible at any time into approximately  shares of common stock 
to the extent that all of the shares of preferred stock and debentures are converted  a significantly greater number of shares of our common stock will be outstanding and the interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted 
moreover  future sales of substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and long term debt 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds or other high quality investments 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to this factor  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility and term loan with us bank  which have variable interest rates 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our term loan 
the interest rates at december  for the revolving credit facility and the term loan were and  respectively 
the revolving credit facility expires in this loan was paid off in may we have an industrial development bond on our colorado facility  which has an outstanding balance of million 
we will make annual principal payments of      for the years ending     and  thereafter 
the bond has a variable interest rate and the interest rate at december  was 
an increase or decrease in the variable interest rate of would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by  we have not entered into any hedging contracts to protect ourselves against future changes in interest rates  which could negatively impact the amount of interest we are required to pay 
however  we do not feel that this risk is significant and we do not plan to attempt to hedge to mitigate this risk in the foreseeable future 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold convertible subordinate debentures 
as of december  we received million in proceeds from this sale 
we received additional proceeds of  in january  for a total of million 
the convertible debentures are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock immediately at the option of the holder or at our discretion at any time after december   and prior to maturity at december  the debentures bear interest at the rate of payable quarterly 
the chairman of the board of directors and related parties contributed million to the completion of the convertible debentures 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of long term debt exposure as of december  are as follows carrying payments amount later years fair value line of credit    interest rate term loan    interest rate industry development bond    interest rate subordinated debt    foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenue in international sales are made primarily from our foreign sales subsidiaries in their respective countries and are denominated in united states dollars or the local currency of each country 
these subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from inter company accounts in which costs incurred in the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these inter company accounts are typically denominated in united states dollars 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the realized effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in resulted in a million gain 
as of december   we had investments in foreign operations that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables 
the net amount that is exposed in foreign currency when subjected to a change in the value of the functional currency versus the non functional currency produces an approximate million change in our balance sheet as of december  the company uses derivative instruments to manage exposure to foreign currency risk 
the company manages selected exposures through financial market transactions in the form of foreign exchange forward and put option contracts 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on its consolidated net loss income 
the company has no put option contracts in place on december  the notional amount covered by all of our put option contracts was million at december  the put options were related to transactions denominated in euros and pounds sterling  with settlement dates in january and february the premium paid for the put options was  in  and the market value was approximately  at december
