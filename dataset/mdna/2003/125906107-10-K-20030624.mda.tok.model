critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable reserves  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingency accruals and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
revenue revenue is recognized only upon delivery  when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
the company also records estimated reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damaged in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase or decrease significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
accounts receivable the company offers seasonal dating programs related to certain seasonal product offerings pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms 
customers generally do not have the right to return product except for rights to return that the company believes are typical of our industry for reasons such as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
the company generally is not required to repurchase products from its customers  nor does the company have any regular practice of doing so 
in addition  the company minimizes its exposure to bad debts by evaluating the creditworthiness of its major customers and purchasing credit insurance when appropriate 
bad debt and returns and allowances reserves are recorded as an offset to accounts receivables while reserves for customer programs are recorded as accrued liabilities 
the company evaluates accounts receivable related reserves and accruals monthly by specifically reviewing customer accounts and by reference to historical experience 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is primarily determined by the first in  first out method although certain inventories are valued based on the last in  first out method 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
product development costs product development costs consist of purchases of outside artwork  printing plates and cylinders 
the company classifies these costs as a prepaid expense 
product development costs are incurred approximately to months before the holiday event and are amortized monthly over the selling season  generally within two to four months of the respective holiday event 
product development expense is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  however  goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test  the first step of which must be performed at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense  except at the transition date  when the loss is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in determining the fair value of the reporting units  the company utilizes cash flow models reflecting the expected range of future cash flow outcomes over the life of the model 
these cash flows are then discounted to the measurement date using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the development of these cash flow models is based on management estimates and assumptions about future operating results  including revenues and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
