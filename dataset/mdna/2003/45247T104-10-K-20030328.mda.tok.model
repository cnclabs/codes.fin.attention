imagistics spin off from pitney bowes on december   the board of directors of pitney bowes inc pitney bowes approved the spin off of the us and us operations of its office systems business to its common stockholders as an independent  publicly traded company 
on december   imagistics was spun off from pitney bowes pursuant to a contribution by pitney bowes of substantially all of pitney bowes office systems businesses to us and a distribution of our common stock to common stockholders of pitney bowes based on a distribution ratio of share of our common stock for every shares of pitney bowes common stock held at the close of business on november  the distribution or spin off 
pitney bowes no longer has a financial investment in our business 
we entered into a transition services agreement with pitney bowes providing for certain essential services to us for a limited period following the distribution 
these services were provided at cost and included information technology  computing  telecommunications  accounting  field service of equipment and dispatch call center services 
for and for the period from december  through december   we paid pitney bowes million and million  respectively  in connection with these services under the transition services agreement 
we and pitney bowes have agreed to an extension until june  or  upon our request  december   of the transition services agreement as it relates to information technology and related services due to unanticipated delays in our implementation of phase ii of the enterprise resource planning erp system 
services provided under this extension are at negotiated market rates 
we also entered into certain other agreements covering intellectual property  commercial relationships  leases and licensing arrangements and tax separation matters 
the pricing terms of the products and services covered by the other commercial agreements reflect negotiated prices 
the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the distribution include allocations of certain pitney bowes corporate expenses 
corporate expense allocations were charged based generally on the ratio of our costs and expenses to pitney bowes costs and expenses 
pitney bowes allocated expenses primarily included administrative expenses such as accounting services  real estate costs  customer service support in remote geographic areas and information technology and amounted to million for the period from january  through the distribution and million for we believe the costs of these services charged to us were a reasonable representation of the services provided or benefits received by us 
in addition  interest expense was charged to us from pitney bowes based upon the proportion of our net assets to pitney bowes net assets 
we believe that this is a reasonable method of allocation 
as part of pitney bowes  we also benefited from various economies of scale  including shared global administrative functions and shared facilities 
our costs and expenses have and may continue to increase as a result of the loss of these economies of scale and we may incur greater expenses associated with our status as a stand alone public company 
basis of financial statement presentation the consolidated financial statements include certain historical assets  liabilities and related operations of the united states and united kingdom office systems businesses  which were contributed to us from pitney bowes prior to the distribution 
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  depict our results as a stand alone company 
the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the distribution were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of pitney bowes using the historical results of operations and historical basis of assets and liabilities of the united states and united kingdom office systems businesses 
prior to the formation of imagistics  the office systems business was operated as a division of pitney bowes  and  as such  pitney bowes investment in imagistics is shown in lieu of stockholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for we began accumulating retained earnings on the date of the distribution 
we believe the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and are reasonable 
however  the consolidated financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future or what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows as of and for the years ended december  and would have been for periods prior to the distribution had we operated as a stand alone entity during those periods 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include assessing the allocation of costs from pitney bowes  the collectibility of accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the useful lives of tangible assets  the realization of deferred taxes and an evaluation of the potential impairment  if any  of goodwill  among others 
the markets for our products are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological development and pricing pressures  all of which could affect the future realizability of our assets 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified certain accounting policies that are critical to the understanding of our results of operations due to the judgment management must make in their application 
these significant accounting policies are outlined below 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment and supplies sales is recognized when contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for copier equipment  the satisfaction of contractual obligations and the passing of title and risk of loss to the customer occur upon the installation of the copier equipment at the customer location 
for facsimile equipment and facsimile supplies  the satisfaction of contractual obligations and the passing of title and risk of loss to the customer occur upon the delivery of the facsimile equipment and the facsimile supplies to the customer location 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances based upon historical experience 
rental contracts  which often include supplies  are generally for an initial term of three years with automatic renewals unless we receive prior notice of cancellation 
under the terms of rental contracts  we bill our customers either a flat periodic charge or a usage based fee 
revenues related to these contracts are recognized each month as earned  either using the straight line method or based upon usage  as applicable 
support services contracts  which often include supplies  are generally for an initial term of one year with automatic renewals unless we receive prior notice of cancellation 
under the terms of support services contracts  we bill our customers either a flat periodic charge or a usage based fee 
revenues related to these contracts are recognized each month as earned  either using the straight line method or based upon usage  as applicable 
certain rental and support services contracts provide for invoicing in advance  generally quarterly 
revenue on contracts billed in advance is deferred and recognized as earned revenue over the billed period 
certain rental and support services contracts provide for invoicing in arrears  generally quarterly 
revenue on contracts billed in arrears is accrued and recognized in the period in which it is earned 
we enter into arrangements that include multiple deliverables  which typically consist of the sale of equipment with a support services contract 
we account for each element within an arrangement with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the residual method  which requires the allocation of the revenue based on the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of support services is primarily determined by reference to renewal pricing 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value by recording allowances for those accounts receivable amounts that we believe are uncollectible 
our estimate of losses is based on prior collection experience including evaluating the credit worthiness of each of our customers  analyzing historical bad debt write offs and reviewing the aging of the receivables 
our allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for specific accounts that we believe are uncollectible  as well as amounts that have been computed by applying certain percentages based on historic loss trends  to certain accounts receivable aging categories 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions  when required  are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values 
inventory provisions are calculated using management s best estimates of inventory value based on the age of the inventory  quantities on hand compared with historical and projected usage and current and anticipated demands 
depreciation of rental equipment rental equipment is comprised of equipment on rent to customers and is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
copier equipment is depreciated over three years and facsimile equipment is depreciated over five years 
capitalized computer software costs we capitalize certain costs of internally developed software 
internal capitalized costs include purchased materials and services and payroll and payroll related costs 
costs for general and administrative  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
the cost of internally developed software is amortized on a straight line basis over appropriate periods  principally three to seven years 
the unamortized balance of internally developed software is included in fixed assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead would be reviewed periodically for impairment with any resulting impairment charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and intangibles is more than their fair value 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount is greater than the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is required and the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of the assets and liabilities in the same manner performed in a purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the goodwill is then compared to its carrying amount to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
we completed our review of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
effective october  and have determined that our recorded goodwill is not impaired 
deferred taxes on income income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the periods the temporary differences are expected to be settled 
a valuation allowance is established  as needed  to reduce net deferred tax assets to realizable value 
a valuation allowance has not been established for our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not  they will be realized 
financial instruments we use interest rate swap agreements to manage and reduce risk related to interest payments on our debt instruments 
we recognize all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities and measure them at fair value 
all derivative financial instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and  accordingly  the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
overview of financial results total revenue for increased to million from revenue of million 
net income in was million  or per diluted common share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted common share in revenues the following table shows our revenue sources by product line for the periods indicated

in the years ended december   and  equipment rental revenue totaled million  million and million  supplies sales totaled million  million and million and support services revenue totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we consider these types of revenue to be recurring because they typically are derived from equipment rentals subject to multi year contracts and from supplies sales and support services  which are a natural consequence of the use of our installed base of equipment 
although the initial term of our rental contracts are generally three years  they typically provide a continuing stream of revenue resulting from automatic renewal options or new rental contracts for replacement equipment 
historically  our recurring revenue has consistently been approximately of total revenue 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our recurring revenue will continue at these rates 
we believe this information is useful because it indicates our ability to generate a consistent revenue base

prior to the distribution  sales to pitney bowes canada were primarily accounted for as intercompany sales at cost 
excluding the impact of sales to pitney bowes canada  revenue declined versus we believe the revenue comparison excluding sales to pitney bowes canada eliminates any changes in revenue resulting from the different accounting treatment of sales to pitney bowes canada in and reflects a more meaningful comparison of our revenue performance 
equipment and supplies sales revenue of million increased in from million in excluding the impact of sales to pitney bowes canada  sales revenue declined compared with the prior year

rental revenue derived from our copier product line increased reflecting growth in the overall installed rental population as well as the impact of increased placements of our high end copiers and mfps 
rental revenue from our facsimile product line decreased versus the prior year resulting from lower pricing and a lower installed base 
support services revenue  primarily derived from stand alone service contracts  increased to million in from million in  reflecting the combination of higher contract pricing associated with the increased placement of high end digital products in the united states and increased facsimile placements in the united kingdom 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in compared with million in and as a percentage of sales revenue declined to in from in this decline resulted from lower product costs and lower provision for obsolete inventory  partially offset by the impact of equipment sales to pitney bowes canada under the reseller agreement and an increase in the mix of copier equipment and mfps  which have a higher cost of sales percentage than facsimile sales 
the provision to write our inventory down to net realizable value declined million to million in from million in cost of rentals 
cost of rentals was million in compared with million in and as a percentage of rental revenue declined to in from in this decline resulted from the impact of our disciplined focus on improving profit margins coupled with product cost improvements  partially offset by an increase in the mix of copier and multifunctional product rentals which have a higher cost as a percentage of rental revenue than facsimile machines 
selling  service and administrative expenses 
selling  service and administrative expenses of million were of total revenue in compared with million or of total revenue in selling  service and administrative expenses increased over the prior year resulting from increased finance and administration costs associated with becoming an independent public company million and advertising expenditures associated with our brand awareness campaign million  partially offset by the impact of fewer employees million and lower bad debt write offs million 
purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs and other distribution costs are included in selling  service and administrative costs because no meaningful allocation of these expenses to cost of sales or cost of rentals is practicable

years ended december  and december  revenue 
in  total revenue of million declined versus the prior year total revenue of million  reflecting lower sales and support service revenue  partially offset by increased rental revenue 
equipment and supplies sales revenue of million declined in from million in due to lower copier and facsimile equipment sales and lower supply sales 
the decline in copier equipment sales reflects the shift in our copier marketing focus toward national accounts  which emphasizes equipment rentals as opposed to equipment sales 
the decline in facsimile equipment sales reflects both volume and price declines 
lower supply sales reflects declining facsimile usage caused by the use of other new technologies  such as e mail  as well as lower prices associated with our environmentally friendly eco toner cartridges 
equipment rental revenue of million increased in from million in  reflecting the shift in our copier marketing focus to national accounts  which require a rental placement strategy similar to that of our facsimile product placement strategy 
we continued to implement this strategic shift in our copier systems product line by increasing the focus on renting our copiers  responding to a need for financing flexibility in the major account marketplace 
during  rental revenue derived from our copier product line increased reflecting growth in the overall installed rental population as well as the impact of increased placements of our high end digital products 
rental revenue from our facsimile product line declined versus the prior year 
support services revenue of million  primarily derived from stand alone service contracts  decreased in from million in  reflecting the strategic decision to focus on renting  which includes service  rather than on selling our copier and mfps with associated service contracts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million in compared with million in and as a percentage of sales revenue increased to in from in this increase resulted from million of inventory provisions to write down to market the carrying value of a our analog copier and related parts inventory in response to the continuing market shift from analog to digital copiers  b our service parts inventory to reflect quantities on hand in excess of projected usage and c our sales demonstration equipment which devalues with age 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in our product costs from suppliers located in japan  reflecting the weakening of the yen against the dollar in cost of rentals 
cost of rentals was million in compared with million in and as a percentage of rental revenue increased to in from in  reflecting the impact of lower industry wide pricing on new rental additions and contract renewals 
selling  service and administrative expenses 
selling  service and administrative expenses of million were of total revenue in compared with million or of total revenue in selling  service and administrative expenses increased over the prior year 
the increase reflects higher costs associated with the geographic expansion of sales and service capabilities million  higher finance and administrative costs associated with becoming an independent public company million  higher operating costs associated with our investment in our erp project million  higher warehousing and distribution costs million and higher employee benefit costs million 
we also recorded higher severance costs of million associated with reducing our staffing overhead and administrative costs and increased our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in response to the weaker economic environment and a higher delinquency rate resulting in incremental accounts receivable write offs of million 
purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs and other distribution costs are included in selling  service and administration costs because no meaningful allocation of these expenses to cost of sales or cost of rentals is practicable 
these costs amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in selling  service and administrative expenses are allocated amounts from pitney bowes  reflecting our share of overhead costs related to shared selling  service and administrative expenses

expansion of sales and service capabilities during and  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of ten independent dealers for sales and service capabilities in remote geographic areas 
these acquisitions  individually or in the aggregate  were not significant to our financial position or results of operations 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price  including direct costs of the acquisitions  was allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the operating results of these acquisitions are included in our financial statements from the date of the respective acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources on november  we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders the credit agreement that provided for secured borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed million  comprised of a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a million term loan the term loan 
the term of the revolving credit facility is five years and the term of the term loan is six years 
our credit agreement has a rating of ba from moody s investor services and a bb rating from standard poor s 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets plus of the stock of our subsidiary as security for our obligations under the credit agreement 
available borrowings and letter of credit issuance under the revolving credit facility are determined by a borrowing base consisting of a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable  inventory  rental assets and accrued and advance billings  less outstanding borrowings under the term loan 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and a maximum leverage ratio total debt to ebitda  as well as other covenants  which  among other things  place limits on dividend payments and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement allowed us to originally repurchase up to million of our stock and to make acquisitions up to an aggregate consideration of million 
at december  and  we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
originally  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bore interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the libor rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio 
amounts borrowed under the term loan bore interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the libor rate plus a margin of or  depending on our leverage ratio  or the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of to  depending on our leverage ratio 
a commitment fee of from to on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly  in arrears  depending on our leverage ratio 
on march   the credit agreement was amended to increase the total amount of our stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million 
on july   the credit agreement was further amended to increase the total amount of our stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million and to reduce the term loan interest rates to libor plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio  or to the fleet bank base lending rate plus a margin of from to  depending on our leverage ratio 
on march   the credit agreement was further amended to increase the total amount of stock permitted to be repurchased from million to million  to reduce the minimum ebitda covenant to million for the remainder of the term of the credit agreement and to revise the limitation on capital expenditures 
the credit agreement requires us to manage our interest rate risk with respect to at least of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan for a period of at least months 
accordingly  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements in the notional amounts of million and million expiring in february to convert the variable interest rate payable on the term loan to a fixed interest rate in order to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
these interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges 
the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major international financial institutions 
we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and do not anticipate any losses as a result of counterparty nonperformance 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we will receive payments based upon the day libor rate and remit payments based upon a fixed rate 
the fixed interest rates are and for the million and the million swap agreements  respectively 
our initial borrowings of million under the credit agreement  consisting of million under the term loan and million under the revolving credit facility  were used to repay amounts due to pitney bowes and to pay a dividend to pitney bowes 
at december   pitney bowes credit corporation pbcc provided substantially all of our term loan 
during  pbcc disposed of its commitments under the credit agreement and is no longer a participant in the credit agreement 
during the third quarter of  we revised our cash flow estimates and prepaid million of the amount outstanding under the term loan 
this prepayment was covered by a portion of the million interest rate swap agreement that had been designated as a cash flow hedge 
since it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transactions related to the million term loan prepayment will occur  we recognized a loss related to that portion of the swap agreement underlying the amount of the prepayment by reclassifying million from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense 
we also unwound million of the million interest rate swap agreement 
at december   two interest rate swap agreements in the notional amounts of million and million were outstanding  the aggregate fair value of which was an obligation of million 
this obligation is reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the unrealized loss relating to the outstanding swap agreements was included in other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
the interest rate swap agreements were effective in at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement  consisting solely of borrowings under the term loan and the borrowing base amounted to approximately million 
the term loan is payable in consecutive equal quarterly installments of million due march  through december   three consecutive equal quarterly installments of million due march  through september  and a final payment of million due at maturity 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement  consisting of million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million of borrowings under the term loan  and the borrowing base amounted to approximately million 
as of february   million of borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement  consisting solely of million of borrowings under the term loan and the borrowing base amounted to approximately million 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement was approximately and during and  respectively  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities declined to to at december  compared to to at december  due to reductions in accounts receivable and inventory and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
at december   our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization declined to from at december  due to debt repayments offset in part by stock repurchases 
historically  our cash flow has been positive 
we expect our cash flow to remain positive although we do expect our cash generation to moderate as our ability to continue to provide cash through changes in working capital is reduced 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and provisions for bad debt and inventory obsolescence in the aggregate provided cash of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the provision for bad debt of million in was significantly higher than historical levels reflecting an increase in the rate of delinquencies 
in and the provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory amounted to million and million  respectively  and was higher than historical levels to recognize the impact of the continuing market shift from analog to digital equipment on the market value of our inventory 
changes in the principal components of working capital provided cash of million and million in and  respectively and resulted in a usage of cash of million in of the million of cash provided by working capital changes in  approximately million was due to improved collection results 
in addition  approximately million resulted from the accrual in our accounts of costs that had been included in amounts due to pitney bowes prior to the distribution and included million in income taxes  million in employee medical and benefit costs and million of higher accrual levels for administrative costs associated with becoming and independent public company 
in addition  approximately million of the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted from costs associated with the erp project 
we used million  million and million in investing activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investment in rental equipment assets totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the lower level of rental equipment expenditures in primarily reflects lower product costs 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investment in our erp system accounted for million and million of the capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment for and  respectively 
in and  other investing activities consisted of the acquisition of independent dealers to expand our sales and service capabilities as described above 
cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities in reflects repayments of million under the revolving credit facility and million under the term loan and the repurchase of million shares of our stock at a cost of million 
in march  the board of directors approved a million stock buy back program 
in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our stock  raising the total authorization to million 
currently  we intend to continue repurchasing our stock 
in  cash used in financing activities reflects advances to pitney bowes offset by increases in amounts due to pitney bowes for corporate allocations and other intercompany charges  as well as borrowings of million under the term loan and net borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility 
in  we used borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility to repay amounts due to pitney bowes and to pay a dividend to pitney bowes 
cash used in financing activities in reflects advances to pitney bowes offset by increases in amounts due to pitney bowes for corporate allocations and other intercompany charges 
the following table depicts our future payments under material contractual obligations payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt operating leases long term debt payments are related to the credit agreement 
payments under operating leases relate to the lease and sub lease of properties including sales and service offices under long term lease agreements with initial terms extending from three to fifteen years as described in properties located in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
we have no material commitments other than supply agreements with vendors that extend only to equipment ordered under purchase orders  there are no long term purchase requirements 
we do not have any capital leases or off balance sheet arrangements to finance our business 
we will continue to make additional investments in facilities  rental equipment  computer equipment and systems and our distribution network as required to support our revenue growth 
we anticipate investments in rental equipment assets for new and replacement programs in amounts consistent with prior years 
we estimate that we will invest approximately million to million over the next months to enhance our information systems infrastructure and implement our erp system 
in connection with the distribution  we entered into certain agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to indemnify pitney bowes with respect to certain matters 
we agreed to assume all liabilities associated with our business  and to indemnify pitney bowes for all claims relating to our business 
these may be claims by or against pitney bowes or us relating to  among other things  contractual rights under vendor  insurance or other contracts  trademark  patent and other intellectual property rights  equipment  service or payment disputes with customers and disputes with employees 
we and pitney bowes entered into a tax separation agreement  which governs our and pitney bowes respective rights  responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for the periods ending on or before the distribution 
in addition  the tax separation agreement generally obligates us not to enter into any transaction that would adversely affect the tax free nature of the distribution for the two year period following the distribution  and obligates us to indemnify pitney bowes and affiliates to the extent that any action we take or fail to take gives rise to a tax liability with respect to the distribution 
in each of these circumstances  payment by us is contingent on pitney bowes making a claim 
as such  it is not possible to predict the maximum potential future payments under these agreements 
as of december   we had not paid any amounts to pitney bowes pursuant to the above indemnifications 
however  we have paid amounts to defend and resolve claims and litigation related to our business that we assumed as part of the spin off 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  such loss would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under the credit agreement  are expected to adequately finance our operating cash requirements and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we expect to fund further expansion and long term growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and possible future sales of additional equity or debt securities 
risk factors that could cause results to vary risk factors relating to separating our company from pitney bowes we have a limited history operating as an independent entity and may be unable to make the changes necessary to operate successfully as a stand alone entity  or may incur greater costs as a stand alone entity that may cause our profitability to decline 
prior to the distribution  our business was operated by pitney bowes as a division of its broader corporate organization  rather than as a separate stand alone entity 
pitney bowes assisted us by providing corporate functions such as legal  tax and information technology functions 
following the distribution  pitney bowes has no obligation to provide assistance to us other than certain interim and transitional services to be provided by pitney bowes 
because our business had not previously been operated as a stand alone entity  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement the changes necessary to operate independently or will not incur additional costs as a result of operating independently 
we are implementing an erp system intended to replace the information technology it services provided by pitney bowes under the transition services agreement 
due to unanticipated delays in implementation of phase ii of the erp system  we and pitney bowes have agreed to an extension until june  or  upon our request  december   of the transition services agreement as it relates to it related services 
in january  we received a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service indicating that the extension of the transition services agreement as it relates to it services  through december  will not affect the tax free nature of the spin off 
any failure to implement the critical erp applications appropriately by the given extension date would have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
pitney bowes has been and is expected to continue to be a significant customer 
in and  revenues from pitney bowes  exclusive of equipment sales to pbcc for lease to the end user  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
however  no assurance can be given that pitney bowes will continue to purchase our products and services 
in connection with the distribution  imagistics and pitney bowes entered into a non exclusive intellectual property agreement that allows us to operate under the pitney bowes brand name for a term of up to two years after the distribution 
however  this agreement may be terminated if we or pitney bowes elect to terminate the non competition obligations contained in the distribution agreement 
in  we began introducing new products under the imagistics brand name and we initiated a major brand awareness advertising campaign to establish our new brand name 
brand name recognition is an important part of our overall business strategy and we cannot assure you that customers will maintain the same level of interest in our products when we can no longer use the pitney bowes brand name 
risk factors relating to our business the document imaging and management industry is undergoing an evolution in product offerings  moving toward the use of digital and color technology in a multifunctional office environment 
our continued success will depend to a great extent on our ability to respond to this rapidly changing environment by developing new options and document imaging solutions for our customers 
the proliferation of e mail  multifunctional products and other technologies in the workplace may lead to a reduction in the use of traditional copiers and fax machines 
we cannot anticipate whether other technological advancements will substantially minimize the need for our products in the future 
many of our rental customers have contract provisions allowing for technology and product upgrades during the term of their contract 
if we have priced these upgrades improperly  this may have an adverse effect on our profitability and future business 
if many of our customers exercise their contractual rights to upgrade to digital equipment  we may experience returns of a large number of analog machines and a subsequent loss of book value on these machines 
the document imaging solutions industry is very competitive  we may be unable to compete favorably  causing us to lose sales to our competitors 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to deliver enhanced products  service packages and business processes such as e commerce capabilities  while also offering competitive price levels 
we rely on outside suppliers to manufacture the products that we distribute  many of whom are located in the far east 
in addition  one manufacturer supplies a significant portion of our new copier and multifunctional equipment 
if this manufacturer discontinues its products or is unable to deliver us products in the future or if political changes  economic disruptions or natural disasters occur where its production facilities are located  we will be forced to identify an alternative supplier or suppliers for the affected product 
although we are confident that we can identify alternate sources of supply  we may not be successful in doing so 
even if we are successful  the replacement product may be more expensive or may lack certain features of the discontinued product and we will experience some delay in obtaining the product 
other events that disrupt the shipment to or receipt of ocean freight at us ports  such as labor unrest  war or terrorist activity could delay  prevent or add substantial cost to the company s receipt of such products 
any of these events would cause disruption to our customers and could have an adverse effect on our business 
inflation inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the ways companies operate 
although the cost of copier  facsimile and multifunctional equipment has been declining for the last two years  inflation increases labor costs and operating expenses and may  in the future  raise costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
in addition to inflation pressures  industry wide pricing pressures have negatively impacted our profit margins 
despite these growing costs and industry wide pricing pressures  we have generally been able to partially offset declining profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements and control of operating expense levels 
foreign currency much of our international business is transacted in local currency 
approximately and of our total product purchases  based on costs  were denominated in yen in and our margins were negatively impacted in because the strong japanese yen resulted in higher product costs on yen denominated purchases from our japanese vendors 
our margins were positively impacted in as the weak japanese yen resulted in lower product costs on yen denominated purchases from our japanese vendors 
in  the value of the yen increased approximately against the us dollar while in  the value of the yen declined approximately against the u 
s 
dollar 
we do not currently utilize any form of derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risk 
we manage our foreign exchange risk by attempting to pass through to our customers any cost increases related to foreign currency exchange 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful in passing cost increases through to our customers in the future 
legal matters in connection with the distribution  we agreed to assume all liabilities associated with our business  and to indemnify pitney bowes for all claims relating to our business 
in the course of normal business  pitney bowes has been party to occasional lawsuits relating to our business 
these may involve litigation by or against pitney bowes or imagistics relating to  among other things  contractual rights under vendor  insurance or other contracts  intellectual property or patent rights  equipment  service or payment disputes with customers and disputes with employees 
on october   imagetec lp  imagetec  a dealer of copiers  printers and fax machines located in mchenry  illinois  filed suit against us in the united states district court  northern district of illinois for unfair competition under the lanham act and illinois common law 
the suit alleges that our trademark is confusingly similar with imagetec s federally registered trademarks and creates a likelihood of confusion with imagetec s marks 
the suit seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an unspecified amount  including treble damages for alleged willful and deliberate conduct 
we believe that the plaintiff s complaint is without merit and we intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously 
in connection with the distribution  liabilities were transferred to us for matters where pitney bowes was a plaintiff or a defendant in lawsuits  relating to our business or products 
we have not recorded liabilities for loss contingencies since the ultimate resolutions of the legal matters cannot be determined and a minimum cost or amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
in our opinion  none of these proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  should have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local laws intended to protect the environment 
we believe that  as a general matter  our policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent the risk of environmental damage and financial liability to the company
