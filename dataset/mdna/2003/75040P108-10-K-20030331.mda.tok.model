table of contents part i item business overview we were founded in and are the seventh largest radio broadcasting company in the united states 
we are also the largest radio broadcasting company in the united states primarily targeting african americans 
we own and or operate radio stations in markets 
thirty six of these stations fm and am are in of the top african american radio markets 
we also program five channels on the xm satellite radio system 
our strategy is to expand within our existing markets and into new markets that have a significant african american presence 
we believe radio broadcasting primarily targeting african americans has significant growth potential 
we also believe that we have a competitive advantage in the african american market and the radio industry in general  due to our primary focus on urban formats  our skill in programming and marketing these formats  and our turnaround expertise 
radio one is led by our chairperson and co founder  catherine l 
hughes  and her son  alfred c 
liggins  iii  our chief executive officer and president  who together have over years of operating experience in radio broadcasting 
ms 
hughes  mr 
liggins and our strong management team have successfully implemented a strategy of acquiring and turning around underperforming radio stations 
we believe that we are well positioned to apply our proven operating strategies to our portfolio of radio stations as  in our estimation  approximately two thirds of our stations are not mature and have some form of upside potential remaining 
we will also apply these same strategies to other radio stations in existing and new markets as attractive acquisition opportunities arise 
significant and recent events whta fm atlanta acquisition in april  we completed the acquisition of the assets of whta fm formerly wpez fm  licensed to hampton  georgia  from us broadcasting limited partnership for approximately million 
we had been operating the station under a local marketing agreement since september of wrnb fm dayton acquisition in march  we entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of hawes saunders broadcast properties  inc  owner and operator of wrnb fm formerly wrou fm licensed to west carrollton  ohio  for approximately million in cash 
wrnb fm had been a primary competitor of one of our other stations in the dayton market 
we began operating the station under a local marketing agreement in march this acquisition increases the number of stations that we own and or operate in the dayton market to five 
we anticipate completing this acquisition during the second quarter of cable television joint venture in january  we signed a non binding term sheet with comcast corporation providing for a joint venture to launch a cable television network featuring entertainment  news  opinion and sports related programming targeted primarily towards year old african american viewers 
we expect to make a cash investment  of approximately million  and to provide advertising and management services to the network 

table of contents our stations and markets we operate in many of the largest african american markets 
the table below provides information about our radio stations and the markets in which we operate 
audience share rank is determined by using a combination of african american listenership above a certain threshold in a given market and the average quarter hour share rating for that station 
audience share data are for the demographic and derived from the arbitron survey four book averages ending with the fall arbitron survey 
in the miami market  we provide no audience share data because we do not subscribe to the arbitron service for our station  which is programmed in a non urban format

in addition  the african american consumer tends to have a different consumption profile than non african americans 
an annual report published by target market news provides a list of products and services for which african american households spent more than white households 
in the most recent such annual report  there were dozens of such products and services listed in categories such as apparel and accessories  books  cars and trucks  consumer electronics  food  personal care products  telephone service and transportation 
source the report on the buying power of black america  target market news 
growth in advertising targeting the african american market 
we believe that large corporate advertisers are becoming more focused on reaching minority consumers in the united states 
the african american community is considered an emerging growth market within the mature domestic market 
it is estimated that major national advertisers spent over billion on advertising that targets african american consumers in  up from million in source target market news  
we believe that many large corporations are expanding their commitment to ethnic advertising 
growing influence of african american culture 
we believe that there continues to be an ongoing urbanization of many facets of american society as evidenced by the influence of african american culture in the areas of music for example  hip hop and rap music  film  fashion  sports and urban oriented television shows and networks 
we believe that many companies from a broad range of industries and prominent fashion designers have embraced this urbanization trend in their products  as well as their advertising messages 
growing popularity of radio formats primarily targeting african americans 
we believe that urban programming has been expanded to target a more diverse urban listener base and has become more popular with listeners and advertisers over the past ten years

relative to radio broadcasters targeting a broader audience  we believe we can cover the various segments of our target market with fewer programming formats and therefore fewer radio stations than the maximum per market allowed by the fcc

source arbitron black radio today and arbitron radio today  
we believe that african american radio listeners exhibit greater loyalty to radio stations that target the african american community because those radio stations become a valuable source of entertainment and information responsive to the community s interests and lifestyles 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy includes acquiring and turning around underperforming radio stations principally in the top african american markets 
we also seek to make acquisitions in existing markets where expanded coverage is desirable and in new markets where we believe it is advantageous to establish a presence 
for strategic reasons  or as a result of an acquisition of multiple stations in a market  we may also acquire and operate stations with formats that primarily target non african american segments of the population

through our national presence we also provide advertisers with a radio station advertising platform that is a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to african americans 
the success of our strategy relies on the following market research  targeted programming and marketing  strong management and performance based incentives  radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling  strategic sales efforts  marketing platform to national advertisers  advertising partnerships and special events  and significant community involvement 
market research  targeted programming and marketing we use market research to tailor the programming  marketing and promotions of our radio stations to maximize audience share 
we also use our research to reinforce our current programming and to identify unserved or underserved markets or segments of the african american community in current and new markets and to determine whether to acquire a new radio station or reprogram one of our existing radio stations to target those markets or segments 
we also seek to reinforce our targeted programming by creating a distinct and marketable identity for each of our radio stations 
to achieve this objective  in addition to our significant community involvement discussed below  we employ and promote distinct  high profile on air personalities at many of our radio stations  many of whom have strong ties to the african american community 
strong management and performance based incentives we focus on hiring highly motivated and talented individuals in each functional area of our organization who can effectively help us implement our growth and operating strategies 
our management team is comprised 
table of contents of a diverse group of individuals who bring expertise to their respective functional areas 
we seek to hire and promote individuals with significant potential  the ability to operate with high levels of autonomy and the appropriate team orientation that will enable them to pursue their careers within radio one 
to enhance the quality of our management in the areas of sales and programming  general managers  sales managers and program directors have significant portions of their compensation tied to the achievement of certain performance goals 
general managers compensation is based partially on achieving station operating income benchmarks  which creates an incentive for management to focus on both sales growth and expense control 
additionally  sales managers and sales personnel have incentive packages based on sales goals  and program directors and on air talent have incentive packages focused on maximizing ratings in specific target segments 
radio station clustering  programming segmentation and sales bundling we strive to build clusters of radio stations in our markets  with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the african american population 
this clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration into each segment of our target market 
we are then able to offer advertisers multiple audiences and to bundle the radio stations for advertising sales purposes when advantageous 
we believe there are several potential benefits that result from operating multiple radio stations in the same market 
first  each additional radio station in a market provides us with a larger percentage of the prime advertising time available for sale within that market 
second  the more stations we program  the greater the market share we can achieve in our target demographic groups through the use of segmented programming 
third  we are often able to consolidate sales  promotional  technical support and business functions to produce substantial cost savings 
finally  the purchase of additional radio stations in an existing market allows us to take advantage of our market expertise and existing relationships with advertisers 
strategic sales efforts radio one has assembled an effective  highly trained sales staff responsible for converting audience share into revenue 
we operate with a focused  sales oriented culture which rewards aggressive selling efforts through a generous commission and bonus compensation structure 
we hire and deploy large teams of sales professionals for each of our stations or station clusters  and we provide these teams with the resources necessary to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate 
we utilize various sales strategies to sell and market our stations as stand alones  in combination with other stations within a given market and across markets  where appropriate 
marketing platform to national advertisers through our acquisitions  we have created a national platform of radio stations in some of the largest african american markets 
this platform reaches over million listeners weekly  more than any other media vehicle primarily targeting african americans 
thus  national advertisers find advertising on all our radio stations an efficient and cost effective way to reach this target audience 
through our corporate sales department we bundle and sell this national platform of radio stations to national advertisers thereby enhancing our revenue generating opportunities  expanding our base of advertisers  creating greater demand for our advertising time inventory and increasing the capacity utilization of our inventory and making our sales effort more efficient 
advertising partnerships and special events we believe that in order to create advertising loyalty  we must strive to be the recognized expert in marketing to the african american consumer in the markets in which we operate 
we believe that we have achieved this recognition by focusing on serving the african american consumer and by creating innovative advertising campaigns and promotional tie ins with our advertising clients and sponsoring numerous 
table of contents entertainment events each year 
in these events  advertisers buy signage  booth space and broadcast promotions to sell a variety of goods and services to african american consumers 
as we expand our presence in our existing markets and into new markets  we plan to increase the number of events and the number of markets in which we host these major events 
significant community involvement we believe our active involvement and significant relationships in the african american community provide a competitive advantage in targeting african american audiences 
in this way  we believe our proactive involvement in the african american community in each of our markets significantly improves the marketability of our radio broadcast time to advertisers who are targeting such communities 
we believe that a radio station s image should reflect the lifestyle and viewpoints of the target demographic group it serves 
due to our fundamental understanding of the african american community  we believe we are able to identify music and musical styles  as well as political and social trends and issues  early in their evolution 
this understanding is then integrated into all aspects of our operations and enables us to create enhanced awareness and name recognition in the marketplace 
in addition  we believe our multi level approach to community involvement leads to increased effectiveness in developing and updating our programming formats 
we believe our enhanced awareness and more effective programming formats lead to greater listenership and higher ratings over the long term 
turnaround expertise many of the stations we have acquired have been  in our opinion  underperforming 
by implementing our operating strategy  we have succeeded in increasing the ratings  net broadcast revenue and station operating income of many of the fm stations we have owned and or operated 
we have achieved these improvements while  in many instances  competing against larger media companies 
our turnaround strategy has been especially successful with respect to our operations in atlanta  detroit  los angeles  richmond  boston  raleigh  cincinnati and minneapolis

table of contents advertising revenue substantially all of our net broadcast revenue is generated from the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
additional net broadcast revenue is generated from network compensation payments and other miscellaneous transactions 
local sales are made by the sales staffs located in our markets 
national sales are made by firms specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission from radio one that is based on a percentage of our net broadcast revenue from the advertising obtained 
approximately of our net broadcast revenue for the year ended december  was generated from the sale of local advertising and from sales to national advertisers  including network advertising 
the balance of net broadcast revenue is derived from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to radio one sponsored events and other revenue 
we believe that advertisers can reach the african american community more cost effectively through radio broadcasting than through newspapers or television 
advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on a radio station s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours 
a radio station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to a radio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station 
each radio station s ratings are used by its advertisers to consider advertising with the radio station  and are used by us to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
strategic diversification we continue to explore opportunities in other forms of media that are complementary to our core radio business which will allow us to leverage our expertise in marketing to african americans and our significant listener base 
such opportunities could include an urban oriented radio network  outdoor advertising in urban environments  music production  publishing and other related businesses 
to that end we currently have investments in ibiquity digital corporation  a leading developer of in band on channel digital broadcast technology  pne media holdings  llc  a privately held outdoor advertising company with a presence in several of the markets in which we own radio stations pne subsequently sold most of its assets to nextmedia group  inc and currently holds an approximate ownership interest in nextmedia  quetzal jp morgan partners  quetzal jp  an entity formed for the purpose of investing in minority owned telecommunications entities 
in january  we signed a non binding term sheet with comcast corporation providing for a joint venture to launch a cable television network featuring entertainment  news  opinion and sports related programming targeted primarily towards year old african american viewers 
we expect to make a cash investment of approximately million  and to provide advertising and management services to the network 
competition the radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive 
radio one s stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as television  the internet  newspapers  
table of contents direct mail and outdoor advertising  some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies 
audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net broadcast revenue in that market 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
other radio companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter markets where we operate 
although we believe our stations are well positioned to compete  we cannot assure you that our stations will maintain or increase their current ratings or advertising revenue 
the radio broadcasting industry is also subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
several new media technologies have been or are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers both landline and wireless and other digital audio broadcast formats  satellite digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of two new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous channels and sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which has resulted in additional non commercial fm radio broadcast outlets that are designed to serve localized areas 
we are party to a programming agreement with xm satellite radio inc  a satellite digital audio radio service and have also invested in ibiquity digital corporation  a developer of digital audio broadcast technology which we are using in several of our markets 
however  we cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
we also cannot assure you that we will continue to have the resources to acquire other new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with other new technologies 
antitrust regulation an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional radio stations 
the agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws  the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice  may investigate certain acquisitions 
after the passage of the telecommunications act of  the department of justice gave increased attention to reviewing proposed acquisitions of radio stations 
the justice department is likely to focus particular attention when the proposed buyer already owns one or more radio stations in the market of the station it is seeking to buy 
the justice department has challenged a number of radio broadcasting transactions 
some of those challenges ultimately resulted in consent decrees requiring  among other things  divestitures of certain stations 
in general  the justice department has more closely scrutinized radio station acquisitions where the involved radio stations account for a significant percentage of local radio advertising revenue 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific department of justice or ftc review of a particular acquisition 
any decision by the department of justice or ftc to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate an acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms 
for an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds  the hart scott rodino act requires the parties to file notification and report forms concerning antitrust issues with the department of justice and the ftc and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition 
if the investigating agency raises substantive issues in connection with a proposed transaction  then the parties frequently engage in negotiations with the investigating agency concerning possible means of addressing those issues  including restructuring the proposed acquisition or divesting assets 
in addition  the investigating agency could file suit in federal court to enjoin the acquisition or to 
table of contents require the divestiture of assets  among other remedies 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hart scott rodino act may be investigated by the department of justice or the ftc under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its increased scrutiny of radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that local marketing agreements  joint sales agreements  time brokerage agreements and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station transfers could violate the hart scott rodino act if such agreements take effect prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act 
furthermore  the department of justice has noted that joint sales agreements may raise antitrust concerns under section of the sherman act and has challenged joint sales agreements in certain locations 
as indicated above  the department of justice also has stated publicly that it has established certain revenue and audience share concentration benchmarks with respect to radio station acquisitions  above which a transaction may receive additional antitrust scrutiny 
however  to date  the department of justice has also investigated transactions that do not meet or exceed these benchmarks and has cleared transactions that do exceed these benchmarks 
similarly  the federal communications commission staff has adopted procedures to review proposed radio broadcasting transactions even if the proposed acquisition otherwise complies with the fcc s ownership limitations 
in particular  the fcc may flag assignment and transfer control applications that raise competitive concerns  and the staff may conduct a public interest analysis  including a competitive analysis of the particular market 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the fcc of programming  technical operations  employment and other business practices 
the fcc regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the communications act of  as amended 
the communications act permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the fcc upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting  determines the particular frequencies  locations  operating power  interference standards and other technical parameters of radio broadcast stations  issues  renews  revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses  imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs  establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation  program content and employment and business practices of radio broadcast stations  and has the power to impose penalties  including monetary forfeitures  for violations of its rules and the communications act 
general 
the communications act prohibits the assignment of an fcc license  or other transfer of control of an fcc licensee  without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant requests for consents to assignments or transfers  and in determining whether to grant or renew a radio broadcast license  the fcc considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee and any proposed licensee  including restrictions on foreign ownership  compliance with fcc media ownership limits and other fcc rules  the character of the licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee  and compliance with the anti drug abuse act of 
table of contents the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and specific fcc rules and policies 
this summary does not purport to be a complete listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations and is qualified in its entirety by the text of the communications act  the fcc s rules  regulations and policies  and the rulings and public notices of the fcc 
you should refer to the communications act and these fcc notices  rules and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
a licensee s failure to comply with the requirements of the communications act or fcc rules and policies may result in the imposition of various sanctions  including admonishment  fines  the grant of a license renewal of less than a full eight year term  the grant of a license or license renewal with conditions or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application  the revocation of an fcc license and or the denial of fcc consent to acquire additional broadcast properties 
congress  the fcc and  in some cases  local jurisdictions  have had under consideration or reconsideration  or may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions 
such matters include or may include changes to the license authorization and renewal process  proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on fcc licensees  proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting including proposals to grant free air time to candidates  and other changes regarding political and non political program content  proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer  wine and other alcoholic beverages  technical and frequency allocation matters  changes in broadcast multiple ownership  foreign ownership  cross ownership and ownership attribution policies  including the definition of the local market for multiple ownership purposes  proposals to allow telephone companies to deliver audio and video programming to homes in their service areas  and proposals to alter provisions of the tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions 
finally  the fcc has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to construct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations 
such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  might be adopted  nor can we predict what other matters might be considered in the future  nor can we judge in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on our business 
fcc license grants and renewals 
in making licensing determinations  the fcc considers an applicant s legal  technical  financial and other qualifications 
the fcc grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and  upon application  may renew them for additional terms 
a station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending 
under the communications act  radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years 

table of contents generally  the fcc renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that the radio station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations  and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the communications act or fcc rules and regulations which  taken together  indicate a pattern of abuse 
after considering these factors  the fcc may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions  including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted 
in addition  the communications act authorizes the filing of petitions to deny a license renewal application during specific periods of time after a renewal application has been filed 
if a substantial and material question of fact concerning a renewal application is raised by a petition to deny  or if for any reason the fcc cannot determine that grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest  convenience and necessity  the fcc will hold an evidentiary hearing on the application 
if as a result of an evidentiary hearing the fcc determines that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements specified above and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction  then the fcc may deny a license renewal application 
only after a license renewal application is denied will the fcc accept and consider competing applications for the vacated frequency 
also  during certain periods when a renewal application is pending  the transferability of the applicant s license may be restricted 
historically  our licenses have been renewed without any conditions or sanctions imposed 
however  there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed  will be renewed for a full term or will be renewed without conditions or sanctions 
types of fcc broadcast licenses 
the fcc classifies each am and fm radio station 
an am radio station operates on either a clear channel  regional channel or local channel 
a clear channel is assigned to serve wide areas  particularly at night 
a regional channel is assigned to serve primarily a principal center of population and the rural areas contiguous to it 
a local channel is assigned for unlimited time operations to serve primarily a community and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it 
there are different classes of am radio stations that operate on these channels 
class a radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area 
class b radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area 
class c radio stations operate unlimited time and are designed to render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference 
class d radio stations operate either daytime  during limited times only  or unlimited time with low nighttime power 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm radio station is located 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm radio station are determined by its class 
in general  commercial fm radio stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c and c 
the fcc has adopted a rule that subjects class c fm stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to class c under certain circumstances 
radio one s licenses 
the following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations 
a broadcast station s market may be different from its community of license 
erp refers to the effective radiated power of an fm radio station 
haat refers to the antenna height above average terrain of an fm radio station 
the coverage of an am radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station s transmitter  less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments 
for fm radio stations  signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the erp of the radio station s antenna and the haat of the radio station s antenna

the communications act requires prior approval of the fcc for the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a corporation or other entity holding a license 
in determining whether to approve an assignment of a radio broadcast license or a transfer of control of a broadcast licensee  the fcc considers  among other things the financial and legal qualifications of the prospective assignee or transferee  including compliance with fcc restrictions on non us citizen or entity ownership and control  compliance with fcc rules  regulations and policies  including rules limiting the common ownership of media properties in a given market  the history of the parties compliance with fcc operating rules  and the character qualifications of the transferee or assignee and the individuals or entities holding attributable interests in them 
to obtain the fcc s prior consent to assign or transfer a broadcast license an appropriate application must be filed with the fcc 
if the application to assign or transfer the license involves a substantial change in ownership or control of the licensee  for example  the transfer or acquisition of more than of the voting stock  the application must be placed on an fcc public notice for a period of days during which petitions to deny the application may be filed 
informal objections may be filed any time until the fcc acts upon the application 
if the fcc grants an assignment or transfer application  days from public notice of the grant to seek reconsideration of that grant 
where action is taken by fcc staff under delegated authority  the fcc has an additional days from the end of the day period to set aside such grant on its own motion 
when ruling on an assignment or transfer application  the fcc is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application 
the communications act permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court in certain instances 

table of contents under the communications act  a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any persons who are not us citizens  whom the communications act and fcc rules refer to as aliens  including any corporation that has more than of its capital stock owned or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  by foreign governments or their representatives  or by non us corporations 
furthermore  the communications act provides that no fcc broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than of its capital stock is owned of record or voted by non us citizens or entities or their representatives  or foreign governments or their representatives or by non us corporations  if the fcc finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license 
these restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations  including partnerships and limited liability companies 
thus  the licenses for our stations could be revoked if more than of our outstanding capital stock is issued to or for the benefit of non us citizens 
the fcc generally applies its broadcast ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual  corporation  partnership or other association or entity  including limited liability companies 
in the case of a corporation holding broadcast licenses  the interests of officers  directors and those who  directly or indirectly hold stock representing five percent or more of the total outstanding votes of a licensee corporation are generally deemed attributable interests 
certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only become attributable with the ownership of or more of the voting stock of the corporation holding broadcast licenses 
to assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or an indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable  the fcc uses a multiplier analysis in which non controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non controlling link in a multi corporation ownership chain 
the fcc treats all partnership or limited liability company membership interests as attributable  except for such interests that under fcc policies are considered insulated from material involvement in the management or operation of the media related activities of the entity 
currently  minority voting interests in corporations where there is a shareholder who owns more than of that corporation s voting stock generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the fcc s equity debt plus or edp rule 
an entity with one or more radio stations in a radio market that enters into a local marketing agreement or a time brokerage agreement with another radio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the fcc s local radio station ownership rules if the brokering station supplies more than of the brokered radio station s weekly broadcast hours 
under the fcc s current policies  debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock that have not yet been exercised  minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder and insulated limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the interest holder is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or company generally do not subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the fcc s equity debt plus or edp rule 
under the edp rule  a major programming supplier or a same market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same market media entity holds debt or equity  or both  in the station that is greater than of the value of the station s total debt plus equity 
for purposes of the edp rule  equity includes all stock  whether voting or nonvoting  and equity held by insulated limited partners or limited liability company members 
debt includes all liabilities  whether long term or short term 
a major programming supplier includes any programming supplier that provides more than of the station s weekly programming hours 
a same market media entity subject to the ownership restrictions applicable to radio stations includes any holder of an attributable interest in a broadcast station or daily newspaper located in the same market as the station  but only if the holder s interest is attributable under an fcc attribution rule other than the edp rule 
the communications act and fcc rules generally restrict ownership  operation or control of  or the common holding of attributable interests in radio broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market  radio broadcast stations and television broadcast stations above certain numerical limits serving the same local market radio television cross ownership  and 
table of contents a radio broadcast station and an english language daily newspaper serving the same local market newspaper broadcast cross ownership 
these rules include specific signal contour overlap standards to determine compliance  and the fcc defined market will not necessarily be the same market used by arbitron  neilsen or other surveys  or for purposes of the hart scott rodino act 
current fcc radio broadcast ownership rules allow one entity to own  control or hold attributable interests in an unlimited number of fm radio stations and am radio stations nationwide 
the communications act and the fcc s rules limit the number of radio broadcast stations in local markets in which a single entity may hold an attributable interest as follows in a radio market with or more commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to eight commercial radio stations  not more than five of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to seven commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with to commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to six commercial radio stations  not more than four of which are in the same service am or fm 
in a radio market with or fewer commercial radio stations  a party may own  operate or control up to five commercial radio stations  not more than three of which are in the same service am or fm  except that a party may not own  operate  or control more than percent of the radio stations in such market 
often radio stations enter into local marketing agreements or time brokerage agreements 
these agreements take various forms 
separately owned and licensed radio stations may agree to function cooperatively in programming  advertising sales and other matters  subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the fcc s rules and policies  including the requirement that the licensee of each radio station maintain independent control over the programming and other operations of its own radio station 
the fcc has held that such agreements do not violate the communications act as long as the licensee of the radio broadcast station that is being substantially programmed by another entity remains ultimately responsible for  and maintains control over  the operation of its radio station  and otherwise ensures the radio station s compliance with applicable fcc rules and policies 
however  a radio broadcast station that brokers time on another radio broadcast station or enters into a time brokerage agreement with a radio broadcast station in the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered radio station for purposes of the fcc s multiple ownership rules if the time brokerage arrangement covers more than of the brokered station s weekly broadcast hours 
radio stations also enter into cooperative arrangements commonly known as joint sales agreements 
while these agreements may take varying forms  under the typical joint sales agreement a station licensee obtains  for a fee  the right to sell substantially all of the commercial advertising on a separately owned and licensed station in the same market 
currently  stations for which another licensee sells time under a joint sales agreement are not deemed by the fcc to be an attributable interest of that licensee and thus  stations have operated under joint sales agreements with very little regulation by  or scrutiny from  the fcc with respect to such agreements 
however  in the context of its review of multiple ownership of radio stations in local markets  the fcc has sought public comment on the relevance of such agreements to its analysis of market concentration  on whether such agreements should be attributed for purposes of the multiple ownership rules  and on the extent to which the fcc should continue to distinguish between joint sales agreements and local marketing and time brokerage agreements in its analyses 

table of contents all of these attribution rules limit the number of radio stations or other media we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we want to sell 
in september  the fcc launched a comprehensive examination of its media ownership rules  including the newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule  the radio television cross ownership rule  and the rules and policies concerning multiple ownership of radio stations in local markets 
it has incorporated into this omnibus review a number of already pending proceedings  including its previously commenced rulemakings concerning the local radio ownership rule and its radio market definition and station counting methodology 
in one of these proceedings initiated in november  the fcc sought public comment on a wide range of matters relating to local radio ownership limits  including the public interest mandate for such limits and the impact of the limits on diversity and competition 
the fcc also invited comments on how it should define local market for purposes of its numerical limits 
the fcc currently uses a complex formula that employs one overlapping contour methodology for defining a radio market and a separate overlapping contour methodology for determining the number of operating commercial radio stations in that market for purposes of determining compliance with the local radio ownership restrictions 
the fcc proposed to consider alternate methods of defining markets  which may reduce the number of radio stations considered to be local 
the fcc will also consider how it should measure the market share of competitors  whether by revenues or audience share  and how market concentration impacts local ownership limits 
the fcc sought comment on whether it should use numerical limits in evaluating market concentration  or whether it should review transactions on a case by case basis 
if the latter  the fcc asked how it should evaluate local marketing agreements  time brokerage agreements and joint sales agreements in the context of analyzing market concentration 
even if a transaction complies with its numerical local ownership limits  the fcc  in recent years  has followed a policy under which it gives public notice of its intention to conduct additional ownership concentration analysis  and solicits public comment on the issue of concentration and its effect on competition and diversity  with respect to certain applications for consent to radio station acquisitions 
under this policy  which the fcc has adopted as an interim policy during the pending media ownership proceeding  the fcc will examine the potential competitive effects of proposed radio station combinations 
where the proposed assignment would give one owner or more  or two owners or more  of the radio advertising revenue share of the relevant arbitron metro market  the application will be marked for further fcc review 
the fcc continues to have discretion to review individual cases that involve what it views as excessive market concentration issues  or that present unusual cross interest relationships  on a case by case basis 
the outcome of the fcc s omnibus media ownership proceeding could affect our business in a number of ways  including  but not limited to  the following if the fcc adopts a more narrow market definition based upon arbitron or other geographic measures  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area 
if the fcc changes its policies with respect to local marketing  time brokerage or joint sales agreements for example  if it should decide to attribute joint sales agreements for multiple ownership purposes  we could be limited in our ability to buy or sell time on certain stations 
in general terms  if the fcc changes the way it defines markets or determines excess market concentration for purposes of the broadcast multiple ownership rules  we could be limited in our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets  in our ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements  and in our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations 
programming and operations 
the communications act and fcc regulations require broadcasters to serve the public interest by presenting programming in response to community problems  needs and interests and maintaining certain records demonstrating its responsiveness 
the fcc will consider complaints from listeners about a broadcast station s programming  and such complaints are required to be placed in a station s 
table of contents public file 
stations also must pay fcc regulatory and application fees  and follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries and technical operation  including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation 
in december  the united states copyright office ruled that broadcasters that simulcast by a process known as streaming their over the air signals on the internet would incur copyright liability for the use of copyrighted materials  including music programming 
in july  the copyright office announced its final rule and order establishing the royalty fees to be charged for streaming radio signals on the internet 
the fees are to apply retroactively to  and to future internet streaming 
in response to the july ruling  america online  inc and a number of internet companies filed suit in the us court of appeals for the us circuit challenging the ruling 
we cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or its effect on our future streaming activity 
internet streaming is not and has not been a material part of our operations 
the fcc s rules prohibit a broadcast licensee from simulcasting more than of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service that is  am am or fm fm 
the simulcasting restriction applies if the licensee owns both radio broadcast stations or owns one and programs the other through a local marketing agreement  and only if the contours of the radio stations overlap in a certain manner 
the fcc requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices 
in november  the fcc adopted new eeo rules  which became effective march   that bar employment discrimination by broadcast stations on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin or gender 
they also require station employment units with at least five full time employees to widely disseminate information about all full time job openings  absent certain limited exceptions  to recruitment sources  including those requesting to be on the job vacancy notification list  so as to reach all segments of the population in the communities served by the employment unit 
in addition  station employment units must undertake a set number of non vacancy specific outreach initiatives normally every two years from an fcc menu of outreach initiatives  including  for example  meaningful participation in job fairs  internships or scholarship programs 
station employment units subject to these recruitment and outreach requirements must retain various records of their efforts and place in their public inspection files  annually  an eeo public file report posting an electronic version on their internet websites 
radio station employment units with more than full time employees generally must file certain of their annual eeo public file reports with the fcc midway through their license term 
the fcc is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part time employment positions 
from time to time  complaints may be filed against radio one s radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules 
in addition  the fcc may conduct audits or inspections to ensure and verify licensee compliance with fcc rules and regulations 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including fines or conditions  the grant of short less than the maximum eight year renewal terms or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license 
employees as of march   we employed approximately  full time employees and part time employees 
our employees are not unionized except for some of our employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements that we assumed in connection with certain of our station acquisitions 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and believe relations with our employees are satisfactory 
in an effort to control broadcast and corporate expenses  we centralize certain radio station functions by market location 
for example  in each of our markets we typically employ one general manager who is responsible for all of our radio stations located in such market

similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies that conducted initial public offerings of their common stock in the late s the issuers 
those cases are now consolidated under the caption in re initial public offering securities litigation  case no 
mc in the amended complaint against radio one  the plaintiffs allege that radio one  certain of its officers and directors  and the underwriters of certain of its public offerings violated section of the securities act of by failing to disclose in its registration statements material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  the underwriters 
the complaint also contains a claim for violation of section b of the securities exchange act of based on allegations that this omission constituted a deceit on investors 
the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
in october  the parties agreed to toll the statute of limitations with respect to radio one s officers and directors until september   and on the basis of this agreement  the officers and directors were dismissed from the lawsuit without prejudice 
in february  the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss the section claims against radio one and almost all of the issuers  and denying the motion to dismiss the section b claims against radio one and many of the issuers 
radio one believes that these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself 
radio one also maintains directors and officers liability insurance that it believes is applicable to this litigation  and radio one believes that it may be entitled to indemnification by the ipo underwriters in the event of an adverse result

table of contents selected other data the following table includes information regarding station operating income  station operating income margin and ebitda 
although these measures of performance are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we believe that these measures are useful to an investor in evaluating radio one because these measures are widely used in the broadcast industry as a measure of a radio broadcasting company s operating performance 
nevertheless  you should not consider station operating income  station operating income margin and ebitda in isolation from or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
moreover  because station operating income  station operating income margin and ebitda are not measures calculated in accordance with gaap  these performance measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
station operating income consists of operating income before depreciation  amortization  corporate expense and non cash compensation 
station operating income margin represents station operating income as a percentage of net revenues

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
introduction our net broadcast revenue is derived primarily from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  tower rental income  independent promotion agreements  ticket and other revenue related to special events we sponsor throughout the year 
our net broadcast revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market 
advertising rates are based primarily on a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by arbitron  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  and the supply of and demand for radio advertising time 
advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours 
in  approximately of our net revenue was generated from local advertising and was generated from national spot advertising  including network advertising 
the balance of revenue was generated from tower rental income  ticket sales and revenue related to our sponsored events and other revenue 
our significant broadcast expenses are i employee salaries and commissions  ii programming expenses  iii advertising and promotion expenses  iv rental of premises for studios  v rental of transmission tower space and vi music license royalty fees 
we strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions such as finance  accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems and the overall programming management function 
we also use our multiple stations  market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies 
we generally incur advertising and promotional expenses to increase our audiences 
however  because arbitron reports ratings quarterly  any changed ratings and therefore the effect on advertising revenues tends to lag behind the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenditures 
depreciation and amortization of costs associated with the acquisition of radio stations and interest carrying charges have historically been significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
however  with the adoption of sfas no 
 the impact of depreciation and amortization was greatly reduced in see liquidity and capital resources impact of recent accounting pronouncements below 
the performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net broadcast revenue  station operating income and ebitda  although station operating income and ebitda are not measures utilized under gaap 
see selected financial data selected other data 
station operating income and ebitda should not be considered in isolation from  nor as substitutes for  operating income  net income  cash flow  or other consolidated income or cash flow statement data computed in accordance with gaap  nor as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
despite their limitations  station operating income and ebitda are widely used in the broadcasting industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  particularly in the case of acquisitions 
we believe that  by eliminating such effects  station operating income provides a meaningful measure of comparative radio station performance  and ebitda provides a meaningful measure of overall company performance after taking into account corporate operating expenses related to the employment of the senior management team and other overhead costs 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or services 
in order to maximize cash revenue from our spot inventory  we minimize the use of trade agreements and have reduced trade revenue to approximately of our gross revenue in  down from approximately in

several factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  that did not affect the prior year 
during the year ended december  we used approximately million of the million in net proceeds from an april equity offering to reduce outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility  which resulted in decreased interest expense during  we discontinued the amortization of fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill effective january   which significantly reduced our amortization expense during  and we included a full year of operating results for radio stations acquired from blue chip broadcasting  inc in august of and two new stations launched in the atlanta market during june and august of fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december net broadcast revenue 
net broadcast revenue increased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  from approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
the increase was the result of broadcast revenue growth in most of our markets in which we have operated for at least one year  as we benefited from historical ratings increases at certain of our radio stations and overall radio industry growth 
in addition  approximately million of this increase was attributable to stations acquired in our august acquisition of blue chip broadcasting  inc and approximately million was associated with two new stations launched in the atlanta market during 
table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  from approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
this increase was related to our expansion within the markets in which we operate  including increased variable costs associated with increased revenue  start up and expansion expenses in our newer markets  and operating expenses associated with acquisitions made during  including expenses of approximately million associated with the stations acquired from blue chip broadcasting  inc in and approximately million associated with two new stations launched in the atlanta market during corporate expenses 
corporate expenses including non cash compensation increased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  from approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
this increase was due primarily to growth in our corporate staff and associated expenses  consistent with our overall expansion 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  from approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
this decrease was due primarily to the adoption of sfas no

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and  to the extent necessary  commitments available under our amended and restated bank credit facility and other debt or equity financing 
we have used  and will continue to use  a significant portion of our capital resources to consummate acquisitions 
these acquisitions were or will be funded from our bank credit facility  the proceeds of the historical offerings of our common stock and preferred stock  the proceeds of future common and or preferred stock  and or debt offerings  and internally generated cash flow 

table of contents we entered into our amended and restated bank credit facility as of july  under the credit facility  we have borrowed million in term loans and may borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
historically  we have drawn down funds from the credit facility as capital was required  primarily for acquisitions 
as of december   we were able to borrow up to approximately million  taking into account the covenant restrictions in effect as of that date 
both the term loan and the revolving commitment under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from 
to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility requires that we comply with certain financial covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt 
such terms also place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  capital expenditures  transactions with affiliates  consolidation and mergers  and the issuance of equity interests  among other things 
the credit facility also requires compliance with financial tests based on financial position and results of operations  including a leverage ratio  an interest coverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  all of which could effectively limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility or to otherwise raise funds in the debt market 
on march   we entered into an amendment with our lenders under our bank facility that modified the financial condition covenants to terms more favorable to us 
we believe that we are in compliance with all the covenants of our credit facility 
in  a minimum principal payment in the amount of million will be due in equal quarterly installments of approximately million 
we expect that we will meet the quarterly debt commitments through one or more of the following cash on hand  cash flow from operations  additional permitted borrowings  or other debt or equity financing 
the following table provides a comparison of our statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended december  and fiscal year ended december  net cash flows from operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash from financing activities net cash flow from operating activities increased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  from approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
this increase was due primarily to an increase in net broadcast revenue  net of an increase in operating expenses and an increase in net cash flows used for working capital purposes 
for the fiscal year ended december   net cash flows from operating activities were driven by an increase in net loss and reduction in accounts payable  more than offset by higher non cash expenses 
net cash flow used in investing activities decreased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
during the fiscal year ended december   we used approximately million to acquire radio station assets and deposited funds in an escrow account for a pending acquisition 
during the fiscal year ended december   we used million of cash to acquire radio stations and to make deposits on pending radio stations acquisitions 
we also received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of seven non core stations that we divested or agreed to divest 

table of contents net cash flows from financing activities decreased to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended december   or 
during the fiscal year ended december   we completed an offering of  shares of class d common stock at an offering price of per share 
through this offering  we received proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
during the fiscal year ended december   we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes and borrowed approximately million under our credit facility 
these proceeds  coupled with cash from operations  were used to redeem our senior subordinated notes which totaled approximately million  to repay approximately million in term loans  to repay approximately million in revolving credit and to fund various acquisitions 
in connection with these borrowings and as a result of amortization expenses related to our senior subordinated notes  we incurred approximately million in deferred debt financing costs 
we continuously review opportunities to acquire additional radio stations  primarily in the top african american markets  and to make strategic investments 
as of the date of this report  other than our pending acquisition of wrnb fm in the dayton market and our agreement in principle to fund a joint venture with comcast corporation approximately million  we have no written or oral understandings  letters of intent or contracts to make acquisitions of additional radio stations or strategic investments 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions and strategic investments will be financed through funds generated from operations  cash on hand  equity financings  permitted debt financings  debt financings through unrestricted subsidiaries or a combination of these sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if available  will be available on favorable terms 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt  and our ability to refinance the senior subordinated notes at or prior to their scheduled maturity date in  will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
in addition to debt service and the dividends related to our preferred stock  our principal liquidity requirements will be for working capital  continued business development  strategic investment opportunities and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
for  capital expenditures are expected to total approximately to million 
management believes that  based on current levels of operations and anticipated internal growth  for the foreseeable future  cash flow from operations together with other available sources of funds will be adequate to make required payments of interest on our indebtedness  to fund our pending acquisition  to pay dividends on our preferred stock  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to enable us to comply with the terms of our debt agreements 
however  in order to finance future acquisitions or investments  if any  we may require additional financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this pronouncement requires a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles will not be amortized into results of operations but  instead  would be reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than their fair value 
we adopted the provisions of this statement  which apply to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets acquired prior to june   effective january  we adopted the provisions of this statement that apply to goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets acquired after june   effective july  the adoption of these accounting standards has eliminated the amortization of goodwill and fcc broadcast licenses commencing january  sfas no 

table of contents has had a material impact on our financial statements  as the amounts previously recorded for the amortization of goodwill and fcc broadcast licenses were significant 
we recorded amortization expense of approximately million for the year ended december   but did not record a similar amortization expense for the year ended december  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
upon adopting the transitional rules of sfas no 
 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  net of an income tax benefit of million in the first quarter of  as the carrying value of certain of our fcc licenses exceeded the appraised fair value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reflected this charge as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  effective january   in our statement of operations 
we adopted the final provision of sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of by reviewing the fair value of its reporting units and comparing that fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit 
in completing the transitional assessment of goodwill  we identified the reporting units  determined the carrying value of each reporting unit  and determined the fair value of each reporting unit 
we had up to six months from the date of the adoption to determine the reporting units in which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of those assets 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeded its fair value  an indication would exist that the reporting unit s goodwill was impaired  and we would then be required to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with statement of financial accounting board standard no 
sfas no 
 business combinations  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
based on this analysis  we determined that we had an impairment of goodwill as defined in sfas no 
in our augusta  georgia market 
we calculated the amount of the impairment and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  net of an income tax benefit of  during the fourth quarter of as the provisions of sfas no 
related to the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are effective as of january   the financial information for the quarter ended march   which preceded the period in which the transitional goodwill impairment loss was measured  has been restated to reflect the accounting change in that quarter

fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
table of contents liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plan as permitted by statement of financial accounting standard no

derivative value changes are recorded in income for any contracts not classified as qualifying cash flow hedges 
for derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships  any change in value is recognized in earnings 
the change in derivative fair value depends on the classification of the derivative as a hedging instrument 
for derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships  the effective portion of the derivative value change must be recorded through other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
our derivative financial instruments as of december  and are accounted for as qualifying cash flow hedges and changes in value are recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
goodwill and fcc licenses we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
prior to january   goodwill and fcc licenses were amortized over a year period excluding the assets acquired from blue chip broadcasting  inc and sinclair telecable  inc commencing january   goodwill and fcc licenses are not amortized  but are tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the amount determined by deducting the estimated fair value of all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if the recorded value of goodwill exceeds its implied value  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements of radio one impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of fcc licenses and goodwill  which are considered indefinite lived assets and are subject to an annual impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill and fcc licenses long lived assets  excluding goodwill and fcc licenses  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is 
table of contents present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying values or fair values  less estimated costs of disposal 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in an agency s ability to meet its financial obligation to radio one  radio one s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due radio one could change by a material amount 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
seasonality seasonal net broadcast revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
radio one s first fiscal quarter generally produces the lowest net broadcast revenue for the year 
capital and commercial commitments the following table and discussion reflect radio one s significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period capital commitments total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases capital expenditure commitments in addition to the obligations above  radio one also has the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments severance obligations  employment contracts  programming contracts  
table of contents dividends on our high tides  interest swap agreements  and other operating contracts 
we anticipate that we will fund such obligations and commitments with cash flow from operations 
if we terminate our interest swap agreements before they expire  we will required to pay early termination fees 
risk factors our future operating results could be adversely affected by a number of risks and uncertainties  certain of which are described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may impair our business operations 
if any of the risks described below actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in the future  we may have difficulty integrating the operations  systems and management of the stations we acquire 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate successfully any operations  systems or management of stations we acquire in the future 
our failure to integrate and manage newly acquired stations successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  in the event that the operations of a new station do not meet our expectations  we may restructure or write off the value of some portion of the assets of the new station 
we face many unpredictable business risks  both general and specific to the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our future operations are subject to many business risks  including those risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  including economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry  shifts in population  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations and other entertainment and communications media  technological changes and innovations  and changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the department of justice  the federal trade commission and the federal communications commission 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot guarantee with any degree of certainty or predict what effect  if any  these variables will have on our future operations 
generally  advertising tends to decline during economic recession or downturn 
consequentially  our advertising revenue is likely to be adversely affected by a recession or downturn in the united states economy  the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate radio stations  or other events or circumstances that adversely affect advertising activity 
the loss of key personnel  including on air talent  could disrupt the management and operations of our business 
our business depends upon the continued efforts  abilities and expertise of our executive officers  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief operating officer and general counsel  and other key 
table of contents employees  including on air personalities 
we believe that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers would be difficult to replace  and that the loss of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on us  including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  our radio stations employ or independently contract with several on air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas 
these on air personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a station  and thus  the ability of the station to sell advertising 
we cannot be assured that these individuals will remain with our radio stations or will retain their audiences 
two common stockholders have a majority voting interest in radio one and have the power to control matters on which radio one s common stockholders may vote  and their interests may conflict with yours 
as of march   catherine l 
hughes and her son  alfred c 
liggins  iii  collectively held approximately of the outstanding voting power of radio one s common stock 
as a result  ms 
hughes and mr 
liggins will control most decisions involving radio one  including transactions involving a change of control of radio one  such as a sale or merger 
in addition  certain covenants in radio one s debt instruments require that ms 
hughes and mr 
liggins maintain specified ownership and voting interests in radio one  and prohibit other parties voting interests from exceeding specified amounts 
ms 
hughes and mr 
liggins have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members of the board of directors 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards which characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies 
several new media technologies are being developed  including the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers and other digital audio broadcast formats  satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of several new satellite radio services with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs  and in band on channel digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services 
we program five channels on a satellite digital audio radio service  and also have invested in a developer of digital audio broadcast technology 
however  we cannot assure you that these arrangements will be successful or enable us to adapt effectively to these new media technologies 
we compete for advertising revenue against radio stations and other media  many of which have greater resources than we do  and if we are unable to maintain or grow our advertising revenue share  our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
in the competitive broadcasting industry  the success of each of our radio stations is primarily dependent upon its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its broadcast area  we cannot be sure that any of our stations can maintain or increase its current audience ratings or market share  or that advertisers will not decrease the amount they spend on advertising 
our advertising revenue may suffer if any of our stations cannot maintain its audience ratings or market share 
shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to 
table of contents lose market share 
our stations also compete for audiences and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations  and some of the owners of those competing stations have greater resources than we do 
if a competing station converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations  or if one of our competitors strengthens its operations  our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue 
other radio companies which are larger and have more resources may also enter markets in which we operate 
in addition  our stations also compete with other media such as broadcast and cable television  newspapers  magazines  direct mail  music videos  the internet and outdoor advertising  some of which may be controlled by horizontally integrated companies 
we also anticipate that our stations will compete with satellite based radio services  including sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio 
we currently program five channels for xm satellite radio 
the terms of our debt restrict us from engaging in many activities and require us to satisfy various financial tests  and these restrictions may make it more difficult to pursue our acquisition strategy 
our bank credit facility and the agreements governing our other outstanding debt  including our senior subordinated notes  contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay cash dividends  purchase our capital stock  make capital expenditures  make investments or other restricted payments  swap or sell assets  engage in transactions with related parties  secure non senior debt with our assets  or merge  consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our bank credit facility requires that we obtain our banks consent for acquisitions that do not meet specific criteria 
these restrictions may make it more difficult to pursue our acquisition strategy 
our bank credit facility also requires that we maintain specific financial ratios  which could be affected by events beyond our control 
the loans under our bank credit facility will be due in august and our senior subordinated notes will be due in july a breach of any of the covenants contained in our bank credit facility could allow our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility to be immediately due and payable and a breach of any of the covenants contained in the indenture covering our senior subordinated notes could allow the holders of those notes to declare the notes immediately due and payable 
in addition  our banks could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
if the amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility or payment of our senior subordinated notes are accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the banks or to our other debt holders 
our substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete 
we have a substantial amount of debt  a portion of which bears interest at variable rates 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect us for various reasons  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt payments or other corporate purposes  have sufficient funds available for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes  compete with competitors that have less debt than we do  and react to changing market conditions  changes in our industry and economic downturns 
our business depends on maintaining our licenses with the fcc 
we could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license 
radio broadcasters depend upon maintaining radio broadcasting licenses issued by the fcc 
these licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years and may be renewed 
our radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times from october  to august  see radio one s licenses above 
although we may apply to renew our fcc licenses  interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications

table of contents addition  if radio one or any of our stockholders  officers  or directors violates the fcc s rules and regulations or the communications act of  as amended  or is convicted of a felony  the fcc may commence a proceeding to impose sanctions upon us 
examples of possible sanctions include the imposition of fines  the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses 
if the fcc were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license  we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after we had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
among other things  the communications act and fcc rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own directly or by attribution in any market and require fcc approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses 
the fcc recently commenced a rulemaking proceeding in which it will examine its rules and policies concerning ownership of multiple radio stations within a local market 
the new rulemaking could lead to significant changes in how the fcc reviews radio station transactions that  according to the fcc  could result in substantial economic concentration and thus raise competition concerns 
the filing of petitions or complaints against radio one or any fcc licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the fcc delaying the grant of  or refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer of control of licenses 
the communications act and fcc rules and policies also impose limitations on non us ownership and voting of the capital stock of radio one 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk both the revolving commitment and term loan borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either libor plus a spread that ranges from 
to or the prime rate plus a spread of up to  depending on our leverage ratio 
under the bank credit facility  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations using interest rate hedge agreements 
we have entered into various fixed rate swap agreements designed to mitigate our exposure to higher floating interest rates 
these swap agreements require that we pay a fixed rate of interest on the notional amount to a bank and that bank pay to us a variable rate equal to three month libor 
as of december   we had swap agreements in place for a total notional amount of million 
the swap agreements range in duration from to months 
our credit exposure under these agreements is limited to the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party  however  we do not anticipate non performance 
all of the swap agreements are tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the valuation of each of these swap agreements is affected by the change in the three month libor rates and the remaining term of the agreement 
any increase in the three month libor rate results in a more favorable valuation  while a decrease in the three month libor rate results in a less favorable valuation
