item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an asp that provides edc and other services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
we assist our customers in accelerating the completion of clinical trials by streamlining the collection of data relating to clinical trials  and improving the overall quality of the clinical trial data collected 

table of contents the discussion that follows highlights our business conditions and certain financial information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
approximately of our assets  or approximately  is held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
since commencing edc operations in  we have experienced some growth in revenue but continue to record significant losses and negative cash flow from operations 
we are continuing to develop and commercialize our business  and anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we use a technology platform that consists of windows compatible software and intranet hardware known as datatrak edc to provide edc and other services to clinical trial sponsors and cros 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of datatrak edc specifically 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercial acceptance of the datatrak process 
our contracts with our customers provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and we recognize revenue as these components or services are delivered 
services provided by us that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as completed 
generally  these contracts range in duration from one to three years 
the ultimate contract value is dependent upon the length of the customer s use of datatrak edc and the services we provide 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  we recognize revenue per the specific terms of each contract 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
our customers  with or without cause  can terminate a contract at any time 
if one of our contracts is cancelled  we are entitled to payment for all work performed through the date of notice of termination and for recovery of some or all costs incurred to terminate a contract 
the termination of a contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs we have previously recognized 
at december   our backlog was  compared to backlog of  at december  the december  backlog included a  contract that was placed on hold by the customer 
at december  this contract has been removed from backlog 
we expect to convert  of our december  backlog into revenue during subsequent to year end  we have added additional contracts to backlog that we expect will generate approximately  of additional revenue 
however  our contracts can be cancelled or delayed at anytime  therefore our backlog  at any point in time  is not an accurate predictor of future levels of revenue 
in the future  we may also record revenue related to the sales and licensing of software 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition  software development costs and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and revenue is recognized as these components or services are delivered 
services we provide that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as services are completed 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  we recognize revenue per the specific terms of each contract 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
pass through costs that are paid directly by our customers  and for which we do not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
the termination of a contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs previously recognized

after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related product

in our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during  and we recorded net operating losses of   and  respectively 
during these years  our revenue has grown from  in to  in to  in revenue growth has been hampered by the slow growth of the edc market 
during the last three years our operating expenses have continued to increase from  in to  in and  in our personnel costs  which have represented approximately to of our operating expenses  have increased from  in to  in and  in during the second half of  we took steps to 
table of contents reduce our annual operating costs  primarily through reductions in personnel costs  by approximately  at our current levels of revenue and conversion of backlog into revenue  we anticipate that our operating loss will be significantly reduced during however  we anticipate that we still may record a net operating loss for the year ended december  the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue direct costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special items depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income  net net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to greater acceptance of our datatrak edc software by clinical trial sponsors  resulting in an increase in the number of clinical trials using the datatrak edc software 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit was  and  during and  respectively 
a  increase in personnel costs during was offset by a decrease in other direct costs 
these other direct costs are mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
we were able to leverage our prior period investments in personnel  in conjunction with our increased revenue to increase gross margin to in compared to in based on our anticipated levels of revenue and our current cost structure  we anticipate that our gross margin in will meet or exceed the levels achieved in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of  caused by an increase in expenses related to sales and marketing  software development and corporate office personnel 
during  we recorded special charges of  included in special items is  of expenses associated with our proposed acquisition of oriam  sa  from which we withdrew in january also  during   of expenses related to the reduction of employees were recorded 
this reduction in employees  along with other decreases in payroll costs that have been implemented are expected to reduce our annual operating costs by approximately  beginning in january depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase was the result of depreciating capital expenditures associated with the development of our information technology infrastructure and amortizing leasehold improvements at our new corporate headquarters 

table of contents other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december  due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs and decreasing interest rates on our short term investments 
due to our loss for the year ended december   no income tax expense was recorded 
at december  we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for united states income tax purposes  which will expire through the year we also had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for german income tax purposes with no expiration date 
due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we have fully provided for our deferred tax assets through a valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  revenue growth was hampered by slower than expected development and conversion of our backlog into revenue during during the second half of  we began reorganizing our sales force in order to attract new business and grow backlog 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit was  and  during and  respectively 
the increase in direct costs was mainly the result of increased personnel costs of  from the addition of new employees 
the increase in personnel costs was partially offset by an  decrease in other direct costs  mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
sg a expenses increased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of  caused by an increase in sales and marketing and software development personnel 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase was the result of depreciating capital expenditures associated with the development of our information technology infrastructure 
other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december   due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs  and decreasing interest rates on our short term investments 
for the year ended december   there was a  decrease in foreign currency transaction adjustments compared to the year ended december  due to our loss for the year ended december   no income tax expense was recorded 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures and purchases and maturities of short term investments 
in january we received approximately  in net proceeds with the completion of our private placement of common shares 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received upon completion of negotiated performance milestones throughout the life of the contract 
we record all amounts received as a liability 
table of contents deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  the increase in accounts receivable was caused by our growth in revenue during deferred revenue increased to  at december  compared to  at december  due to advance payments we have received in conjunction with our increased volume of contracts 
cash and cash equivalents decreased  during the year ended december  this was the result of  used in operating activities  offset by  provided by investing and financing activities 
cash used for operating activities resulted from the funding of net operating losses and other working capital needs 
investing activities included net proceeds of  from purchases and maturities of short term investments offset by  used to purchase property and equipment 
financing activities included  in cash received from our private placement of common shares 
at december   we had working capital of  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  our working capital has decreased by  since december  the decrease was primarily the result of the  decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which we have relied upon to fund operations 
the growth in accounts receivable was offset by the growth in deferred revenue 
changes in other current assets and liabilities caused working capital to decrease by  we are party to two separate lease agreements  which require us to maintain restricted cash balances 
included in our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was  of restricted cash at december  we are responsible for funding the enhancement and testing of the datatrak edc software 
we will continue to invest in the development of the datatrak process 
our operations and the edc market are still in a developmental stage 
we have experienced some revenue growth  however  we anticipate negative cash flow from operations during as we continue to build our customer base  increase our backlog and convert our current backlog into revenue 
we anticipate capital and related expenditures of approximately  for the twelve months ending december  for the continued commercialization and enhancement of datatrak edc  which we expect to fund from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations 
we believe that  with the cost cutting initiatives we have undertaken and continued growth in revenue  our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through december  however  we may need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of contacts  support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 
we have recorded net losses of  in   in and  in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  at december  compared with  at december  our viability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon customer acceptance of edc services  management s ability to raise and or preserve capital and ultimately  a return to profitability 
we expect to generate approximately  of revenue in from our contracts in backlog as of december  subsequent to year end  we have added additional contracts to backlog that we expect will generate approximately  of additional revenue 
this coupled with our staff reductions and other payroll cost savings implemented during the second half of will maintain satisfactory cash reserves during the cost cutting measures we have implemented will reduce our annual expenses by 
table of contents approximately  further  we are attempting to increase our liquidity resources through the sale of special edc software licenses to selected customers and we continue to seek new sources of capital either through selling debt or equity securities 
we believe that our cost cutting efforts in conjunction with our growing backlog and conversion of backlog into revenue will allow us to continue as a going concern and meet our obligations over the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  contractual obligations payments due by period less than after total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations inflation to date  we believe that the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of our revenue was earned in germany by our subsidiary  datatrak gmbh 
we manage our risk to foreign currency exchange rates by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we anticipate will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements 
in addition  words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 

table of contents forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions and risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
we have identified the following important factors  which could cause our actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements contained herein to take into account events or circumstances that occur after the date of this annual report on form k 
in addition  we do not undertake any responsibility to update publicly the occurrence of unanticipated events  which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
we have a limited operating history and we have not had profitable operations 
we began providing edc services in and have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our performance 
we have recognized operating losses in each year since our cumulative operating loss since from edc operations totaled  at december   and we may continue to not be profitable during future periods 
if we do not continue to enhance our software  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers 
although the datatrak edc software has been used in clinical trials  its continued enhancement is necessary to provide additional functionality and services to meet the ever changing needs and expectations of our customers 
among the enhancements we have added to our software are features including electronic signatures  single user login for added security and multiple user access 
to date we have had limited edc revenue from which to support the costs of this continued software enhancement 
our potential future revenue may not be sufficient to absorb corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak process 
our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
we are subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including our success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which we participate  the timing of clinical trial sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors  which could cause our revenue predictions to be incorrect 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
we may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of our relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition 
volatility in our quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
our business strategies are unproven and we are in an early stage of development 
our efforts to establish a standardized edc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of clinical trial sponsors 
the long term viability of our business remains unproven 
our strategy may not gain acceptance among sponsors of clinical research  research sites or investigators 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may lose revenues if we experience delays in clinical trials or if we lose contracts 
although our contracts provide that we are entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  our customers generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or our contract related 
table of contents thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
clinical trial sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
because of our low level of backlog and revenue  we may lose revenues if a clinical trial sponsor decides to delay or terminate a trial in which we participate 
we may lose revenues if any of our customers decrease their research and development expenditures  or if we lose any of our major customers 
our primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
our business depends on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
the extent to which we rely on revenue from one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  our ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials and other factors 
in light of our small revenue base  we are more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the edc industry 
during  three customers accounted for of our total revenue for the year 
our operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn or consolidations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in these industries research and development expenditures or a change in the regulatory environment in which companies in these industries operate 
changes in government regulations relating to the health care industry could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
demand for our services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
none of these proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines and rules related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the datatrak process can be kept in compliance with these guidelines and rules as they develop 
any release of fda guidance that is significantly inconsistent with the design of datatrak edc may cause us to incur substantial costs to remain in compliance with fda guidance and regulations 
we may not be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to compete in the edc market 
the edc market  which is still developing  and must compete with the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  is highly fragmented 
the major competitors  in the edc market  include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
any current and potential future competitors have or may have substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged  thereby gaining market share or product acceptance to our detriment 
we may be subject to liability for potential breaches of contracts or losses relating to the unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our services are supported by telecommunications equipment  software  operating protocols and proprietary applications for high speed transmission of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
in addition  clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research requires the review and handling of large 
table of contents amounts of patient data 
potential liability may arise from a breach of contract or a loss of or unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our financial position could be materially adversely affected if we were forced to undertake the defense of  or were found financially responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks 
we maintain a million errors and omissions professional liability insurance policy to cover claims that may be brought against us 
this coverage may not be adequate  or continue to be available to us  in the future 
our common shares may be delisted if we fail to meet the continued listing requirements of nasdaq 
on february  we received a nasdaq staff determination indicating that the we failed to comply with the minimum million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule a  and that our common shares were subject to delisting from the nasdaq national market 
in response to these developments  we voluntarily elected to file an application with nasdaq to transfer the listing of our common shares from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
our transfer application was accepted and our common shares began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market on march  as a nasdaq smallcap market listed company  we must continue to comply with the continued listing standards of the nasdaq smallcap market  and any further events of noncompliance would subject us to further delisting actions by nasdaq 
if we were delisted from nasdaq  we would pursue an alternative trading venue 
however  if this occurs  it would make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our securities 
in addition  it may make it more difficult for an investor to dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations of  our common shares and negatively impact the market price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through long and short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our interest income during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
approximately of our revenue was earned in germany by our subsidiary  datatrak gmbh 
we manage our risk to foreign currency exchange rates by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between united states dollars and the euro at december  would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet and a  change in our net loss for the year ended december  due to foreign currency transactions
