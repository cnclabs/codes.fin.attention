introduction on may   tricon global restaurants  inc changed its name to yum brands  inc in order to better reflect our expanding portfolio of brands 
in addition  on the same day  tricon restaurants international changed its name to yum restaurants international 
yum brands  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as yum or the company comprises the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut  taco bell  long john silver s ljs and a w all american food restaurants a w collectively the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
ljs and a w were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants  inc ygr on may  separately  kfc  pizza hut and taco bell rank in the top ten among qsr chains in us system sales and units 
with  international units  yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us yum became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
throughout management s discussion and analysis md a  we make reference to ongoing operating profit which represents our operating profit excluding the impact of facility actions net loss gain and unusual items income expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these exclusions 
we use ongoing operating profit as a key performance measure of our results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally 
ongoing operating profit is not a measure defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
all references to per share and share amounts in the following md a have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock split distributed on june  in  our international business  yum restaurants international yri or international accounted for of system sales  of revenues and of ongoing operating profit excluding unallocated and corporate expenses 
we anticipate that  despite the inherent risks and typically higher general and administrative expenses required by international operations  we will continue to invest in certain international markets with substantial growth potential 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages through and the cautionary statements on pages and all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages through tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgements could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level 
restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant 
our semi annual test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
these impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant on a held and used basis are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our cost of capital  adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist 
when it is probable that we will sell a restaurant we write down the restaurant to its fair value 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and therefore perform impairment evaluations at the group level 
fair value is based on the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs 
estimated sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to that for our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting units over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the reporting unit 
we impaired million of goodwill during related to our pizza hut france reporting unit 
for the remainder of our reporting units with goodwill  the fair value is generally significantly in excess of the recorded carrying value 
thus  we do not believe that we have material goodwill that is at risk to be impaired given current business performance 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables and contingent liabilities we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
primarily as a result of our refranchising efforts  we remain liable for certain lease assignments and guarantees 
we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees when such exposure is probable and estimable 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with million representing the present value of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december   discounted at our pre tax cost of debt 
current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty claims 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves at december   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
factors affecting comparability of results to results and results to results ygr acquisition on may   the company completed its acquisition of ygr  the parent company of ljs and a w 
see note for a discussion of the acquisition 
as of the date of the acquisition  ygr consisted of and company and franchise ljs units  respectively  and and company and franchise a w units  respectively 
in addition  multibranded ljs a w restaurants were included in the ljs unit totals 
except as discussed in certain sections of the md a  the impact of the acquisition on our results of operations in was not significant 
impact of recently adopted accounting pronouncement effective december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  in its entirety 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of december  the following table summarizes the favorable effect of sfas on restaurant profit  restaurant margin and ongoing operating profit had sfas been effective in year ended december  us international worldwide restaurant profit restaurant margin ongoing operating profit additionally  if sfas had been effective in  reported net income would have increased approximately million and diluted earnings per common share eps would have increased 
unusual items income expense we recorded unusual items income of million in and million in and unusual items expense of million in see note for a detailed discussion of our unusual items income expense 
impact of new unconsolidated affiliates consistent with our strategy to focus our capital on key international markets  we formed ventures in canada and poland with our largest franchisee in each market 
the venture in canada was formed in the third quarter of and the venture in poland was effective in the first quarter of at the date of formation  the canadian venture operated over stores and the poland venture operated approximately stores 
we did not record any gain or loss on the transfer of assets to these new ventures 
previously  the results from the restaurants we contributed to these ventures were consolidated 
the impact of these transactions on operating results is similar to the impact of our refranchising activities  which is described in the store portfolio strategy section below 
consequently  these transactions resulted in a decline in our company sales  restaurant margin dollars and general and administrative g a expenses as well as higher franchise fees 
we also record equity income loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliates equity income and  in canada  higher franchise fees since the royalty rate was increased for those stores contributed by our partner to the venture 
the formation of these ventures did not have a significant net impact on ongoing operating profit in store portfolio strategy since  we have been strategically reducing our share of total system units by selling company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve the restaurants overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
this portfolio balancing activity reduces our reported revenues and restaurant profits  which increases the importance of system sales as a key performance measure 
we substantially completed our us refranchising program in the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax a a includes million of previously deferred refranchising gains and a charge of million to mark to market the net assets of our singapore business  which was sold during at a price approximately equal to its carrying value 
in addition to our refranchising program  we have closed certain restaurants over the past several years 
restaurants closed include poor performing restaurants  restaurants relocated to a new site within the same trade area or us pizza hut delivery units consolidated with a new or existing dine in traditional store within the same trade area 
the following table summarizes company store closure activities number of units closed store closure costs impairment charges for stores to be closed the impact on ongoing operating profit arising from our refranchising and store closure initiatives as well as the contribution of company stores to new unconsolidated affiliates is the net of a the estimated reduction in company sales  restaurant profit and g a expenses  b the estimated increase in franchise fees from the stores refranchised  and c the estimated change in equity income loss 
the amounts presented below reflect the estimated impact from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective year 
the following table summarizes the estimated impact on revenue of refranchising  company store closures and  in  the contribution of company stores to unconsolidated affiliates us international worldwide decreased sales increased franchise fees decrease in total revenues us international worldwide decreased sales increased franchise fees decrease in total revenues the following table summarizes the estimated impact on ongoing operating profit of refranchising  company store closures and  in  the contribution of company stores to unconsolidated affiliates us international worldwide decreased restaurant margin increased franchise fees decreased g a decrease increase in ongoing operating profit us international worldwide decreased restaurant margin increased franchise fees decreased g a decreased equity income decrease in ongoing operating profit franchisee financial condition like others in the qsr industry  from time to time  some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties with respect to their franchise operations 
depending upon the facts and circumstances of each situation  and in the absence of an improvement in the franchisee s business trends  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues 
these include a sale of some or all of the operator s restaurants to us or a third party  a restructuring of the operator s business and or finances  or  in the more unusual cases  bankruptcy of the operator 
it is our practice to proactively work with financially troubled franchise operators in an attempt to positively resolve their issues 
since  certain of our franchise operators  principally in the taco bell system  have experienced varying degrees of financial problems 
through december   restructurings have been completed for approximately  taco bell franchise restaurants 
in connection with these restructurings  taco bell has acquired restaurants for approximately million 
in addition to these acquisitions  taco bell has purchased land  buildings and or equipment related to restaurants from franchisees for approximately million and simultaneously leased it back to these franchisees under long term leases 
as part of the restructurings  taco bell committed to fund approximately million of future franchise capital expenditures  principally through leasing arrangements  approximately million of which has been funded through december  we substantially completed the taco bell franchisee restructurings in and expect to finalize any remaining restructurings in the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  taco bell also established a million loan program to assist certain franchisees 
all fundings had been advanced by the end of the first quarter of a remaining net balance of million at december  for these notes receivable is included primarily in other assets 
we believe that the general improvement in business trends at taco bell has helped alleviate financial problems in the taco bell franchise system which were due to past downturns in sales 
as described in the us revenues section  company same store sales growth at taco bell increased in this follows an increase in company same store sales growth at taco bell in the fourth quarter of generally  franchisees have experienced similar or better growth over these time frames 
accordingly  the cost of restructurings of taco bell franchise restaurants was less in than in and  though we continue to monitor this situation  we expect these costs to be less again in in and  the company charged expenses of million and million  respectively  to ongoing operating profit related to allowances for doubtful taco bell franchise and license fee receivables 
these costs are reported as part of franchise and license expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we assess our exposure from franchise related risks  which include estimated uncollectibility of franchise and license receivables  contingent lease liabilities  guarantees to support third party financial arrangements of franchisees and potential claims by franchisees 
the contingent lease liabilities and guarantees are more fully discussed in the lease guarantees section of note although the ultimate impact of these franchise financial issues cannot be predicted with certainty at this time  we have provided for our current estimate of the probable exposure as of december  it is reasonably possible that there will be additional costs  however  these costs are not expected to be material to quarterly or annual results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
impact of ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process see note for a discussion of the impact of the ameriserve food distribution  inc ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process on the company 
impact of the consolidation of an unconsolidated affiliate at the beginning of  we consolidated a previously unconsolidated affiliate in our consolidated financial statements as a result of a change in our intent to temporarily retain control of this affiliate 
as a result of this change  company sales  restaurant margin and g a increased approximately million  million and million  respectively  in also as a result of the change  franchise fees and equity income decreased approximately million and million  respectively  in at the date of consolidation  this previously unconsolidated affiliate operated over stores

see note for a discussion of the share repurchase programs 
financing activities on june   we closed on a new billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the new credit facility 
the new credit facility replaced the existing bank credit agreement which was comprised of a senior unsecured term loan facility and a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility collectively referred to as the old credit facilities that were scheduled to mature on october  on december   we voluntarily reduced our maximum borrowings under the new credit facility from billion to billion 
the new credit facility matures on june  we used the initial borrowings under the new credit facility to repay the indebtedness under the old credit facilities 
the new credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains other terms and provisions including representations  warranties  covenants  conditions and events of default similar to those set forth in the old credit facilities 
specifically  the new credit facility contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the new credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  cash dividends  aggregate non us investment and certain other transactions as defined in the agreement 
under the terms of the new credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   our unused new credit facility totaled billion  net of outstanding letters of credit of billion 
the interest rate for borrowings under the new credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or to over an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  will depend upon our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest is payable at least quarterly 
in the third quarter of  we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately million related to the new credit facility 
these debt issuance costs will be amortized into interest expense over the life of the new credit facility 
in june  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due july  the notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used to repay indebtedness under the new credit facility 
interest on the notes is payable january and july of each year and commenced on january  we capitalized debt issuance costs of approximately million related to the notes in third quarter of subsequent to this issuance  we have million available for issuance under a billion shelf registration filed in as discussed in note  upon the acquisition of ygr  we assumed approximately million in present value of future rent obligations related to certain sale leaseback agreements entered into by ygr involving approximately ljs units 
as a result of liens held by the buyer lessor on certain personal property within the units  the sale leaseback agreements have been accounted for as financings and are reflected as debt in our consolidated financial statements as of december  rental payments made under these agreements will be made on a monthly basis through with an effective interest rate of approximately 
consolidated financial condition assets increased million or to billion 
this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of ygr and the impact of capital spending 
the decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million was primarily the result of recoveries related to the ameriserve bankruptcy reorganization process see note and the write off of receivables previously fully reserved 
the increase in assets classified as held for sale is due primarily to classification of our puerto rico market as held for sale during the fourth quarter of liabilities increased million or to billion 
the increase was primarily due to additional financing associated with the acquisition of ygr 
as discussed in note  the decrease in short term borrowings of million and the increase in long term debt of million are primarily the result of the replacement of our old credit facilities that were to expire in october with the new credit facility that will expire in the increase in current income taxes payable was primarily the result of a reclassification from other liabilities and deferred credits for taxes that are now expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
liquidity operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment in operating assets 
typically  our cash flows include a significant amount of discretionary capital spending 
though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations  we believe our operating cash flows and ability to adjust discretionary capital spending and borrow funds will allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  due by period included total less than year years years more than years long term debt a   short term borrowings debt excluding capital leases   capital leases b operating leases b  franchisee financing commitments total contractual obligations    a excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to approximately  restaurants 
see note for a discussion of short term borrowings and long term debt and note for a discussion of leases 
in addition  we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
as of december   the maximum exposure under these commercial commitments  which are shown on a nominal basis  included contingent liabilities associated with lease assignments or guarantees standby letters of credit a guarantees of unconsolidated affiliates debt b other commercial commitments a includes million related to guarantees of financial arrangements of franchisees  which are supported by stand by letters of credit 
b as of december   this debt totaled approximately million  our share of which was approximately million 
as noted above  we have guaranteed million of this total debt obligation 
our unconsolidated affiliates had total assets of over billion as of year end and total revenues of approximately billion in see notes and for a further discussion of these commitments 
other significant known events  trends or uncertainties expected to impact operating profit comparisons with new accounting pronouncements see note pension plan funded status certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans was amended in such that employees hired after september  are no longer eligible to participate 
as of our september  measurement date  these plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million  an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and a fair value of plan assets of million 
subsequent to the measurement date but prior to december   we made an additional million contribution to the plans which is not included in this fair value of plan assets 
as a result of the million underfunded status of the plans relative to the pbo at september   we have recorded a million charge to shareholders equity net of tax of million as of december  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at september  a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately million at september  conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately million at september  due to recent stock market declines  our pension plan assets have experienced losses in value in and totaling approximately million 
we changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to for the determination of our expense 
we believe that this assumption is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
this change resulted in the recognition of approximately million in incremental expense in comparison to we will continue to use the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption for the determination of pension expense in given no change to the market related value of our plan assets as of september   a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our plan assets have experienced  along with the decrease in discount rates  have largely contributed to the unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our plans as of september  for purposes of determining expense our funded status was such that we recognized million of unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial loss in given no change to the assumptions at our september  measurement date  actuarial loss recognition will increase gradually over the next few years  however  we do not believe the increase will materially impact our results of operations 
in total  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million to million in we have incorporated this incremental expense into our operating plans and outlook 
the increase is driven by an increase in interest cost because of the higher pbo and the recognition of actuarial losses as discussed in the preceding paragraph 
service cost will also increase as a result of the lower discount rate  though as previously mentioned the plans are closed to new participants 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption of at september  would impact our pension expense by approximately million 
we do not believe that the underfunded status of the pension plans will materially affect our financial position or cash flows in or future years 
given current funding levels and discount rates we would anticipate making contributions to fully fund the pension plans over the course of the next five years 
we believe that our cash flows from operating activities of approximately billion per year are sufficient to allow us to make necessary contributions to the plans  and anticipated fundings have been incorporated into our cash flow projections 
we have included known and expected increases in our pension expense as well as future expected plan contributions in our operating plans and outlook 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a significant market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in a reduction of million and million  respectively  in annual income before taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the unhedged portion of our variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk international ongoing operating profit constitutes approximately of our ongoing operating profit in  excluding unallocated and corporate expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  the americas and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december   and december   did not significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  potentially substantial tax contingencies related to the spin off  which  if they occur  require us to indemnify pepsico  inc  our substantial debt leverage and the attendant potential restriction on our ability to borrow in the future  as well as our substantial interest expense and principal repayment obligations  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  global and local business  economic and political conditions  legislation and governmental regulation  competition  success of operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  any adverse economic or operational repercussions from terrorist activities and any governmental response thereto  and war or risk of war
