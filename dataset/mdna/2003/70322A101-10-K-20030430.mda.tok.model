critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
it is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment based on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows 
we estimated future cash flows based on several economic and business assumptions and have concluded that there is no impairment of such assets at february  however  our estimates project cash flow several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective with the beginning of fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer being amortized but rather is being evaluated for impairment at least annually 
based on an independent evaluation of its fair value completed when sfas no 
was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal  the company concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill 
the company performed its annual evaluation of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and  based on an independent evaluation of its fair value  concluded that there was no impairment of its goodwill 
since such impairment evaluation is based on several economic and business assumptions  the goodwill impairment evaluation in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions  changes in consumer spending  the competitive environment in which the company operates and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report 
pension plans 
pension income for all company pension plans was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million on a combined predecessor company and successor company pro forma basis for fiscal and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan the qualified plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations by several respected consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical year and year compounded returns of and  respectively  which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices  despite the recent market downturn in which our qualified plan assets had a loss of for fiscal our expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets have been based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of 
because of market fluctuation  our actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we believe  however  that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
as part of our on going process to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  we are reducing our expected long term rate of return from to in fiscal a reduction in our expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets  holding all other factors constant  would have reduced our pension income for fiscal by approximately million 
a reduction in our discount rate and salary increase assumptions  holding all other factors constant  would have reduced our pension income for fiscal by approximately million 
we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a three year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the years prior to our plan of reorganization in fiscal  we had generated and amortized unrecognized net actuarial gains 
as a result of our plan of reorganization in fiscal  unrecognized net actuarial gains of approximately million were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as part of fresh start reporting 
since the completion of our plan of reorganization  we generated unrecognized net actuarial losses due to the unfavorable performance of the equity markets 
as of february   we had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses result in decreases in our future pension income depending on several factors  including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at february  to at february  due to the effect of the unrecognized actuarial losses and based on an expected rate of return on our qualified plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans will approximate million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
future actual pension income will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans 
the value of our qualified plan assets has decreased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have reduced our overfunded qualified plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  despite the recent reductions in the funded status of our qualified plan  we believe that  based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our qualified plan  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our qualified plan for at least the next three years 
self insured claims liabilities and postemployment benefits 
we are self insured for claims relating to customer  associate and vehicle accidents  as well as associate medical and disability benefits  and we maintain third party excess insurance coverage for such claims 
it is our accounting policy to record a self insured liability  as determined actuarially on a consistent basis  based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk free interest rate 
all claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
at february   liabilities for self insured claims and benefits were million and for postemployment benefits were million 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs

sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the exit plan commitment date 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company believes that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligation it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations do not apply to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal see note 
the company does not expect adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company continues to apply apb opinion no

required in sfas no 
for fiscal year end reporting 
the company will adopt the amendment to apb opinion no

this interpretation requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities vie if the enterprise is a primary beneficiary holds a majority of the variable interest of the vie and the vie possesses specific characteristics 
it also requires additional disclosure for parties involved with vies 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective for fiscal since the company does not have any unconsolidated vies  the adoption of fin no 
will not have an impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt  which carries variable interest rates 
as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to interest rate risk  in july  we entered into a three year interest rate zero cost collar  consisting of a cap with a strike of and a floor with a strike of  on a notional amount of million of our term loan 
variable rate debt outstanding under our term loan was million on february  as of february   the weighted average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under our term loan  including the impact of the zero cost collar on million of our term loan  was 
a change in interest rates applied to the million balance of floating rate term loan debt would affect pre tax annual results of operations by approximately million 
we also have million of senior subordinated notes outstanding on february   which bear interest payable semi annually at a fixed rate of  and are therefore not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations 
the principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to facilitate our funding needs 
as part of our risk management  we may use additional derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps in the future
