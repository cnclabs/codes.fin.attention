item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including changes in general economic conditions and competitive market conditions  pricing pressures  relationships with key customers  industry consolidation of retailers  wholesalers and builders  shifts in distribution  the influence of e commerce  and other factors discussed in the overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview the company is engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
the company also supplies and installs insulation and other building products for builders in the new construction market 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure  fluctuations in european currencies primarily the european euro and british pound  the importance of and the company s relationships with home centers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s sales in as distributors of home improvement and building products and the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition 
historically  the company has been able to largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions and acquisitions as well as market share gains 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
the company maintains investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds  which aggregated million  and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million  at december  the investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period  or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions 
the investments in marketable equity securities and bond funds are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
future changes in market conditions  the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
on january   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is no longer recording amortization expense related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company completed the transitional goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing in and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of income tax credit of million  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january  see cumulative effect of accounting change for additional discussion of the adoption of this standard 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed the annual impairment testing of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
this test indicated that no additional impairment of such assets occurred in intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures and a three percent long term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for individual business units were greater than the carrying values related to business units with goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
in contrast  if the current estimate of future discounted cash flows had been percent lower  the company would have been required to recognize a pre tax impairment loss of approximately million 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
the company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consultants  lawyers and actuaries 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company decreased its discount rate to percent from percent  which reflects the decline in long term interest rates 
the assumed asset return is percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the plan assets were invested in equities percent  bonds percent and cash percent at december  the company s underfunded amount for the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets increased to million from million in this is the result of the change in the discount rate  plan amendments  asset returns below projections and the inclusion of the furnishings international inc pension obligation of approximately million at december  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
the plan assets in had a loss of approximately percent as compared with declines of percent and percent for the dow jones industrial average and the standard poor s  respectively 
the company expects pension expense for its defined benefit plans to increase by approximately million in  principally as a result of lower asset returns 
if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was percent instead of percent  the impact on pension expense for would be an increase of approximately million 
the company has considered future income and gains from investments and other identified tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain operating assets  in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are generally covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the lifetime  under certain circumstances  of the original purchaser 
at the time of sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or service to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expected future conditions 
to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments 
corporate development mergers and acquisitions have historically contributed significantly to masco s growth 
generally  the earnings benefit to masco arises from the subsequent growth of merged and acquired businesses  since incremental sales are not impacted by the initial transaction related costs and expenses such as interest and added depreciation and amortization
