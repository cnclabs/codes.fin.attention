critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and its related interpretations 
revenue is recognized when the following conditoins exist there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered and accepted or services and supplies have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of delivery and acceptance by the customer of the phd system 
service and supplies revenue is recognized when services are rendered and supplies are delivered 
the company also leases the phd system to customers on a short term basis months or less and recognizes revenue on these contracts on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the company has no contracts with distributors and sells its product directly to its customers through its own sales force 
accrued liabilities and contingencies the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable to determine the amount of accrued liabilities and contingencies to be recorded 
if actual results differ from these estimates  additional expenditures might be recorded 
net deferred tax assets valuation the company records its net deferred tax assets in the amount that it expects to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of its valuation  assumptions and estimates are required such as the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
given the company s historical losses and uncertainty with respect to the company s ability to generate taxable income  management has established a valuation allowance of  at december  and  at december  to reduce the net deferred tax assets to zero

these forward looking statements reflect the company s views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following i uncertainty about the acceptance of the phd system by both potential users and purchasers  including without limitation patients  clinics and other health care providers  ii risks related to uncertain unit pricing and product cost  which may not be at levels that permit the company to be profitable  iii market  regulatory reimbursement and competitive conditions  iv risks related to the failure to meet additional development and manufacturing milestones for the phd system on a timely basis  v the company s ability to obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms to run its business  vi risks inherent in relying on a third party to manufacture the phd system  and vii changes in qsr requirements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million per share  compared with million per share  for the year ended december  the factors contributing to the decrease in net loss are explained below 
revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue was million compared to no revenue for the year ended december  product revenue of  resulted primarily from the sale of seven phd systems 
service and supplies revenue totaled  for fiscal the product sales recorded in fiscal were for phd systems sold in the united states 
the sales recorded were made pursuant to an agreement between the company and a third party leasing provider units and through direct sales to two customers units 
the company is not dependent upon reimbursement from insurance providers as a source of revenue 
rather  the company generates revenue from dialysis centers  which provide dialysis services through the use of the phd system 
the dialysis center is reimbursed on a per treatment basis by the insurance provider 
accordingly  reimbursement rates may influence customers demand for the company s product and the company s pricing of the phd system and related supplies and service 
service and supplies sold during fiscal specifically relate to the phd systems placed during the year 
service and supply revenue is contracted under a separate agreement with a dialysis center at an established monthly amount 
supplies  such as blood tubing sets  dialyzers and acid bicarb solutions  are required to perform dialysis treatments 
service on the phd system is for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repairs and is provided by the company s service technicians on a hour  day a week basis 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales for fiscal was million compared to no cost of sales in fiscal product cost of sales for were million and service and supplies costs were million 
included in product cost of sales is an inventory adjustment in the amount of million  in order to value the phd machines in inventory at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of producing the phd system is currently in excess of its market price and the company cannot predict how long such deficit will continue or whether the company will be able to eliminate such deficit 
the company expects that it will have to rely primarily on reductions in the production cost of the phd system in order to realize a positive gross margin on sales 
the company is implementing plans and continues to work diligently to achieve cost reductions on the phd system 
these efforts include  among others  the redesign of phd subsystems and sourcing alternative materials and supplies 
however  no assurance can be given that such cost reduction plans or efforts will be successful  or that the company will be able to achieve a positive gross margin on sales of the phd system in the future 
service and supplies costs for the year ended december  were million compared to no service and supplies costs for the year ended december  the majority of these costs are for field service personnel to install and service the phd machines and for clinical support staff necessary to train the customers nursing staff during the early phases of the product launch 
the cost of services and supplies is currently in excess of their market price as local presence of field service and clinical service personnel is required in each geographical area that phd systems are sold 
the company expects that as more phd units are placed in those geographical areas  the per unit cost of services and supplies will decrease 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in was attributable to reduced research and development activities due to the company receiving fda approval for its product in march and the company s related shift in focus from product development to commercialization and sales activities 
sales and marketing expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses increased million  from million in to million in the increase is attributable to personnel additions in and costs associated with the scale up of the sales and marketing efforts surrounding the early stages of commercialization of the phd system 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million to million 
the increase is primarily a result of personnel additions necessary to support the commercialization efforts 
interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on investments and the company s use of cash and cash equivalents to fund operations during results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net loss for the year ended december  was million per share  compared with million per share  for the year ended december  during the fiscal year  the company recognized revenue of million related to co development of the phd system with teijin limited of osaka  japan 
there was no such related joint development income in the fiscal year joint development income 
on june   the company entered into a co development and license agreement the agreement with teijin 
under the terms of the agreement  teijin paid the company a million co development fee relating to the phd system 
use of the proceeds from the co development fee was restricted to development costs incurred on the phd system and could not be used for other general corporate purposes 
amounts paid under the co development arrangement were recognized as revenue as development costs on the phd system were incurred 
during the year ended december   the company recognized revenue of million related to co development of the phd system 
during  the agreement was amended 
the final revenue related to the co development of the phd system under the agreement was recognized in and there was no joint development income in fiscal 
the remaining unspent amount was recorded as an amount due to teijin of approximately  at december  included in other liabilities and was subsequently spent exclusively on development activities by teijin s research employees 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in was attributable to labor costs decreasing by approximately million and the completion of many activities associated with the development of the phd system during sales and marketing expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses increased million  from million in to million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in personnel in related to planning for commercialization of the phd system 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million to million 
the increase is primarily a result of additions to the senior management team during the middle of and a staff addition in the beginning of interest income 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates on investments and the company s use of cash and cash equivalents to fund operations during liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company has financed its operations to date primarily through public and private sales of its equity securities 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and restricted long term investments of million 
the company believes that inflation generally has not had a material impact on its operations or liquidity to date 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in compared to is primarily due to reduced research and development costs  as the company shifts its focus from product development to commercialization and sales activities 
the increase in inventory of million in compared to is attributable to the production of commercial phd machines during the last three quarters of and was partially offset by reduced deposits with vendors and high accounts payable balances in net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase of investments 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal primarily relating to maturing investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
cash provided from financing activities resulted from the issuance of common stock in connection with private placement transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the specific private placement transactions 
recent financing activities on january   the company entered into a million equity line of credit arrangement with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge 
this arrangement superceded a similar arrangement entered into between the company and kingsbridge on october  pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated common stock purchase agreement between the company and kingsbridge  the company may sell common stock at its sole discretion over a month period on a when and if needed basis  and kingsbridge is required under the terms of the agreement to purchase this stock  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the agreement 
the company has no obligation to draw down all or any portion of the commitment 
as partial consideration for entering into the equity line arrangement  the company issued warrants to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants had a fair value of  using the black scholes pricing model 
the company has filed a registration statement with the sec covering the equity line arrangement that was declared effective by the sec on february  through march   the company issued  shares of common stock to kingsbridge under the equity line arrangement and received million 
on october   the company filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec 
the registration statement  which has not yet become effective  will cover up to million of various types of securities from time to time 
financing needs the company estimates that during fiscal it will spend between and million for operations  including us commercialization activities of the phd system 
the company expects to incur increasingly substantial cash outlays related to manufacturing scale up and commercialization of the phd system 
the company believes that cash and short term investments as of december  coupled with the million equity line of credit arrangement with kingsbridge are sufficient to finance the company s commercial and operating plans through december  the company plans to raise additional capital to fund operations through public and or private equity or debt financings in fiscal and subsequent years 
the additional capital required for commercialization may not be available on terms agreeable to the company or may not be available at all 
generally  the company expects us customers to lease or purchase phd systems and enter into contracts whereby the company will provide all consumables  service and product support related to the phd systems for a single monthly price 
if the us customers enter into lease agreements  the single monthly payment would increase to include the lease payment for the phd system 
the company s present commercialization plan for markets outside of the united states is to develop a partnership in those markets to distribute the phd system and related consumables and services 
financing production of the phd system in quantities necessary for commercialization will require a significant investment in working capital 
this need for working capital will increase to the extent that demand for the phd system increases 
in addition to any debt or equity financing transactions  the company may seek to finance the working capital requirements associated with these arrangements primarily through equipment and receivable financing with a commercial lender 
if the company is unable to obtain such equipment financing  or to obtain it on commercially reasonable terms  it would need to seek other forms of financing  through the sale of equity securities or otherwise  to achieve its business objectives 
the company has not yet obtained a commitment for such equipment financing  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain equipment financing or alternative financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s funding needs will depend on many factors  including the timing and costs associated with continued progress in research and development  manufacturing scale up  increased sales and marketing activities  the cost involved in filing and enforcing patent claims and the status of competitive products 
in the event that the company s plans change  its assumptions change or prove inaccurate or it is unable to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  the company could be required to seek additional financing sooner than currently anticipated 
the company has not generated taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income were approximately million 
because the company has experienced ownership changes  future utilization of the carryforwards may be limited in any one fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce federal income tax liabilities
