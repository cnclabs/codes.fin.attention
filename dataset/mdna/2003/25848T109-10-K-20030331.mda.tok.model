the underlying information and expectations are likely to change over time 
actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth in this item and under the caption business and risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent provider of highly reliable  high performance disk based data storage and networking solutions for the open systems computing environment  including windows linux  and all variations of unix 
our solutions encompass a broad range of scalable products from stand alone storage systems to complete  turnkey storage area networks sans 
our systems run on different protocols including small computer systems interface scsi and fibre channel 
beginning in  we shifted our sales and marketing efforts away from direct sales and toward indirect sales through channel partners  including oems  vars and system integrators 
our sales force is now focused on sales to channel partners regardless of the end user market that those channel partners serve 
our channel partners either integrate our systems into their products  private label our products  or simply sell our products off the shelf 
in may  we signed an oem agreement with a key channel partner  sun microsystems 
based on our anticipated need to manufacture product in large volume for sun and other channel partners  we further refined our business strategy to include a third party manufacturer  solectron  to supply the bulk  of our new product production capacity going forward  particularly for our next generation  sannet ii family of disk systems 
during october  we began shipping to sun the first product in our sannet ii family of systems  sannet ii scsi  for resale to sun s customers 
sales from this product accounted for approximately of our net revenue in the fourth quarter of we began shipping a second product to sun for resale to its customers in march we expect sun to make generally available to its customers two additional products awarded under the oem agreement during the second and third quarters of  respectively 
solectron manufactured a large portion of the pre production units of sannet ii scsi systems  and all of the sannet ii scsi systems since the products release 
we believe that the decision to outsource manufacturing will allow us to reduce expenses related to our internal manufacturing operations between the first and third quarters of  while enhancing our research and development activities and providing continued engineering support to our channel partners 
our on site manufacturing operations  which are conducted from our headquarters in carlsbad  california  consist primarily of the assembly and integration of components and subassemblies into our products  with certain of those subassemblies manufactured by independent contractors 
we generally extend to our customers the warranties provided to us by our suppliers 
for warranty costs not covered by our suppliers  we provide for estimated warranty costs in the period the revenue is recognized and these costs have been insignificant 
on a quarterly and annual basis our gross margins have been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  product configuration  product mix  the availability of new products and product enhancements  and the cost and availability of components 
pricing pressures exist in the data storage market  and have had and may in the future continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
these pricing pressures are due  in part  to continuing decreases in component prices  such as disks and raid controllers 
these decreases in component price are customarily passed on to customers by storage companies through the continuing decrease in price of storage hardware systems 
pricing pressures are also due  in part  to the current difficult economic conditions  which have led many companies in our industry to pursue a strategy of decreasing prices in order to win sales 
a leading computer industry analyst group recently reported that disk hardware system prices declined at an annual rate of from august to october this rate of decline is expected to continue through by both the analyst group and ourselves  due to various factors including changes in vendors relationships  pricing strategies  a narrowing of functional differences among competitors  new technology and difficult economic conditions 
we market and distribute our products and services through channel partners and through our direct sales force currently employed in domestic offices and overseas sales offices located in japan  the united kingdom  the netherlands  germany and singapore 
we recognize revenue for non software product sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer based on the respective shipping terms 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are recorded at the time of shipment 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and significantly greater response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar services  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
for software sales we apply statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses at the time the product is delivered  provided we have no significant obligations related to the sale  the resulting receivable is deemed collectible and there is vendor specific objective evidence supporting the value of the separate contract elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items 
a portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements  typically software maintenance costs  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes a software licensing fee and maintenance agreement 
operating expenses consist primarily of rent  payroll  commissions  other selling and administrative expenses  and engineering and product development costs  and are recognized in the period incurred 
the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenue gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing engineering and product development general and administrative restructuring expenses operating loss net loss results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue reflects the invoiced amounts of products shipped  less reserves for estimated returns  and revenues from service contracts 
net revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was attributable to unfavorable market conditions resulting in a decrease in sales from the telecommunications sector and a decrease in sales from the commercial sector  partially offset by million in sales to our channel partner  sun 
sales of our sannet and sannet ii products accounted for approximately of net revenue  tape backup for approximately of net revenue  services for approximately of net revenue and legacy products and other for approximately of net revenue 
sales to our oem and system integrator partners accounted for approximately of net revenue  sales to direct customers accounted for approximately of net revenue  and sales to resellers accounted for approximately of net revenue  with service and other accounting for approximately of net revenue 
sales to sun accounted for approximately of net revenue  xsps  telecommunications  and e commerce customers accounted for approximately of net revenue  sales to government accounted for approximately of net revenue  and sales to other customers accounted for approximately of net revenue 
for the year ended december   sales of our sannet and sannet ii products accounted for approximately of net revenue  tape backup for approximately of net revenue  services for approximately of net revenue and legacy products and other for approximately of net revenue 
for the year ended december   sales to oem and system integrator partners accounted for approximately of net revenue  sales to direct customers accounted for approximately of net revenue  sales to resellers accounted for approximately of revenue  with service and other accounting for approximately of net revenue 
for the year ended december   sales to xsps  telecommunications  and e commerce customers accounted for approximately of net revenue  sales to government accounted for approximately of net revenue  and sales to other customers accounted for approximately of net revenue 
we anticipate going forward that the declining health of the telecommunications industry  which affected our operations during and  will have substantially less of an effect on our operations and liquidity position due to our shift in focus away from direct sales toward indirect sales through channel partners 
our focus on channel partners  regardless of the customer market served by the partners  has reduced our dependence on purchases by the telecommunication sector 
for the fiscal year ended december   sales to the telecommunications sector accounted for of our net revenue 
in the fourth quarter of  sales to the telecommunications sector were just of net revenue 
we expect this trend to continue  and the percentage of our net revenue accounted for by sales to the telecommunications industry to further diminish throughout as compared to gross margin gross margin for was million  or of net revenue  compared to a gross margin of million  or of net revenue  for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to a million charge over the course of for excess and obsolete inventory  million of which was related to the impact that our new product sannet ii launch will have on existing inventories of our sannet product  and approximately million in ramp up costs and inefficiencies incurred during the fourth quarter of related to our new sannet ii scsi product  which was launched in october we expect ramp up costs for our sannet ii scsi product to be lower for the first quarter  and primarily phased out by the end of the second quarter the conclusion of ramp up costs for our sannet ii scsi product will have a positive effect on gross margin  but will be offset by the commencement of ramp up costs for our sannet ii fc product  which are expected to be incurred during the first and second quarters of we also expect to incur ramp up costs for our sannet ii blade and sannet ii nas products  but anticipate those costs to be substantially lower than the costs for the sannet ii scsi and sannet ii fc products 
by the fourth quarter of  we anticipate that continuing cost reduction efforts in areas such as hard tooling and sub assembly processes  as well as the conclusion of ramp up costs on new sannet ii products  will enable us to attain overall gross margins in the mid range 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses typically consist of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
in  sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue for in may  we entered into a product purchase agreement with sun  whereby we provide certain products for private label sales by sun 
as part of the agreement  sun was granted a warrant valued at million 
the warrant was issued to induce sun to purchase our products in the future  and is exercisable at any time without restriction other than the passage of time 
the warrant was not issued in consideration for any past transactions 
as we received no consideration for the issuance of the warrant and the customer has no requirement to purchase any products from us  the entire value of the warrant was charged to sales and marketing expense during the second quarter of and represents of net revenue 
excluding this charge  sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for from million for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses  excluding the charge for the warrant  is attributable to fixed cost reduction measures  such as geographical restructuring of the sales force and our efforts to focus our marketing resources on a smaller population of potential channel partners  rather than the broad and diverse direct sales markets 
excluding the charge for the warrant  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses were for compared to for during  we engaged in an effort to leverage our existing sales force and marketing resources in connection with our change in business strategy by reducing expenses  even as revenues increased in the last quarter of we expect to maintain approximately our current level of sales and marketing expenses during engineering and product development expenses engineering and product development expenses consist of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
engineering and product development expenses increased to million for from million for the increase in engineering and product development expenses is attributable to costs related to the development of our next generation sannet ii product line  the first member of which was released in october as a percentage of net revenue  engineering and product development expenses increased to for compared to for due to increased spending  as mentioned above  as well as lower sales revenue during compared to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions and expenditures for administrative facilities

however  we may need additional capital to pursue acquisitions or significant capital improvements  neither of which is currently contemplated 
although we expect to achieve profitability in the second quarter of  we currently do not generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our capital requirements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from continued operations  our ability to manage third party manufacturers  the course of our relationship with key customers including sun  partners including solectron  our third party manufacturer and suppliers including infortrend  the supplier of controllers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services  and growth in personnel and operations 
we were subject to a legal action first filed by celtic capital corporation celtic against us on april  in the superior court of the state of california and later amended the celtic litigation 
the plaintiffs alleged violations of the california commercial code and breach of contract among other commercial claims

on april   the parties reached a settlement agreement in the celtic litigation 
under the settlement agreement  we paid celtic  on april  and made payments of  per month from may  through september  the final payment of  was made on october   and the action has now been finalized 
because the parties reached a tentative settlement agreement prior to the filing of our annual report on form k for  we recorded the expenses of this settlement agreement  totaling  in other expenses for the year ended december  in exchange for the foregoing  celtic released us from all claims and causes of action related to the complaint 
we also received from the cross defendants a global release of all claims  and all goods  work in process and inventory in the possession of the cross defendants  which was in any way related to our purchase orders the dot hill inventory 
in exchange for our receipt of the dot hill inventory  we released the cross defendants from all claims and causes of action related to the cross complaint 
factors that may affect our financial condition and future results our sales and operating results have in the past fluctuated from quarter to quarter and may vary in the future depending on a number of factors  including the size and timing of significant purchase orders  the timing of hardware shipments by third party vendors necessary to recognize revenues  our ability to continue to design  develop and market new products and services  market acceptance of new products  such as the new sannet ii line of systems  our need to litigate claims that may arise  the size and number of new accounts  technological changes in the storage systems market  our success in managing third party manufacturers  reduction in demand for our products as a result of new product introductions by competitors  levels of expenditure on research and development  the amount of additional capital needed by us and the timing of such needs  product quality problems  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and general economic trends and other factors 
sales and operating results for past periods are not necessarily indicative of future periods and a period to period comparison of our sales or results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty provisions  revenue recognition  allowances for bad debt  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  income taxes  deferred income tax asset valuation and contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from non software product sales when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer based on the respective shipping terms 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are recorded at the time of shipment 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and significantly greater response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts  this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar service  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
for software sales  we apply statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses at the time the product is delivered  provided there are no significant obligations related to the sale  the resulting receivable is deemed collectible and there is vendor specific objective evidence supporting the value of the separate contract elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items 
a portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements  typically software maintenance contracts  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally months 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes a software licensing fee and maintenance agreement 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform periodic valuation assessments based on projected sales forecasts and analyzing upcoming changes in future configurations of our products and record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts  we periodically are faced with uncertainties 
the outcomes of these uncertainties are not within our control  and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and commitments  and consequently  on our operating results 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those forecasted  inventory write downs and or increases to inventory reserves might be required  adversely affecting operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible asset 
sfas no

this statement supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we will follow the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

fin no 
is an interpretation of sfas nos 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosures of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields  and to maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money market funds  certificates of deposit  us government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not expect to incur any material losses with respect to our investment portfolio 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  and in thousands 
for investment securities  the table presents carrying value at december  and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
december  cash equivalents   average interest rate short term investments  average interest rate total portfolio   average interest rate our lines of credit with a japanese bank are at fixed interest rates  therefore  we do not have any interest rate risk exposure on these debts 
in february  we entered into a line of credit agreement  which incurs interest at a variable rate 
we do not currently have any balances outstanding under this line 
however  if we were to borrow funds under this line of credit  we would be exposed to interest rate risk on this debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not previously undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the future
