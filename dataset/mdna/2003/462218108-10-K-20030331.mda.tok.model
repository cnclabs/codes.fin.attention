item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading water purification company engaged worldwide in the supply of water and related activities and the supply of water treatment equipment through the use of proprietary separations technologies and systems 
the company s products and services are used by the company or its customers to desalt brackish water and seawater  recycle and reclaim process water and wastewater  to treat water in the home  to manufacture and supply water treatment chemicals and ultrapure water  to process food products  and to measure levels of waterborne contaminants and pollutants 
the company s customers include industrial companies  consumers  municipalities and other governmental entities and utilities 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refers to the activities of the company s four business groups  which comprise the company s reportable operating segments 
these groups are the equipment business group ebg  ultrapure water group uwg  consumer water group cwg and instrument business group ibg 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding its four business segments 
within the existing business group structure  the company has instituted a matrix type organization which became effective at the beginning of within each business group  the company has begun to focus on centers of excellence  which represent the application of treatment or separation technologies contained in the ionics toolbox r to solve certain application problems 
the company utilizes its water treatment and liquids separation expertise by employing its own proprietary products and other commodity products in the best integrated combination to solve customers application problems 
these centers of excellence include desalination  reuse  surface water  microelectronics  pharmaceuticals and instruments  among others  and each represents a range of technology solutions to solve a related applications problem 
the ebg segment provides products and services for seawater and brackish water desalination  water reuse and recycle  surface water treatment  and zero liquid discharge 
significant factors influencing the desalination market include worldwide water shortages  the need for better quality water in many parts of the world  and the reduced cost of operating of modern desalination facilities 
these factors have driven a trend toward larger plants  and toward the purchase of water supply and operating and maintenance contracts 
trends impacting the water reuse and recycle market are similar  with membrane technology becoming proven in reuse and recycling applications 
the surface water market has been influenced primarily by regulatory pressures to reduce contaminants in water supplies 
the use of membrane technology is also becoming more accepted in surface water applications 
the zero liquid discharge market  which consists of equipment and services for the minimization of liquid waste through such techniques as evaporation  concentration and crystallization  has been influenced by regulatory pressures on utilities to eliminate discharge of process water 
the company believes that it is positioned to be able to compete successfully in these applications  although it frequently faces substantially larger competitors 
the uwg segment provides equipment and services for the microelectronics  power  and pharmaceutical industries  where high quality ultrapure ie very highly purified water is required for use in production processes  and is critical to ultimate product quality and yield 
the uwg segment has historically been heavily reliant upon the microelectronics industry  and the continued softness in that industry has adversely impacted both revenue and profitability 
the uwg segment has been pursuing applications in other markets  such as power  pharmaceuticals and flat panel display  to lessen its reliance upon the microelectronics market 
the cwg segment provides home water units for the treatment of residential water 
prior to the divestiture of the aqua cool pure bottled water business in the us  us and france on december   it was also engaged in the home and office delivery market for bottled water 
the cwg segment also produces bleach based cleaning products and automobile windshield wash solution 
trends in the consumer water market include increased consumer awareness of and the need for improved water quality  and reduced confidence in the quality of existing water supplies 
the ibg segment manufactures and sells instruments and related products for the measurement of impurities in water 
the segment serves the pharmaceutical  microelectronics and power markets where the measurement of water quality  including levels and types of contaminants in process water  is critical to production processes 
the ibg segment has established a strong position in the pharmaceutical industry  providing products and services that facilitate compliance with both domestic and foreign regulatory requirements 
like the uwg segment  the performance of the ibg segment has been impacted by the downturn in the microelectronics industry  although to a lesser extent than the uwg segment 
the ebg and uwg segments have historically supplied equipment and related membranes 
starting in the mid s  these groups also began to own and operate facilities that sell desalted or otherwise treated water directly to customers under water supply agreements 
the revenues and cost of sales associated with equipment sales are recorded in the revenue and cost of sales lines on the company s consolidated statement of operations in the periods in which the revenues are realized 
equipment contracts are generally accounted for under the percentage completion accounting method  and the period of time over which costs are incurred and revenues are realized may vary between six months and two years  depending on the nature and amount of equipment being supplied 
for water supply agreements  with respect to smaller projects  of which the company is the sole owner  the initial cost of the equipment becomes part of the company s depreciable fixed asset base  and the revenues and cost of sales recorded by the company are those that are associated with the supply of water under the water supply agreement 
these contracts typically vary in length between and years 
in the ebg segment  which more recently has begun to pursue large scale  long term water treatment projects  the company has been utilizing a business model for participating in such projects typically through joint venture project companies in which the company will hold a minority ownership interest 
such project companies are formed to own and operate larger scale desalination  reuse  or other projects in which the company may participate in several ways  including having an ownership interest typically a minority interest in the project company  selling the desalination  reuse  or other treatment system to the project company  and providing operating and maintenance services to the project company once the project facility commences operations 
these projects often exceed million in total cost and may involve multiple equity participants in the project company 
the company s participation in major projects through a minority interest in a project company structure mitigates the risks of engaging in such activities  and also provides the company with potential long term equity income from such investments  because these project companies typically enter into long term concession agreements with the customer entity 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments in affiliated entities  income taxes  goodwill and other long lived assets  pension plans  loss contingencies and derivative instruments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other relevant information and on appropriate assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
revenue recognition for certain contracts involving customized equipment eligible for contract accounting under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain construction type contracts sop  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon an efforts expended method 
the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided are considered in determining the proper accounting for a given contract 
long term  fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs of the total contract can be made 
as a general rule  sales and profits are recognized earlier under the cost to cost method of percentage of completion accounting compared to the completed contract method 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions regarding schedules and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the company s long term contracts  the estimation of cost at completion is complicated and subject to numerous variables 
contract costs include material  labor  subcontracting and other related costs 
assumptions must be made relative to the length of time to complete the contract 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
given the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if underlying circumstances were to change 
the company closely monitors compliance and consistency of application of its critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
in addition  reviews of the status of contracts are performed periodically 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
for contracts involving the sale of equipment to a joint venture or other unconsolidated affiliated entity in which the company has an ownership interest  the extent of revenue and profit recognized while the contract is being performed varies based on the level of equity interest held by the company 
generally  when the company s equity ownership in the affiliated customer is less than  and accounts for such interest on a cost basis  no revenue or profit is eliminated as the contract is being performed 
when the company s equity ownership is between and  provided that the company does not exercise effective control over the affiliated entity  the company recognizes revenue as the contract is being performed but eliminates a portion of the profit equal to the company s equity ownership percentage in the entity 
after construction has been completed and commercial operations have commenced  the resulting eliminated intercompany profit is amortized over the estimated useful life of the equipment owned by the affiliated entity 
when the company s equity ownership exceeds  or in instances where the company effectively controls the affiliated entity  no revenue or profit is recognized on the sale of equipment as the contract is executed  and all of the profit on the contract is eliminated and amortized over the estimated useful life of the equipment after construction has been completed and commercial operations have commenced 
with respect to the company s sale of equipment to desalcott the project company in connection with the trinidad project discussed in this item under financial condition  where the company is a equity owner of desalcott  since the company is considered to have provided all of the cash equity funding for the project either directly or through a loan to the company s local majority partner  equipment revenue earned has been recognized to the extent of costs incurred as the contract is executed  however  all of the profit has been eliminated  and will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the equipment after construction has been completed and commercial operations have commenced 
the revenues and cost of sales to affiliated companies included in the company s consolidated statements of operations reflect the revenue and costs recorded from the sales of equipment to joint ventures or other unconsolidated entities 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sop or with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as appropriate  less the amount of intercompany profit eliminated equal to the company s ownership interest in the affiliated company 
eliminated intercompany profit  as described above  is amortized over the useful life of the equipment placed in service by the affiliated company eg years of the trinidad project  and years for the kuwait project 
the company believes that the amortization of the intercompany profits is not material to the company s financial statements 
the amount of deferred profit at december  was approximately million 
in addition to the construction and sale of customized equipment to its customers  the company also enters into water and other concession agreements under which the company owns and operates desalination or water treatment facilities to produce and supply water to its customers 
under these contracts  where the company remains the owner of the facility or equipment  revenue and profit is recognized as water quantities are sold to the customer or  alternatively  pursuant to a take or pay arrangement if minimum quantities are not purchased 
more specifically  the revenue derived from these contracts is generally recognized based on actual meter readings and agreed upon rates in effect during the term of the contract 
the constructed equipment is capitalized by the company  included in property  plant and equipment  and amortized to cost of sales over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the equipment or the contract term 
for sales of standard products and equipment not governed by sop  such as the sale of instruments and consumer water products  the company follows the guidance provided by sab the company does not recognize revenue unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
it is the company s policy to require an arrangement with its customers  either in the form of a written contract or purchase order containing all of the terms and conditions governing the arrangement  prior to the recognition of revenue 
title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the sale price is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the sale price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms of the arrangement 
if the sales price is not deemed to be fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as the amounts become due from the customer 
the company does not generally offer a right of return on its products and the products are generally not subject to customer acceptance rights 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collectibility of the sales price is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment from the customer 
the company includes shipping and handling costs in revenue and cost of sales 
the company s products are generally subject to warranty  and related costs are provided for in cost of sales when revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation is based upon historical product failure rates and costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates or the costs associated with fixing failures differ from historical rates  adjustments to the warranty liability may be required in the period in which determined 
the company provides lease financing to consumers for the purchase of certain home water treatment systems 
prior to entering into the lease agreement  the company evaluates the creditworthiness of its customer and generally collateralizes the lease receivable with a security interest in the customer s personal residence 
at the time the lease transaction is consummated  the company recognizes revenue for the full amount of the sales value of the equipment and records a lease receivable on its balance sheet 
interest income is recognized by the company over the term of the lease based on the interest rate stated in the lease 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its lease receivables based on its historical loss experience and assessment of prospective risk  and does so through ongoing reviews of its receivables portfolio 
the company provides support services to customers primarily through service contracts and the company primarily recognizes support service revenue ratably over the term of the service contract or as services are rendered 
the company also rents equipment to customers under short term rental agreements 
the company generally invoices customers monthly and recognizes revenue over the rental period based on amounts billed 
the rental equipment is capitalized and depreciated to cost of sales over its estimated useful life 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the adequacy of its reserve for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis through detailed reviews of its receivables portfolio 
estimates are used in determining the company s allowance for bad debts and are based on historical collection experience  current trends including prevailing economic conditions and adverse events that may affect a customer s ability to repay  percentage of accounts receivable by aging category  and other factors such as the financial condition of large customers 
the company makes adjustments to its reserve if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
reserves for doubtful accounts are established through a charge to operations included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
investments in affiliated companies the company consolidates the balance sheet and results of operations of all wholly and majority owned subsidiaries and controlled affiliates 
the company also holds minority investments in certain private companies having complementary or strategic operations in different geographical locations around the world 
these investments are included in investments in affiliates and include investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent a to ownership of the equity securities of the affiliates  the company s proportionate share of the earnings or losses of the affiliates is included in equity income 
with respect to the company s investment in desalcott  the company records of any net loss and of any net income reported by desalcott 
in periods in which desalcott has an accumulated loss as opposed to retained earnings  the company records of any net income of desalcott up to the amount of desalcott s accumulated loss  and of any net income thereafter 
realization of the company s investments in equity securities may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect the company s earnings in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
goodwill and other long lived assets on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company assesses the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could indicate an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired asset or the strategy for its overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are compared to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  the company records an impairment based on the estimated discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by company management to be commensurate with the associated risks 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  depending on the magnitude of the impairment 
in  as summarized in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company recognized impairment losses of approximately million  which included approximately million to reduce the carrying value of assets held for sale in malaysia  million of goodwill write downs  and million associated with the residual value of bleach manufacturing equipment 
goodwill represents the excess acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchase of various entities 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas that requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
in accordance with sfas  amortization of goodwill was discontinued as of january  prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  which generally was a period ranging from to years 
sfas requires the company to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and future forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure  as well as any anticipated cost reductions 
the company completed its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using its best estimate of forecasts for future periods 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of goodwill based on the analysis performed 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company estimates its income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates and which involves an assessment of permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered  and must establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it believes that it is more likely than not any deferred tax asset will not be utilized from future taxable income 
to the extent the company has established a valuation allowance  income tax expense is recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
at any time  the company s income tax expense could be impacted by changes in tax laws  or by administrative actions or court rulings 
the company has taken tax positions in its worldwide corporate income tax filings based on careful interpretations of global statutes  rules  regulations and court decisions that may be applied and interpreted differently by various taxing jurisdictions 
these taxing jurisdictions may or may not challenge the company s application and interpretation of a wide body of tax jurisprudence 
however  the company does not anticipate that any sustained challenge by any taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on its financial position or net income 
the company has elected not to provide tax on certain undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which it considers to be permanently reinvested 
the cumulative amount of such unprovided us taxes was approximately million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
pension plans the company has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of its domestic employees 
the company accounts for its pension plan using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
the company s calculation of pension expense are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and in the demographics of its workforce 
the company s pension income or expense for the plan is computed using actuarial valuations 
the assumptions made by the company relate to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions the company uses 
the assumptions made at year end used to estimate pension income or expense for the following year are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate states the expected future cash flows necessary to satisfy the pension obligations at a present value 
the company uses judgment in selecting these assumptions giving consideration to current market conditions  future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
the company also considers factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
the company s selection of a discount rate represents the market rate of return on high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate would increase the present value of the pension obligation and increase pension expense 
during  the company s review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets  and other factors resulted in reducing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its year end actuarial calculations from to at december  this rate is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which results in an amount that is included in pension income or expense in the company also reduced the discount rate assumption from to at december  these changes  together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets  results in the company projecting an increase in pension expense for of approximately million compared with during and  the company recorded an adjustment in the stockholders equity section of its consolidated balance sheets to reflect a minimum pension liability for its pension plan 
this adjustment is determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation abo for the plan to the fair value of the plan s assets 
the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets  after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan  must be recorded as a minimum pension liability  with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset  if appropriate  and a reduction to stockholders equity  consistent with sfas the after tax adjustment related to the company s recording a minimum pension liability in did not impact earnings  but reduced stockholders equity by million 
this adjustment is computed each year at december and could potentially reverse in the future if financial markets improve and interest rates increase  or could potentially increase if financial market performance and interest rates continue to decline 
loss contingencies the company is subject to certain claims and litigation including proceedings under government laws and regulations and commercial disputes relating to its operations  including ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business 
see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
management reviews and determines which liabilities  if any  arising from these claims and litigations could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
loss contingency liabilities are recorded for these contingencies based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside counsel when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
these liabilities may change in the future due to new developments relating to each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy 
derivative instruments the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas in the first quarter of sfas requires all derivatives to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company conducts business in a number of foreign countries  with certain transactions denominated in local currencies 
the purpose of the company s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign denominated monetary assets and anticipated cash flows 
the terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for purposes of presentation within the consolidated statement of cash flows  derivative gains and losses are presented within cash provided by operating activities 
the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposures associated with a portion of its forecasted revenue transactions 
these derivative instruments are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges 
all outstanding derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and changes in their fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the underlying forecasted transaction occurs 
once the underlying forecasted transaction is realized  the gain or loss from the derivative designated as a hedge of the transaction is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the statement of operations in the related revenue caption 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be reclassified to selling  general and administrative expense in the statement of operations in the then current period 
no amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to selling  general and administrative expense during  and the company s cash flow hedges generally mature within two years or less 
the company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposures associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are designated as foreign currency fair value hedges 
the derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and period end changes in fair value are recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the statement of operations 
since the company is using foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposures  the changes in the value of the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
hedge effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis 
any ineffective portion of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recognized in current earnings in selling  general and administrative expense 
the ineffective portion of the derivatives consists of discounts or premiums on forward contracts and gains or losses associated with differences between actual and forecasted amounts 
in any instance in which the designated hedged item matures  is terminated  or  in the case of an anticipated transaction  is deemed unlikely to occur  the related derivative contract is closed and any gain or loss is immediately recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in selling  general and administrative expense 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  the company reported consolidated revenues of million and net income of million in  compared to consolidated revenues of million and net income of million in results for included the operations of the aqua cool pure bottled water business aqua cool business  which was divested on december   as well as the results of the company s majority owned malaysian subsidiary  ionics enersave enersave which was divested in may revenues total company revenues of million for decreased million or from revenues of million for the revenues of the aqua cool business represented million  or of the decrease  and the revenues of the company s majority owned malaysian subsidiary represented million  or of the decrease 
ebg revenues of million in decreased million  or  compared to revenues of million in the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to reduced revenues from the zero liquid discharge zld business  primarily as a result of the company s business strategy to not pursue the civil construction scope on zld projects 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in ebg s water supply business in spain  as well as increases in the revenues of the company s italian subsidiary 
uwg revenues of million decreased million  or  compared to revenues of million for the revenues associated with the company s majority owned malaysian subsidiary  which was divested in may  amounted to million in and million in  and accordingly represented of the revenue decrease 
the additional decrease in revenues relates primarily to the continued downturn in the microelectronics sector 
cwg revenues totaled million in compared to revenues of million in  representing a decrease of million or 
the revenues of the aqua cool business of million represented of the decrease in revenues 
cwg revenue levels were also adversely impacted by lower sales of automobile windshield wash solution and consumer bleach products due to the loss of several customers 
additionally  cwg experienced lower demand for home water treatment equipment as a result of the general downturn in the domestic economy 
ibg revenues of million in increased million  or  compared to revenues of million in the increase in revenues primarily resulted from increased sales volume to the pharmaceutical industry driven by regulatory requirements in that industry  as well as continued growth in recurring sales of the company s after market products 
revenues from sales to affiliated companies of million in decreased million or compared to revenues from affiliated companies of million in the decrease in revenues from affiliated companies primarily resulted from lower equipment sales to the trinidad joint venture company  desalination company of trinidad and tobago ltd 
desalcott  as a result of the substantial completion of the first four out of the five construction phases of the desalination facility in early the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of equipment in the second half of to the kuwaiti joint venture company  utilities development company udc  for the kuwait reuse project 
the company has entered into a number of large contracts  which are generally categorized as either equipment sale contracts or build  own and operate boo contracts 
the company believes that the remaining duration on its existing sale of equipment contracts ranges from less than one year to three years and the remaining duration on its existing boo contracts ranges from one year to years 
the time to completion of any of these contracts  however  is subject to a number of variables  including the nature and provisions of the contract and the industry being served 
historically  as contracts are completed  the company has entered into new contracts with the same or other customers 
in the past  the completion of any one particular contract has not had a material effect on the company s business  results of operations or cash flows 
cost of sales the company s total cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in and in the resulting gross margin increased to in compared to in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased in the ebg  uwg  and ibg segments and increased in the cwg segment 
ebg s cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue from to related to the elimination of losses incurred on the civil construction portion of zld projects that were incurred in additionally  the improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is attributable to a shift in product mix from lower margin capital equipment sales to higher margin water supply and other products 
uwg s cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue primarily reflects the elimination of losses associated with projects in australia  improved operating results in the group s asian operations  and the reduction of losses associated with the company s majority owned malaysian subsidiary  which was divested in may cwg s cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in the increase in the cost of sales as a percentage of revenue compared to cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the divestiture of the company s aqua cool business on december   as well as lower margin levels in both the home water and elite consumer product lines 
the elite consumer products line continued to face pricing pressure due to increased competition while home water product line margins were negatively impacted by the continued decline in the domestic economy 
ibg s cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in  primarily reflecting absorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of higher sales volume along with cost reductions in the service businesses 
cost of sales to affiliated companies as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in the decrease in was primarily due to lower revenues from sales to desalcott  where  for accounting purposes  all profit on sales to desalcott is being deferred  and the increase in equipment sales to udc  where the company defers profit equal to its equity ownership in udc  and will subsequently recognize the deferred profit over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
operating expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly during compared to the company currently expects to continue to invest in new products and technologies at approximately the same level as in prior years 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in from million in the elimination of selling  general and administrative expenses relating to the aqua cool business resulting from the divestiture of the business on december   as well as the divestiture of the company s majority owned malaysian subsidiary in the second quarter of  and the cessation of goodwill amortization amounted to approximately million 
these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with the company s european operations  primarily france  higher than normal professional service fees related primarily to the company s restatement of its interim financial statements for the first and second quarters of  increased provisions for doubtful accounts  and other general increases 
interest income and interest expense interest income totaled million in and million in interest expense  net of capitalized interest of million  was million in and million in the increase in interest income in compared to reflects the investment of proceeds resulting from the divestiture of the aqua cool business on december  additionally  a portion of the proceeds from the disposition of the aqua cool business were utilized to reduce domestic short term borrowings which resulted in lower interest expense of million in compared to million in equity income the company s proportionate share of the earnings and losses of affiliated companies in which it holds a minority equity interest is included in equity income 
equity income amounted to million in and million in the company s equity income is derived primarily from its equity interest in a mexican joint venture company which owns two water treatment plants in mexico  its equity interest in desalcott  its equity interests in several joint ventures in the middle east which engage in bottled water distribution  and to a lesser extent from its other equity investments in affiliated companies

except in situations that are negotiated with a specific joint venture entity as discussed below  the company has no other commitment to provide for the joint venture s working capital or other cash needs 
in addition  the joint venture entity typically obtains third party debt financing for a substantial portion of the project s total capital requirements 
in these situations  the company is typically not responsible for the repayment of the indebtedness incurred by the joint venture entity 
in connection with certain joint venture projects  the company may also enter into contracts for the supply and installation of the company s equipment during the construction of the project  for the operation and maintenance of the facility once it begins operation  or both

principal repayment is due in equal installments commencing on april  and continuing semiannually thereafter 
the loan matures and is payable in full on april  the loan is secured by a security interest in the shares of desalcott owned by hkes and purchased with the borrowed funds  which is subordinate to the security interest in those shares in favor of the trinidad bank that provided the construction financing for desalcott

the company does not believe resolution of these matters will have a material impact on its financial position 
desalcott has received proposals for new long term debt financing  including a term sheet and a draft term loan agreement from the trinidad bank which provided the bridge loan  and is currently negotiating the terms of the financing 
such new long term debt financing may not be completed on terms acceptable to desalcott  or at all 
moreover  although the trinidad bank that made the bridge loan to desalcott has not required repayment of the bridge loan  which matured on september   pending completion of the long term debt financing  there can be no assurance that the bank will not exercise its rights and foreclose on its collateral  in which event the company s equity investment in  and receivable from  desalcott as well as the loan receivables from hkes would all be at risk

risks and uncertainties the company may face significant risks from its international operations the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from international operations  which involve a number of additional risks  including the following o impact of possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states  o longer receivables collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  o exposure to foreign taxation  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o transportation delays  o foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and o political and economic instability and acts of terrorism 
in addition  the kuwait wastewater treatment project in which the company is an equity participant and equipment supplier  and will also be a participant in plant operation  is subject to the risk of hostilities as a result of the current war with iraq 
although the company has the protection of force majeure provisions in its contracts which excuse the company from performance obligations in such circumstances  hostilities may damage or delay completion of the project  delaying the company s expected receipt of income from the project 
the company may face significant risks from participating in large own and operate projects there has been a worldwide trend in the desalination and water treatment markets towards large scale own and operate projects 
the company has made bids on a number of large scale desalination and other water treatment projects in a number of countries  under a business structure in which the company usually through a subsidiary will be an equity participant  together with one or more local partners  in a project company which will own and operate the water treatment facility that is the subject of the bid 
the project company  if its bid is successful  typically will enter into a concession agreement with a government entity or utility for the provision of water or water treatment services over a defined long period at a defined price  subject to escalation 
the project company is usually responsible for obtaining construction and long term financing for the project  and bears the risk of being able to do so once the concession agreement is awarded 
under this project structure  the company may also sell water treatment equipment to the project company and in addition may provide certain operation and maintenance services in connection with the long term operation of the facility 
when these projects are located overseas  such as the trinidad desalination project  the company either directly or as a result of its equity interest in the project company  is exposed to the risks inherent in international operations  described above 
in addition  the company s equity investment in such projects is subject to risk that the entity purchasing the water or the services being rendered will have the necessary financial wherewithal over the term of the contract to continue to make payments to the project company  and the risk that the project company s bid properly reflected long term operating costs so as to be able to operate at a profit over the term of the concession agreement 
the company has only limited protection for its proprietary technology the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s success depends in part on its ability to obtain new patents and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering its products 
the company intends to continue to seek patents on its inventions when appropriate 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that any new patent applications will be approved  that any patents that may issue will protect the company s intellectual property or that any issued patents will not be challenged by third parties or will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to the company 
other parties may independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to the company 
the company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent the misappropriation of its intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the company may become subject to infringement claims although the company does not believe that its products infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  the company has in the past been subject to infringement claims and third parties might assert infringement claims against the company or its customers in the future 
furthermore  the company may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of its proprietary rights or to establish the validity of its proprietary rights and has one such suit pending see item of this annual report on form k 
litigation  either as plaintiff or defendant  would cause the company to incur substantial costs and divert management resources 
any litigation  regardless of the outcome  could harm the company s business 
the company has many competitors and may not be able to compete effectively the company experiences competition from a variety of sources with respect to virtually all of its products and services  although the company does not know of any single entity that competes with it across the full range of its products  systems and services 
competition in the markets served by the company is based on a number of factors  including price  technology  applications experience  know how  availability of financing  reputation  product warranties  reliability  service and distribution 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have greater name recognition and substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than does the company  and there has been a trend toward consolidation on the part of competitors in many of the markets serviced by the company 
these greater resources could  for example  allow the company s competitors to develop technology  products and services superior to those of the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the company may not be able to develop the new products or acquire the rights to new products necessary to remain competitive the water purification industry is characterized by ongoing technological developments and changing customer requirements 
as a result  the company s success and continued growth depend  in part  on its ability to develop or acquire rights to  and successfully introduce into the marketplace  enhancements of existing products or new products that incorporate technological advances  meet customer requirements and respond to products developed by competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing or acquiring such rights to products on a timely basis or that such products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
the company may not be able to adapt to changes in technology and government regulation fast enough to remain competitive the water purification industry is characterized by changing technology  competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements  each of which influences the demand for the company s products and services 
changes in legislative  regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of the company s purification products and processes obsolete 
acceptance of new products may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products successfully on a timely basis will be a significant factor in its ability to grow and to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary to remain competitive or that certain of the company s products will not become obsolete 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in development or failure of products to operate properly 
a portion of the company s sales is dependent upon its customers spending cycles for capital equipment the sale of capital equipment within the water purification industry is cyclical and influenced by various economic factors including interest rates and general fluctuations of the business cycle 
the equipment business group and ultrapure water group each derive a significant portion of its revenue from the sale of capital equipment 
while the company sells capital equipment to customers in diverse industries and in domestic and international markets  cyclicality of capital equipment sales and general economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
for example  in the past several years  conditions in the microelectronics industry have negatively affected sales of equipment by the ultrapure water group to customers in that industry 
the company must comply with significant environmental regulations  which can be difficult and expensive the company is subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in certain of its manufacturing processes 
although the company believes that its activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any failure to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject the company to significant future liabilities 
in addition  there is no assurance that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will not result in remediation or other significant liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations 
higher interest rates may hurt the company financially the company engages in short term and long term borrowing  some of which is subject to interest rates that float with us prime rates or foreign rates 
this borrowing subjects the company to the risk that interest rates may increase significantly and increase the cost of such borrowing 
if the company is unable to continue to hire and retain skilled technical and scientific personnel  it will have trouble developing products the company s success depends largely upon the continued service of its management and scientific staff and its ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled scientific  management and marketing personnel 
the company faces significant competition for such personnel from other companies  research and academic institutions  government and other organizations which may better be able to attract such personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the company s inability to hire and retain personnel who have technical and scientific backgrounds could materially adversely affect its product development efforts and business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative instruments in certain instances  the company enters into foreign exchange contracts including forwards  options and swaps 
the company s policy is to enter into such contracts only for the purpose of managing exposures and not for speculative purposes 
the us dollar euro options contracts previously held by the company s italian subsidiary which did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment were closed in the second quarter of on december   the company entered into a series of usdollar euro forward contracts with the intent of offsetting the foreign exchange risk associated with forecasted cash flows related to an ongoing project 
because the contracts were executed on the last day of the year  the fair market value of the contracts is zero 
in future periods the fair market value of the contracts will be recorded in either the current assets or current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 
end of period changes in the market value of the contracts will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to sell us dollars to hedge these currency exposures was million 
a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would change the fair value by approximately million 
in the company also entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to hedge the balance sheet exposure related to an intercompany loan 
the fair market value of the contract  which was immaterial  was recorded in the other current assets section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the end of period change in the fair market value of the contract which was immaterial  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
market risk the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio of cash equivalents is subject to interest rate risk fluctuations  but the company believes the risk is not material due to the short term nature of these investments 
at december   the company had million of short term debt and million of long term debt outstanding 
the major portion of this debt has fixed interest rates and is not subject to risk arising from interest rate variability 
a hypothetical increase of in interest rates for a one year period would result in additional interest expense that would not be material in the aggregate 
the company s net foreign exchange currency gain was million in compared with a loss of million in and million in the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that the operations of its international subsidiaries are primarily conducted in their respective local currencies 
also  in certain situations  the company enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations
