management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations changes in financial position comparison of financial position at december  and december  our assets increased by million from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase in our assets is primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans receivable  partially offset by a million decrease in assets available for sale 
in addition  we increased investment in office properties and equipment by million  primarily for new office sites  but also for upgraded data processing equipment 
interest bearing deposits with the fhlb increased by million  while all other assets increased by million 
funds for the increase in assets were provided primarily by an increase in deposits of million  and an increase in borrowed funds of million 
the increase in loans and deposits reflects our branch expansion in our market area 
in addition  the increase in our deposits primarily reflects the growth of our interest bearing checking accounts and non interest bearing checking accounts  which increased by million and million  respectively 
slightly offsetting these increases was a decrease in stockholders equity of million  which resulted from repurchases of company common stock in the amount of million  as well as dividends paid to stockholders  partially offset by million in net income 
comparison of financial position at december  and december  our assets increased by million from billion at december  to billion at december  the increase in our assets is primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans receivable offset by a million decrease in cash and assets available for sale 
in addition  we increased investment in office properties and equipment  primarily for new office sites  but also for upgraded data processing equipment  by million  while all other assets increased by million 
funds for the increase in assets were provided primarily by an increase in deposits of million and an increase in advances from the federal home loan bank and other borrowed funds of million 
the increase in loans and deposits reflects our branch expansion in our market area 
in may   we converted from a mutual holding company structure to a fully public company 
as a result of this transaction  we raised million from the sale of company common stock 
stockholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million from december  this increase consisted of net income for the year of million  a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes of million  which was partially offset by dividends declared of million and the previously mentioned million public offering of common stock 
results of operations our earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balance of interest earning assets compared to interest bearing liabilities 
our earnings are also affected by our level of operating expenses and service charges as well as other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  and deposit insurance premiums 
results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share of for the year ended december  this compares to net income of million  or basic earnings per share of  for the year ended december  the increase in net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to  is due to a number of factors 
while interest income decreased to million in from million in  interest expense also declined in to million from million in  resulting in a increase in net interest income  before provision for loan losses  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in our provision for loan losses decreased to million in  compared to million in other income for the year ended december  improved to million from million in our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or to million from million for the year ended december  included in operating expenses for was a one time charge of million relating to our computer system conversion 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  this was offset by a decline in the average yield of these assets to in  from in the decline in average yield on our interest earning assets resulted  primarily  from the rapidly declining interest rate environment we experienced in and interest income from mortgage loans increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in the average balance of mortgage loans from billion to billion  which was offset by a modest decline in the yield on these assets to from 
interest income on consumer and commercial business loans increased slightly by  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the average balance of consumer and commercial business loans increased by million  or  from million to million  this was offset by a significant decline in average yield on these assets from in to in our average balance of mortgage backed securities declined from million in to million in as we continue to allocate repayments on these assets to higher yielding loans 
as a result of this decline and a decline in the average yield on mortgage backed securities from in to in  income from mortgage backed securities declined million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest income on securities decreased by million from million in to million in while the average balance of these assets increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   we incurred a significant decline in the average yield on these assets from for to for resulting in a decrease in interest income from these securities 
interest income on other investments  which consists of income from our investment in fhlb stock and from interest earning deposits  declined by  from million in to million in although the average balance of these assets increased by million  or  the average yield declined from in to in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense is attributable to a decline in the average cost of our deposits from in to in the average balance of our deposits increased by million during  from billion for the year ended december  to billion for the year ended december   reflecting an increase in savings and checking accounts  offset by a decline in higher cost certificate of deposit balances of million 
the increase in interest expense on borrowed funds of  resulted from an increase in the average balance of borrowed funds from million in to million in  however this impact was partially offset by a decline in the average cost of these borrowings from to 
net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million from million for to million in the increase reflects an increase in our net interest spread to in from in the ratio of our average interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased by  from million in to million in our total allowance for loan losses as of december  was million  and is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date which were both probable and reasonably estimable 
at december   our ratio of non performing loans to total loans was 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our loan portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of computing our regulatory risk based capital 
we conduct a monthly review of our loan portfolio  including impaired loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate valuation allowances 
as we are increasing our origination of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  and such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods 
other income 
other income increased by million or  to million in from million in million of this increase was from service charges on deposit accounts  which resulted from the growth of core deposits consisting of all deposits except for certificates of deposit from of total deposits at december  to of total deposits at december  fees from other banking services  which include insurance annuity sales  trust income and appraisal services  increased by million 
these amounts were slightly offset by declines in gains on loan and securities sales of  and miscellaneous income of operating expense 
operating expense for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million related to compensation and benefits  million related to occupancy and equipment  and other expense increased by million 
with respect to the increase in compensation and benefit costs  million resulted from stock based compensation  including the management recognition program approved by stockholders in may employee benefits increased by million  primarily for health and pension costs 
the remaining increase of million included normal  annual compensation increases and compensation costs relating to the increase in full time equivalent employees  principally in the areas of customer service and lending  from at december  to at december  the increase in occupancy and equipment expense resulted principally from increased depreciation  maintenance and taxes related to our ongoing branch expansion activities as well as the computer system upgrade  which occurred in november of the remaining increase in all other expense of million   of the increase was for telecommunications and postage expense and  was passed through to our appraisal subsidiary  both of which cost increases contributed to increased loan production and increases in other income 
income taxes 
our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december  reflects our current rate applied to income before taxes 
results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share of 
for the year ended december  this compares to net income of million  or basic earnings per share of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income of  for the year ended december   as compared to  is due to a number of factors 
interest income increased to million in from million in  while interest expense declined in to million from million in this resulted in a increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses to million for the year ended december   compared to million in primarily as a result of the bank s continuing expansion of its commercial mortgage  consumer and commercial business portfolios  our provision for loan losses increased to million in  compared to million in while other income for the year ended december  improved to million from million in  other income for the year ended december  included million of non recurring income received as a result of john hancock financial s conversion from a mutual to a stock insurance company 
our operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or to million from million for the year ended december  included in operating expenses for was a one time charge of million relating to our computer system conversion 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  this was largely offset by a decline in the average yield of these assets to in  from in the decline in average yield on our interest earning assets resulted  primarily  from the rapidly declining interest rate environment we experienced in interest income from mortgage loans increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in the average balance of mortgage loans from billion to billion  which was offset by a modest decline in the yield on these assets to from

as a result of this decline and a decline in the average yield on these assets from in to in  income from mortgage backed securities declined million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest income on securities increased by million from million in to million in  as the average balance of these assets increased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we incurred a decline in yield on these assets from for to for interest income on other investments  which consists of income from our investment in fhlb stock and from interest earning deposits  declined by  from million in to million in although the average balance of these assets increased by million  or  the average yield declined from in to in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense is principally attributable to a decline in the average cost of our deposits from in to in the average balance of our deposits increased by million during  from billion for the year ended december  to over billion for the year ended december   despite a decline in higher costing certificate of deposit balances of million 
the decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds of million resulted from a decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds from million in to million in  together with a decline in the average cost of these borrowings from to 
net interest income 
our net interest income increased by million from million for to million in this increase was caused by a decrease in our net interest spread to for from in  offset by an increase in the ratio of our average interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities from in to in this resulted in an increase in our net interest margin from in to in the improvement in this ratio is principally attributable to funds received in connection with our stock offering in may the increase in our spread was mainly the result of the growth in our lower costing core deposits  together with the repricing of our certificates of deposit in a lower interest rate environment 
these benefits were partially offset by a decline in the yield on our interest earning assets  also principally due to the lower interest rate environment 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses increased by  from million in to million in the main reason for this increase is our continued increase in production of commercial business  consumer and commercial real estate loans 
our total allowance for loan losses as of december  of million is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date which were both probable and reasonably estimable 
at december   our ratio of non performing loans to total loans was our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  allowances for loan losses are based on management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we provide both general valuation allowances for unspecified  probable losses and specific valuation allowances for known losses in our loan portfolio 
general valuation allowances are added to our capital for purposes of computing our regulatory risk based capital 
we conduct a monthly review of our loan portfolio  including impaired loans  to determine whether any loans require classification or the establishment of appropriate valuation allowances 
as we are increasing our origination of commercial business loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  and such loans traditionally have a higher risk of loss than residential mortgage loans  our provision for loan losses is likely to increase in future periods 
other income 
other income increased slightly  by  during the year ended december  to million from million in other income for the year ended december  included million from the receipt and sale of common stock received as a result of the conversion of john hancock financial from a mutual to a stock insurance company 
million was included in miscellaneous income for the receipt and million was reflected in gain on sale of investments for the sale of this common stock 
fee income on deposit accounts increased by million  primarily as a result of growth in checking accounts  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  income from fees for other banking services  which include insurance and annuity sales  as well as trust and appraisal fee income  increased by million from million in to million for the year ended december  operating expense 
operating expense increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  of this increase  million is attributable to employee compensation and benefits 
this represents an increase of of such costs 
the number of full time equivalent employees increased by persons   to at december  increased commissions and related compensation of  were incurred to produce the increase in other income 
health care costs increased by  while pension costs  principally attributable to our defined benefit plan  increased by  effective january   new employees were no longer covered by the defined benefit pension plan  but  rather  by a defined contribution plan 
the remainder of the increase is mainly attributable to paying a full year s compensation to employees hired during the year ended december   a increase in number  together with normal salary increases 
occupancy and equipment expense increased by million 
we incurred a full year s depreciation on the building and furnishings of our corporate headquarters for the year ended december   whereas the year included only a partial year of such expense  as we began occupying the facility in mid we opened two new offices and began depreciation on data processing upgrades relating to our computer conversion 
miscellaneous expense increased by million 
of this amount  million related to a one time charge to change data processing service bureaus   was incurred as we wrote off obsolete signage due to our bank s name change and we absorbed an additional  in loan production costs for consumer loans 
our telephone costs increased by  as we separated this service from our data processing contract to avoid additional mark ups on this service and we incurred additional  on going  state franchise fees and nasdaq costs of  as a result of our conversion to a stock company from a mutual holding company

as stated above  the majority of our interest bearing liabilities and nearly all of our interest earning assets are held by fidelity federal bank trust and  therefore  nearly all of our interest rate risk is at the fidelity federal bank trust level 
we monitor interest rate risk by various methods  including gap analysis and analyzing changes in market value of portfolio equity mvpe which analysis  compared to similar calculations performed by the office of thrift supervision  are reviewed with the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
mvpe is generally defined as the difference between the market value of our interest rate sensitive assets and the market value of our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we use an internal model that generates estimates of our mvpe over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model calculates mvpe essentially by discounting the cash flows from our assets and liabilities to present value using current market rates  and adjusting those discount rates accordingly for various interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth our estimated internal calculations of mvpe as of december   for instantaneous and parallel shifts in the yield curve in basis point increments up and down 
due to the low interest rate environment that existed at december   an analysis of a basis point downward shift in interest rates is not shown 
changes in rates market value of portfolio equity basis points amount change change dollars in thousands bp bp bp fidelity federal bank trust s internal calculation of mvpe at december  shows the negative effects of rate caps and floors in certain interest earning assets and particularly interest bearing liabilities in both rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
as shown in the previous table  mvpe was negatively affected in both rising and falling rate scenarios as a result of these interest rate caps and floors 
in preparing the mvpe table above  we have estimated prepayment rates for our loans ranging from to  depending on the interest rate scenario and loan type 
these rates are management s best estimate based on prior repayment experience 
decay rates for liabilities indicate an assumed annual rate at which an interest bearing liability will be withdrawn in favor of an account with a more favorable interest rate 
decay rates have been assumed for interest bearing checking accounts  passbook and money market deposits 
the purpose of this analysis was to obtain an estimate of the actual deposit balance trends over various interest rate scenarios during the previous five years and to use that data to provide a forecast of future balance trends over various interest rate scenarios 
the following decay rates were used for this analysis and the gap analysis which follows 
within months months through year year through years years through years years through years over years interest bearing checking accounts passbook  club accounts money market deposit accounts the above assumptions are estimates of annual percentages based on remaining balances 
although management believes these deposit decay rates are a reasonable estimate of future deposit trends based on past performance  they should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced by us in any given period 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in mvpe requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect how actual yields and costs respond to changes in market rates 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
also  the changes in the contractual interest rates of our assets and liabilities may not occur at the same time as changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the assets 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
management also has made estimates of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable 
however  because there is no quoted market for many of the assets and liabilities  there can be no assurance that the fair values presented would be indicative of the value negotiated in an actual sale 
while the above table provides an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  it is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of market changes on our mvpe  as actual results may vary 
at december   we were not required by the office of thrift supervision to hold additional risk based capital for interest rate risk purposes 
the company also monitors the matching of its assets and liabilities through gap analysis 
gap analysis attempts to measure the difference between the amount of interest earning assets expected to mature or reprice within a specific time period compared to the amount of interest bearing liabilities expected to mature or reprice within that period 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
an interest rate sensitive gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities exceeds the amount of interest earnings assets maturing or repricing within a specified period of time 
gap analysis involves the use of numerous assumptions  as does mvpe 
generally  company s with a positive gap can expect net interest income to increase during periods of rising interest rates and decline in periods of falling interest rates 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as shown in the following table  the company s cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap at december  was a positive 
within three months four to twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years dollars in thousands interest earning assets residential mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate commercial mortgage loans fixed rate adjustable rate other loans fixed rate adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate adjustable rate municipal bonds and government and agency securities fixed rate other interest earning assets adjustable total interest bearing liabilities deposits checking and funds transfer accounts passbook accounts money market accounts certificate accounts borrowings total excess deficiency of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities cumulative excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities as a percent of total assets adjustable and floating rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due 
fixed rate assets are included in the periods in which they are scheduled to be repaid based on scheduled amortization 
in both cases  amounts are adjusted to reflect estimated prepayments 
for this table  all loans and mortgage backed securities were assigned a twenty percent prepayment rate 
balances are shown net of loans in process and are not adjusted for premiums  discounts  reserves and unearned fees 
all of the company s non certificate deposits are generally subject to immediate withdrawal 
however  management considers a significant portion of these accounts to be core deposits having longer effective maturities based on the company s actual retention of such deposit accounts in various interest rate environments 
in the year  we contracted with a third party consultant to perform an analysis of the core deposit accounts to obtain an estimate of the actual deposit balance trends over various interest rates scenarios over the previous five years 
we then used the information obtained to provide a forecast of future balance trends 
management does not feel that the deposit trends have changed materially since we then used the information obtained to provide a forecast of future balance trends 
management does not feel that the deposit trends have changed materially since certificate accounts and borrowings are assumed to have no prepayments and are shown in the period in which they contractually mature 
certain shortcomings are inherent in any methodology used to calculate interest rate sensitivity 
the asset prepayment speed and deposit decay rate assumptions are based on past experience and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that may be experienced in any given period 
in the event of changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal would possibly deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the above table 
also  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in recent years our policy has been to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and by originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments 
however  particularly in a low interest rate environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
we do not solicit high rate jumbo certificates or brokered funds 
liquidity and capital resources fidelity federal bank trust is required to maintain liquid assets at levels considered safe and sound by the office of thrift supervision 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and during the months ended december   and  respectively 
our liquidity ratio averaged  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows  pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans  repay our borrowings and loan to fund commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
short term interest bearing deposits with the federal home loan bank of atlanta amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
other assets qualifying for liquidity purposes at december   and  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from our operating  financing  and investing activities  see consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and increases in deposit accounts  along with advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of atlanta which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
we borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta in order to reduce interest rate risk  and for liquidity purposes 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments of million to originate and or purchase mortgage loans 
this amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year  totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with fidelity federal bank trust  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher 
pension plans 
the company maintains a qualified defined benefit plan the qualified plan  which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to january  and an unfunded supplemental retirement plan to provide additional benefits to executives selected for the plan that are in excess of amounts permitted to be paid under the provisions of tax law to participants in the qualified plan 
the company also sponsors a non qualified defined benefit plan for its directors 
our pension costs for all pension plans approximated million and million for and respectively  and is calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets of 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries and our investment advisors  including their review of asset class return expectations from respected sources and authorities 
we also evaluated the long term rate of expected inflation 
projected returns by these sources are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical returns in comparison to various market indices 
our expected long term rate of return is based on a target asset allocation of in equities and in fixed income 
we adopted this change in target allocation in early previously  our target allocation was equities and in fixed income investments 
we expect a long term rate of return on equities of and a long term rate of return on fixed income investments of 
due to market fluctuations and distributions  our actual asset allocation as of december  was in equities and in fixed income 
we periodically rebalance the actual asset allocation to match the target asset allocation 
we believe this is a reasonable long term rate of return for our qualified plan assets  despite the weak market performance of recent years including the loss for we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust as necessary 
we base our determination of pension cost on the market value of assets without adjustments or smoothing to reduce year to year volatility 
actuarial gains and losses are recognized into pension cost  to the extent they exceed the amount allowed in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  that can be excluded in determining the amount to be amortized the corridor 
the amount of gain and loss in excess of the corridor is amortized over the remaining average expected working lifetime of plan participants  which was years for as of december   we had cumulative actuarial losses of million that had not yet been recognized into pension cost 
the discount rate we utilize for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bond yields 
we use moody s aa bond index and merrill lynch s corporate years high quality bond index as of our measurement date in determining our discount rate each year 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from as of december  to as of december  lowering the expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets by from to would have increased our fiscal pension cost by  lowering the discount rate and salary increase assumptions by would have increased our fiscal pension cost by  the value of our qualified plan assets increased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns and declining discount rates have reduced the overfunding in our qualified plan  net of accumulated benefit obligations from  at december  to an underfunding of  at december  as a result of this decline in funded status of our qualified plan  we expect that based on our actuarial assumptions that we will continue to make cash contributions to the qualified plan in the range of million for at least the next three years 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of fidelity bankshares  inc and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of fidelity federal bank trust s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of fidelity federal bank trust are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on fidelity federal bank trust s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as changes in the price of goods and services
