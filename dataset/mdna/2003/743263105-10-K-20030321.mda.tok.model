item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review the risk factors section and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
results of operations for as compared to and as compared to in this section  earnings and the factors affecting earnings are discussed 
the discussion begins with a general overview  then separately discusses earnings by business segment 
overview progress energy  inc progress energy or the company is a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of puhca  as amended 
progress energy and its subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory provisions of puhca 
progress energy was formed as a result of the reorganization of carolina power light company cp l into a holding company structure on june  all shares of common stock of cp l were exchanged for an equal number of shares of cp l energy  inc  the newly created holding company 
on december   cp l energy  inc changed its name to progress energy  inc the company acquired florida progress corporation fpc on november  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements only reflect fpc s operations subsequent to november  through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries  cp l and florida power corporation florida power  progress energy is primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina  south carolina and florida 
through the progress ventures business segment  progress energy is involved in nonregulated generation operations  natural gas exploration and production  coal fuel extraction  manufacturing and delivery  and energy marketing and trading activities 
through the rail services business segment  progress energy engages in various rail and railcar related services 
through the other business segment  progress energy engages in other nonregulated business areas including telecommunications and holding company operations 
effective january   cp l  florida power and progress ventures  inc pvi began doing business under the names progress energy carolinas  inc  progress energy florida  inc  and progress energy ventures  inc  respectively 
the legal names of these entities have not changed and there is no restructuring of any kind related to the name change 
the current corporate and business unit structure remains unchanged 
in  the operations of north carolina natural gas corporation ncng  previously reported in the other segment  were reclassified to discontinued operations and therefore were not included in the results from continuing operations during the periods reported 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for discussion of the planned divestiture 
progress energy is an integrated energy company located principally in the southeast region of the united states 
the company has more than  megawatts of generation capacity and serves approximately million electric and natural gas customers in portions of north carolina  south carolina and florida 
cp l s and florida power s utility operations are complementary  as cp l has a summer peaking demand  while florida power has a winter peaking demand 
in addition  cp l s greater proportion of commercial and industrial customers combined with florida power s greater proportion of residential customers creates a more balanced customer base 
the company is dedicated to delivering reliable  competitively priced energy 
in  progress energy s net income was million  a decrease from million in income from continuing operations was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in net income in is primarily due to o million of after tax impairments and other charges progress telecom  caronet and interpath communications  inc  estimated impairment on assets held for sale railcar ltd  and discontinued operations ncng in  o the rate case settlement of florida power one time retroactive rate reduction of million after tax combined with a prospective rate reduction  o increased operating expenses of million after tax at cp l related to the ice storm in december  and o increased benefit costs and a lower pension credit  primarily at the electric utilities 
partially offsetting these items were o continued retail customer growth and usage including weather impacts at the electric utilities  o lower depreciation expense related to the florida rate case settlement  o million of after tax impairments and other charges attributable to strategic resource solutions corp 
srs and interpath communications  inc interpath in  o impact of the change in market value of contingent value obligations of million  o lower interest charges primarily at cp l  and o the elimination of goodwill amortization in basic earnings per share from net income decreased from per share in to per share in due to the factors outlined above and also from an increase in the number of shares outstanding resulting from the common stock issuances in and see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s common stock 
net income in rose million or when compared to the net income of million 
the increase in net income in is due primarily to a full year of fpc s operations being included in the results  as fpc contributed net income of million for the year ended december  other factors contributing to the increase in net income in included increases in tax credits from progress energy s share of synthetic fuel facilities  continued customer growth at the electric utilities and decreases in depreciation expense related to cp l s accelerated cost recovery program 
partially offsetting these increases were impairment and other after tax charges totaling million  primarily attributable to srs and the company s investment in interpath  as well as increases in interest expense  goodwill amortization related to the fpc acquisition and the impact of unfavorable weather 
basic earnings per share decreased from per share in to per share in due to the factors outlined above and also from an increase in the number of shares outstanding resulting from the fpc acquisition and an additional common stock issuance in august electric segments the electric segments are primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina by cp l electric  and since november   in portions of florida by florida power electric 
cp l electric serves an area of approximately  square miles  with a population of more than million 
as of december   cp l electric provided electricity to approximately million customers 
florida power electric serves an area of approximately  square miles  with a population of more than million 
as of december   florida power electric provided electricity to approximately million customers 
the operating results of both electric utilities are primarily influenced by customer demand for electricity  the ability to control costs and regulatory return on equity 
annual demand for electricity is based on the number of customers and their annual usage  with usage largely impacted by weather 
in addition  the current economic conditions in the service territories may impact the annual demand for electricity 
cp l electric cp l electric contributed net income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
included in these amounts are wholesale energy marketing activities and immaterial trading activities  which are managed by progress ventures on behalf of cp l electric  that contributed net income of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
revenues cp l s electric revenues for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in millions customer class change change residential    commercial industrial governmental total retail revenues    wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues    cp l s electric energy sales for  and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change residential    commercial    industrial    governmental    total retail energy sales    wholesale    unbilled total mwh sales    cp l s electric revenues increased million from to during  residential and commercial sales reflected continued growth in the number of customers served by cp l electric  with approximately  new customers in sales of energy and revenue increased in compared to for all customer classes except industrial 
increases in retail sales of million and wholesale sales of million were also driven by favorable weather during when compared to wholesale sales growth was partially offset by price declines in the wholesale market 
downturns in the economy during and continuing into impacted energy usage throughout most of the industrial customer class 
total industrial revenue declined during by million and during by million as the number of industrial customers decreased due to a slowdown in the textile industry  as well as a decrease in usage in the chemical industry 
compared to  residential and commercial revenues reflected continued growth in the number of customers served by cp l electric partially offset by milder weather in cp l electric added over  new customers in milder weather in accounted for a decrease in retail revenue of million for the year compared to total kwh sales to wholesale customers decreased in from primarily due to mild weather 
however  revenues from wholesale customers increased in over due to the establishment of new long term contracts and the receipt of a termination payment on a long term contract in december expenses cp l electric s fuel expense increased million in  when compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in generation with a higher percentage of generation being produced by combustion turbines  which have higher fuel costs 
cp l electric s fuel expense increased million in compared to million in primarily due to increases in the price of coal  partially offset by decreases in generation 
for  purchased power decreased million  when compared to million in  mainly due to decreases in price and volume purchased 
for  purchased power increased million when compared to million in mainly due to favorable market conditions in the first quarter of fuel expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses and  as such  have no material impact on operating results 
cp l electric s total operations and maintenance expenses increased million in when compared to million in primarily due to storm costs of million see below  a lower pension credit of million  the establishment of an inventory reserve of million for materials that have no future benefit  increased salaries and benefits and other increases in maintenance and outage support 
cp l electric s operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in when compared to million in  primarily due to the absence of restoration costs associated with the severe winter storm and record breaking snowfall in january  as well as cost control efforts 
these amounts were partially offset by increases in planned nuclear outage costs and transmission expenses in a major ice storm struck central north carolina on december  as a result of the storm  up to  customers in cp l electric s service area were without power 
restoration included more than  line  service and tree personnel from states 
the outages resulted in million of increased operations and maintenance costs and million of increased capital costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in when compared to million in and decreased million in when compared to million in cp l electric s accelerated cost recovery program for nuclear generating assets allows flexibility in recording accelerated depreciation expense 
cp l electric recorded million of accelerated depreciation expense in and million in the year over year favorability was offset by additional depreciation recognized in  as compared to  on new assets that were placed in service during in  as approved by regulators  cp l electric recorded million of depreciation expense under the accelerated cost recovery program 
see note g to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for additional information about this program 
net interest expense decreased million in  when compared to million in  due primarily to reduced debt and lower interest rates 
net interest expense increased million in  when compared to million in  primarily due to higher debt balances used to fund construction programs 
in accordance with an sec order under puhca  effective in  tax benefits not related to acquisition interest expense that were previously held unallocated at the holding company must be allocated to the profitable subsidiaries 
as a result  million of the tax benefit that was previously held at the holding company  included in the other segment  was allocated to cp l electric in the allocation has no impact on the company s consolidated tax expense or net income 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pre tax income 
florida power electric the results shown in the progress energy consolidated financial statements for the florida power electric segment include operating results since the date of acquisition  november  therefore  and include full years of operations  while includes only one month 
as a result  the results of operations are not comparable to florida power electric contributed income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million for the month of december included in these amounts are wholesale energy marketing activities and immaterial trading activities  which are managed by progress ventures on behalf of florida power electric  that contributed net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million for the month of december florida power electric s earnings in were affected by the outcome of the florida power rate case settlement  which included a one time retroactive revenue refund of million million after tax  a decrease in retail rates of effective may   which resulted in an additional million decline in revenues  and an estimated revenue sharing refund of million 
these revenue declines were partially offset by million of lower depreciation and amortization pursuant to the rate case and increased service revenue rates 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement 
a comparison of the results of operations of florida power electric for the past three years follows 
revenues florida power s electric revenues for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class  as well as the impact of the rate case settlement on revenue  are as follows in millions customer class change change a residential    commercial industrial governmental revenue sharing refund retroactive retail rate refund total retail revenues    wholesale unbilled miscellaneous total electric revenues    a florida power electric revenues are included in the company s results of operations since november   the date of acquisition 
florida power electric s full year of revenue is included for comparative purposes only 
florida power s electric energy sales for the years ended december   and and the percentage change by year and by customer class are as follows in thousands of mwh customer class change change b residential    commercial    industrial    governmental    total retail energy sales    wholesale    unbilled total mwh sales    b florida power electric energy sales are included in the company s results of operations since november   the date of acquisition 
florida power electric s full year of sales is included for comparative purposes only 
florida power electric revenues decreased million from to the revenue declines were driven by the million impact of the rate case  mentioned previously 
additionally  wholesale revenues declined million  driven primarily by a contract that was not renewed 
year over year comparisons were also unfavorably impacted by the recognition of million of revenue deferred from to partially offsetting the unfavorable revenue impacts was growth in the residential approximately  additional customers and commercial approximately  additional customers customer classes 
additional offsets included weather conditions  primarily a warmer than normal summer in  and an increase in other service revenue  resulting primarily from increased rates allowed under the rate case settlement  along with higher transmission wheeling revenues 
residential and commercial sales increased in and reflect continued growth in the number of customers served by florida power electric  partially offset by milder weather and a downturn in the economy 
florida power electric added over  new customers in industrial sales declined in due to weakness in the manufacturing sector and phosphate industry  which were affected by the economic downturn 
sales to wholesale customers decreased for  primarily due to the mild weather 
expenses fuel used in generation and purchased power was billion for the year ended december   a decrease of million from the decrease is primarily due to a lower recovery of fuel expense that resulted from a mid course correction of florida power electric s fuel cost recovery clause  as part of the rate settlement  and lower purchased power costs  partially offset by an increase in coal prices and volume from high system requirements 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses and  as such  have no material impact on operating results 
fuel used in generation and purchased power was billion for the year ended december  and million for the one month of operations and maintenance expense increased million in when compared to million in  due primarily to a reduced pension credit of million  increased costs related to the commitment to excellence program of million  and an increase in other salary and benefit costs of million related partially to increased medical costs 
the commitment to excellence program was initiated in to improve service and reliability 
operations and maintenance expense was million for the one month of and included merger related charges 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in when compared to million in in addition to the depreciation and amortization reduction of approximately million related to the rate case  depreciation declined an additional million related to accelerated amortization on the tiger bay regulatory asset  which was created as a result of the early termination of certain long term cogeneration contracts 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further detail on the rate case 
florida power electric amortizes the regulatory asset according to a plan approved by the florida public service commission in and plans to fully amortize the asset by the end of in  million of accelerated amortization was recorded on the tiger bay regulatory asset  of which million was associated with deferred revenue from and had no impact on earnings 
depreciation and amortization expense was million for the one month of in  million of the tax benefit that was previously held at the company s holding company see earlier discussion in the cp l electric segment  was allocated to florida power electric 
other fluctuations in income taxes are primarily due to changes in pretax income 
diversified businesses the company s diversified businesses consist primarily of the progress ventures segment  the rail services segment  and progress telecom  caronet  srs and holding company operations  which are in the other segment and are explained in more detail below 
progress ventures progress ventures contributed segment income of million and million for and  respectively 
these amounts included wholesale energy marketing and immaterial trading net income of million and million in and  respectively  that progress ventures managed on behalf of the utilities 
due to the creation of progress ventures in and the acquisition of progress fuels subsidiaries through the fpc acquisition  the results of operations for the progress ventures segment are not comparable between and the progress ventures segment operations include nonregulated generation operations  natural gas exploration and production  coal fuel extraction  manufacturing and delivery  and energy marketing and limited trading activities on behalf of the utility operating companies as well as for its nonregulated plants 
progress ventures results for were impacted unfavorably by the weak energy market and lower synthetic fuel sales  offset partially by additional earnings from placing in service additional nonregulated generation plants and the purchase of westchester gas company 
progress ventures nonregulated generation operations generated net income of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the operations included one merchant plant with a megawatt capacity 
in  a plant was transferred from the cp l electric regulated segment to progress ventures  one operational plant was purchased from lg e energy corporation lg e 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements  and one additional plant was placed into service upon completion of construction 
at the end of  plants with  megawatts of capacity were operational 
this increase in capacity drove the increase in net income 
the earnings potential of the increased capacity was partially offset by the general softness in the energy market in the company has contracts representing   and of planned production capacity for through  respectively 
the decline results from the expiration of four contracts 
the company is actively pursuing opportunities with the current customers and other potential customers 
progress ventures subsidiary  mpc generating  llc  had two tolling agreements for output on one of its units with dynegy  inc through june the contracts with dynegy were terminated in december the company expects to recognize a gain in connection with the termination in the first quarter of if certain related contingencies are resolved  but does not currently have a customer for the output of the megawatt unit 
in  progress ventures natural gas exploration and production operations included the operations of mesa hydrocarbons  inc mesa  which owns natural gas reserves and operates wells in colorado and sells natural gas 
in  it also included similar operations of westchester gas company 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for discussion of the westchester gas company acquisition 
these gas operations generated net income of million and million in and  respectively 
westchester gas company produced million cubic feet of gas in  which represented of the combined production for the year 
this increased production drove the earnings increase from to progress ventures coal fuel extraction  manufacturing and delivery operations generated net income of million and million in and  respectively 
the progress ventures coal group produced and sold million and million tons of synthetic fuel in and the production and sale of the synthetic fuel from these facilities generate operating losses  but qualify for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code  which more than offset the effects of such losses 
see synthetic fuels under other matters below for additional discussion of these tax credits 
the sales resulted in tax credits of million and million being recognized in and  respectively 
the company is pursuing selling a portion of the synthetic fuel operations 
progress ventures energy marketing and trading operations generated net income of million and million in and  respectively 
this group focuses on marketing and selling wholesale power and limited financial trading 
wholesale marketing generated million and million of the group s earnings in and  respectively 
the earnings reductions from to are mainly attributable to reduced margins for wholesale electric sales 
this group also manages financial trades of power 
financial trades generated net losses of million and million in and  respectively  including associated overhead costs 
the primary driver of the increased loss in was the higher overhead associated with the plan to grow the marketing and trading activities  however  the company recently announced plans to reduce the scope of its trading activities 
rail services rail services operations represent the activities of progress rail services corporation progress rail and include railcar and locomotive repair  trackwork  rail parts reconditioning and sales  scrap metal recycling  railcar leasing and other rail related services 
rail services results for the year ended december   included rail services cumulative revenues and net loss from the date of acquisition  november   because rail services had been held for sale from the date of acquisition through the second quarter of rail services contributed net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss in includes a million after tax estimated impairment on assets held for sale related to railcar ltd  a leasing subsidiary of progress rail 
the company intends to sell the assets of railcar ltd 
in and has reported these assets as assets held for sale 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for discussion of this planned divestiture 
rail services results for both years were affected by a downturn in the overall economy  decreases in rail service procurement by major railroads and a downturn in the domestic scrap market 
rail services results were favorably impacted by aggressive cost cutting  new business opportunities and restructuring initiatives 
an sec order approving the merger of fpc requires the company to divest of rail services by november  the company is actively pursuing alternatives  but does not expect to find the right divestiture opportunity by that date 
therefore  the company plans to seek an extension from the sec 
other progress energy s other segment primarily includes the operations of srs  progress telecom and caronet 
the results of ncng have been excluded from the other segment because of its classification as a discontinued operation 
this segment also includes other nonregulated operations of cp l and fpc  as well as holding company results and consolidation and elimination adjustments 
the other segment had a net loss from continuing operations of million and million in and  respectively  and net income from continuing operations of million in the increase in the net loss in was primarily related to impairments and other charges in the telecommunications group and the reallocation of favorable income tax benefits to other segments 
these charges are partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization of million and the favorable impact of the contingent value obligations  which are discussed below 
the decrease in earnings for when compared to is primarily due to after tax charges of million from the assessment of the recoverability of the interpath investment and certain assets in the srs subsidiary  increases in after tax interest expense for holding company debt of million and goodwill amortization of million resulting from the acquisition of fpc 
in addition  the other segment net income in includes a million after tax gain on sale of assets  as described more fully below 
srs was engaged in software sales and energy services to help industrial  commercial and institutional customers manage energy costs 
in  srs refocused the business on energy services in the southeastern united states and consolidated remaining operations with other retail activities 
srs net losses  excluding after tax impairments and other charges discussed below  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the earnings decline from to resulted from a million loss on the sale of the assets of several divisions and from increased legal fees 
due to the historical losses at srs and the decline of the market value for technology companies  a valuation study was obtained to help assess the recoverability of srs s long lived assets in based on this assessment  an after tax asset impairment and other charges primarily legal expenses totaling million were recorded in see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on this impairment and other charges 
in addition  the company recorded after tax investment impairments of million for other than temporary declines in certain investments of srs in progress telecom and caronet had combined net losses of million and million for and  respectively 
in  caronet combined with one month of progress telecom contributed net income of million 
progress telecom and caronet provide broadband capacity services  dark fiber and wireless services in florida and the eastern united states 
due to the decline of the telecommunications industry and continued operating losses  the company obtained a valuation study in to assess the recoverability of progress telecom s and caronet s long lived assets 
based on these valuation studies  the company recorded an after tax impairment of million and other related after tax charges  primarily inventory adjustments  of million 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on this impairment and other charges 
effective june   caronet contributed the net assets used in its application service provider business to a newly formed company named interpath communications  inc interpath 
in may  interpath merged with a third party  diluting caronet s ownership interest from to and reduced the voting interest from to 
the company obtained valuation studies in and again in  after the merger of interpath 
as a result of these valuation studies  the company recorded impairments for other than temporary declines in the fair value of its investment in interpath of million and million in and  respectively 
see note b to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on this impairment 
in  caronet sold its limited partnership interest in bellsouth carolinas pcs  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
see note d to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further details on the sale 
excluding the impairments  other charges and the gain on the sale of the limited partnership interest discussed above  progress telecom and caronet had combined remaining losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
lower depreciation resulting from the write down of impaired assets contributed to the decrease in the remaining loss from to the reduction in the remaining loss in  when compared to  results from the removal of the interpath operations 
the other segment also includes progress energy s holding company results 
as part of the acquisition of fpc  goodwill of approximately billion was recorded  and amortization of million in and million in was included in the other segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
at december   the company had approximately billion of unamortized goodwill 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for more details on goodwill 
net pre tax interest charges in the other segment were million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
the increase in  when compared to  was primarily related to increased debt associated with the purchase of generating plants 
this was partially offset by lower interest rates and million of interest capitalization in related to the building of the nonregulated generating plants 
the increase in interest from to was primarily related to the debt used to finance the acquisition of fpc 
according to an sec order under puhca  progress energy s tax benefit not related to acquisition interest expense is to be allocated to profitable subsidiaries 
therefore  the tax benefit that was previously held in the holding company  included in the other segment  was allocated to the profitable subsidiaries effective with the allocation has no impact on consolidated tax expense or earnings 
however  in  the allocation increased the other segment s tax expense million with offsetting decreases in other segments primarily cp l electric and florida power electric 
progress energy issued million contingent value obligations cvos in connection with the fpc acquisition 
each cvo represents the right to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuel facilities owned by progress energy 
the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
at december   and  the cvos had a fair market value of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
progress energy recorded an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december   an unrealized loss of million for the year ended december  and an unrealized gain of million for the month ended december   to record the changes in fair value of cvos  which had average unit prices of  and at december   and  respectively 
discontinued operations in  the company approved the sale of ncng to piedmont natural gas company  inc as a result of this action  the operating results of ncng were reclassified to discontinued operations for all reportable periods 
progress energy expects to sell ncng for net proceeds of approximately million  which results in an estimated after tax loss on the sale of the assets of million  including the impact of interest expense allocated to ncng  as discussed in note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in doing so  certain estimates were made that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant estimates that may have a material impact on the financial results of the company and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
utility regulation the company s regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates the company is permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine the company is permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the changing regulatory framework in each state in which the company operates  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
the company continually reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements provides additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on the company 
asset impairments the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators exist 
examples of these indicators include current period losses combined with a history of losses  or a projection of continuing losses  or a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset group 
if an indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations and various factors are considered  including projected revenues and costs and market conditions 
during  the company recorded pre tax long lived asset impairments of million related to its telecommunications business 
see note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on this impairment and other charges 
the fair value of these assets was determined using an external valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
however  if the telecommunications market continues to deteriorate  the company s telecommunications related assets may be further adversely affected 
the company also continually reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
during and  the company recorded pre tax impairments to the cost method investment in interpath of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of this investment was determined using an external valuation study heavily weighted on a discounted cash flow methodology and using market approaches as supporting information 
these cash flows include numerous assumptions including the pace at which the telecommunications market will rebound 
in the fourth quarter of  the company sold its remaining interest in interpath for a nominal amount 
goodwill effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further detail on goodwill 
accounting standards require a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  used to measure the amount of the impairment loss if step one indicates a potential impairment  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test  which indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired as of january  in addition  the company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for cp l electric and florida power electric during  which indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired 
in connection with the pending sale of ncng  the company reviewed the carrying value of ncng  including goodwill  as discussed in note a to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
during  the company completed the acquisition of two electric generating projects  walton county power  llc and washington county power  llc 
the acquisitions resulted in goodwill of million 
the company has completed the purchase price allocation and will perform the annual goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of during  the company also acquired westchester gas company 
the purchase price has been preliminarily allocated to fixed assets including oil and gas properties  based on the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired 
the purchase price allocation for this acquisition will be finalized in the second quarter of  and if any of the purchase price is ultimately allocated to goodwill  an annual goodwill impairment test will be performed at that time 
synthetic fuels tax credits progress energy  through the progress ventures business unit  produces synthetic fuel from coal fines 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuel qualifies for tax credits under section of the internal revenue code section if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the feedstock used to produce such synthetic fuel 
any synthetic fuel tax credit amounts not utilized are carried forward indefinitely and are included in deferred taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further information on the synthetic fuel tax credits 
all of progress energy s synthetic fuel facilities have received private letter rulings from the internal revenue service irs with respect to their operations 
these tax credits are subject to review by the irs  and if progress energy fails to prevail through the administrative or legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section credits  with a significant impact on earnings and cash flows 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company s reported costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits described in note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements  primarily health benefits  are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  and key actuarial assumptions such as rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs and  for other postretirement benefits  medical trend rates 
due to a decline in market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate  the company lowered the discount rate to at december   which will increase the benefit costs recognized 
in addition  the continuing declines in the equity markets have adversely affected the fair value of plan assets  which will also increase the benefit costs recognized in evaluations of the effects of these factors has not been completed  but the company estimates that total cost for pension and other postretirement benefits will increase by approximately million over the amount recorded in  due in large part to these factors 
the majority of that increase has been anticipated and reflected in the company s budgeting forecasting process 
recoveries in the level of interest rates and equity markets would  correspondingly  have positive effects on future years benefit cost recognition 
the company has substantial pension plan assets  with a fair value of approximately billion at december  the company s expected rate of return on pension plan assets has been  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  
under the accounting standard for pension accounting  the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  the company would only adjust that return if its fundamental assessment of the debt and equity markets changes or its investment policy changes significantly 
the company continues to believe that its pension plan s investment mix supports the long term rate of being used 
the company did not increase the expected long term rate of return in response to the abnormally high market return levels of the latter s and does not believe it is appropriate to adjust the rate downward because of recent market declines 
a change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension cost by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview progress energy is a registered holding company and  as such  has no operations of its own 
the ability to meet its obligations is primarily dependent on the earnings and cash flows of its two electric utilities and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds to progress energy 
the cash requirements of progress energy arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of its electric utility operations as well as the expansion of its diversified businesses  primarily those of the progress ventures segment 
progress energy relies upon its operating cash flow  generated primarily by its two regulated electric utility subsidiaries  commercial paper facilities and its ability to access long term capital markets for its liquidity needs 
since a substantial majority of progress energy s operating costs are related to its two regulated electric utilities  a significant portion of these costs are recovered from customers through fuel and energy cost recovery clauses 
during  the company expects to realize approximately million of net cash proceeds from the sale of ncng 
the company also expects to receive between million and million of proceeds through the sale of common stock issued through the progress energy direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan  and its k savings and stock ownership plan 
progress energy s cash from operations and common stock issuance proceeds in are expected to fund its capital expenditures 
progress energy expects to use the proceeds from the sale of ncng to reduce indebtedness then outstanding 
to the extent necessary  incremental borrowings or commercial paper issuances may also be used as a source of liquidity 
progress energy forecasts its liquidity resources to be sufficient to fund its current business plans 
risk factors associated with commercial paper backup credit facilities and credit ratings are discussed below as well as in the company s sec filings 
the following discussion of progress energy s liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
cash flows from operations cash from operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and capital expenditures 
total cash from operations for was billion  up million from the increase in cash from operating activities for when compared with is largely the result of the november   acquisition of fpc 
the results reflected one month s cash from operations of fpc 
progress energy s two electric utilities produced approximately of consolidated cash from operations in it is expected that the two electric utilities will continue to produce a majority of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years as its nonregulated investments  primarily generation assets  are placed into service and begin generating operating cash flows 
in addition  progress ventures synthetic fuel operations do not currently produce positive operating cash flow primarily due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and when tax credits are realized for tax purposes 
total cash from operations provided the funding for approximately of the company s property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and diversified business property additions during the remaining funds were obtained through debt and equity issuances by progress energy as discussed below 
progress energy expects its operating cash flow to exceed its projected capital expenditures beginning in investing activities cash used in investing activities was billion in  up approximately million when compared with the increase is due primarily to the expansion of pvi s generation portfolio 
in february  pvi purchased two generating projects from lg e energy corp 
for approximately million 
cash used in investing was billion in  up million when compared with after adjusting for the acquisition of florida progress 
the increase is due primarily to the expansion of pvi s generation portfolio and the absence of proceeds from the sale in of the bellsouth carolinas pcs limited partnership interest 
capital expenditures for progress energy s regulated electric operations were billion or approximately of consolidated capital expenditures in as shown in the table below  the company anticipates that the proportion of nonregulated capital spending to total capital expenditures will decrease substantially in when compared with the decrease reflects the expected completion of pvi s nonregulated generation portfolio by the summer of progress energy expects the majority of its capital expenditures to be incurred at its regulated operations

see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements and current regulatory environment under other matters below for more information on this legislation 
cp l has determined that its external funding levels do not fully meet the nuclear decommissioning financial assurance levels required by the us nuclear regulatory commission 
the funding levels have been adversely affected by the recent declines in the equity markets 
the total shortfall is approximately million dollars for robinson unit no 
 million dollars for brunswick unit no 
and million dollars for brunswick unit no 
cp l is currently evaluating the alternatives for meeting the financial assurance requirements  which primarily include increasing annual deposits to the external trust by an estimated million annually or obtaining a parent company guarantee 
the funding status for these facilities would be positively affected by a recovery in the equity markets and by the approval of license extension applications 
see note h to the progress energy consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased approximately million over  primarily due to issuances of long term debt and common stock equity by progress energy 
cash provided by financing activities decreased by billion when comparing to this decrease was due to the november   acquisition of fpc  which was funded from the sale of short term commercial paper

regional transmission organizations and standard market design florida power in early  ferc issued order regarding regional transmission organizations rtos 
this order set minimum characteristics and functions that rtos must meet  including independent transmission service 
as a result of order  florida power  along with florida power light company and tampa electric company  filed with ferc  in october  an application for approval of a grid florida rto 
on march   ferc issued an order provisionally approving gridflorida 
however  in july  ferc issued orders recommending that companies in the southeast engage in a mediation to develop a plan for a single rto for the southeast 
florida power participated in the mediation 
ferc has not issued an order specifically on this mediation 
ferc held a discussion on the mediation report on november  in january  ferc stated that it would issue orders on the rto formations for the southeast during the first half of after the development of a standardized market design for the wholesale electricity market 
on july   ferc issued its notice of proposed rulemaking in docket no 
rm  remedying undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design smd nopr 
the proposed rules set forth in the smd nopr would require  among other things  that all transmission owning utilities transfer control of their transmission facilities to an independent third party  transmission service to bundled retail customers be provided under the ferc regulated transmission tariff  rather than state mandated terms and conditions  new terms and conditions for transmission service be adopted nationwide  including new provisions for pricing transmission in the event of transmission congestion  new energy markets be established for the buying and selling of electric energy  and load serving entities be required to meet minimum criteria for generating reserves 
if adopted as proposed  the rules set forth in the smd nopr would materially alter the manner in which transmission and generation services are provided and paid for 
florida power  as a subsidiary of progress energy  filed comments on november  and supplement comments on january  on january   ferc announced the issuance of a white paper on smd nopr to be released in april florida power  as a subsidiary of progress energy  plans to file comments on the white paper 
ferc has also indicated that it expects to issue final rules during the summer the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters or the effect that they may have on the gridflorida proceedings currently ongoing before the ferc 
on may   the fpsc initiated dockets to review the prudence of the gridflorida applicants decision to form and participate in the gridflorida rto 
on october  the fpsc abated its proceedings regarding its review of the proposed gridflorida rto 
the gridflorida rto proposal includes the formation of a not for profit independent system operator iso by the joint applicants florida power corporation  florida power light company and tampa electric company 
participation is expected from many of the other transmission owners in the state of florida 
the fpsc previously found the applicants were prudent in proactively forming gridflorida but ordered the applicants to modify their proposal 
the modifications include but are not limited to addressing pricing structure that recognizes the fpsc s jurisdiction over retail transmission rates  pricing rate structure of long term transmission contracts  elimination of pancaking of short term transmission revenues  cost recovery of incremental costs imposed on the applicants  demarcation dates for new facilities and long term transmission contracts  and market design 
the fpsc action to abate the proceedings came in response to the florida office of public counsel s appeal before the state supreme court requesting review of the fpsc s order approving the transfer of operational control of electric transmission assets to an rto under the jurisdiction of the ferc 
it is unknown what the outcome of this appeal will be at this time

the proposed rules set forth in the smd nopr would require  among other things  that all transmission owning utilities transfer control of their transmission facilities to an independent third party  transmission service to bundled retail customers be provided under the ferc regulated transmission tariff  rather than state mandated terms and conditions  new terms and conditions for transmission service be adopted nationwide  including new provisions for pricing transmission in the event of transmission congestion  new energy markets be established for the buying and selling of electric energy  and load serving entities be required to meet minimum criteria for generating reserves 
if adopted as proposed  the rules set forth in the smd nopr would materially alter the manner in which transmission and generation services are provided and paid for 
cp l  as a subsidiary of progress energy  filed comments on november  and supplement comments on january  on january   ferc announced the issuance of a white paper on smd nopr to be released in april cp l  as a subsidiary of progress energy  plans to file comments on the white paper

the appeal of order no 
was heard by the court on october   and its decision affirmed ferc s order 
the ncuc issued an order holding that cp l s and duke energy corporation s petition to transfer operational control of their transmission assets to gridsouth shall be held in abeyance pending further order

franchise litigation six cities  with a total of approximately  customers  have sued florida power in various circuit courts in florida 
the lawsuits principally seek a declaratory judgment that the cities have the right to purchase florida power s electric distribution system located within the municipal boundaries of the cities  a declaratory judgment that the value of the distribution system must be determined through arbitration  and injunctive relief requiring florida power to continue to collect from florida power s customers and remit to the cities  franchise fees during the pending litigation  and as long as florida power continues to occupy the cities rights of way to provide electric service  notwithstanding the expiration of the franchise ordinances under which florida power had agreed to collect such fees 
five circuit courts have entered orders requiring arbitration to establish the purchase price of florida power s electric distribution system within five cities 
two appellate courts have upheld those circuit court decisions and authorized cities to determine the value of florida power s electric distribution system within the cities through arbitration 
to date  no city has attempted to actually exercise the right to purchase any portion of florida power s electric distribution system 
arbitration in one of the cases was held in august and an award was issued in october setting the value of florida power s distribution system within one city at approximately million 
at this time  whether and when there will be further proceedings following this award cannot be determined 
additional arbitrations have been scheduled to occur in the first and second quarters of as part of the above litigation  two appellate courts have also reached opposite conclusions regarding whether florida power must continue to collect from its customers and remit to the cities franchise fees under the expired franchise ordinances 
florida power has filed an appeal with the florida supreme court to resolve the conflict between the two appellate courts 
the florida supreme court has issued an order setting a briefing schedule and reserving ruling on accepting jurisdiction 
on january   florida power served its initial brief in the supreme court and its request for oral argument 
three amicus curiae also filed motions seeking leave to participate in support of florida power s position and filed amicus briefs 
no oral argument has yet been set 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these matters at this time

spent fuel storage on december   cp l received permission from the nrc to increase its storage capacity for spent fuel rods in wake county  north carolina 
the nrc s decision came two years after cp l asked for permission to open two unused storage pools at the shearon harris nuclear plant harris plant 
the approval meant that cp l was able to complete cooling systems and to begin installing storage racks in its third and fourth storage pools at the harris plant 
pressurized water reactors on march   the nrc sent a bulletin to companies that hold licenses for pressurized water reactors pwrs requiring information on the structural integrity of the reactor vessel head and a basis for concluding that the vessel head will continue to perform its function as a coolant pressure boundary 
the company filed responses as required 
inspections of the vessel heads at the company s pwr plants have been performed during previous outages 
in october  at the crystal river plant cr  one nozzle was found to have a crack and was repaired  however  no degradation of the reactor vessel head was identified 
current plans are to replace the vessel head at cr during its next regularly scheduled refueling outage in at the robinson plant  an inspection was completed in april and no penetration nozzle cracking was identified and there was no degradation of the reactor vessel head 
at the harris plant  sufficient inspections were completed during the last refueling outage in the fourth quarter of to conclude there is no degradation of the reactor vessel head 
the company s brunswick plant has a different design and is not affected by the issue 
on august   the nrc issued an additional bulletin dealing with head leakage due to cracks near the control rod nozzles 
the nrc has asked licensees to commit to high inspection standards to ensure the more susceptible plants have no cracks 
the robinson plant is in this category and had a refueling outage in october the company completed a series of examinations in october of the entire reactor pressure vessel head and found no indications of control rod drive mechanism cracking and no corrosion of the head itself 
during the outage  a boric acid leakage walkdown of the reactor coolant pressure boundary was also completed and no corrosion was found 
for cr  the company has responded to the nrc that previous inspections are sufficient until the reactor head is replaced in the fall of for the harris plant  the company does not plan further inspections until its next regularly scheduled outage in spring of in february  the nrc issued order ea  requiring specific inspections of the reactor pressure vessel head and associated penetration nozzles at pwrs 
the company has responded to the order  stating that the company intends to comply with the previsions of the order 
no adverse impact is anticipated 
security on february   the nrc issued an interim compensatory measure with regard to security at nuclear plants 
this order formalized many of the security enhancements made at the company s nuclear plants since september this order includes additional restrictions on access  increased security presence and closer coordination with the company s partners in intelligence  military  law enforcement and emergency response at the federal  state and local levels 
the company completed the requirements by the established deadlines and expects the nrc to perform an inspection for compliance in the near future 
in addition  in january the nrc issued a final order with regards to access control 
this order requires the company to enhance its current access control program by january  the company expects that it will be in full compliance with the order by the established deadline 
as the nrc  other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues  it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required 
synthetic fuels tax credits progress energy  through the progress ventures business segment  produces synthetic fuel from coal fines 
the production and sale of the synthetic fuel qualifies for tax credits under section if certain requirements are satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the feedstock used to produce such synthetic fuel 
any synthetic fuel tax credit amounts not utilized are carried forward indefinitely and are included in deferred taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the progress energy consolidated financial statements 
all of progress energy s synthetic fuel facilities have received private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations 
these tax credits are subject to review by the irs  and if progress energy fails to prevail through the administrative or legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section credits  with a significant impact on earnings and cash flows 
tax credits for the months ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
total section credits generated to date including fpc prior to its acquisition by the company are approximately million 
one synthetic fuel entity  colona synfuel limited partnership  lllp colona  from which the company and fpc prior to its acquisition by the company has been allocated approximately million in tax credits to date  is being audited by the irs 
the audit of colona was expected 
the company is audited regularly in the normal course of business  as are most similarly situated companies 
in september  all of progress energy s majority owned synthetic fuel entities  including colona  were accepted into the irs pre filing agreement pfa program 
the pfa program allows taxpayers to voluntarily accelerate the irs exam process in order to seek resolution of specific issues 
either the company or the irs can withdraw from the program at any time  and issues not resolved through the program may proceed to the next level of the irs exam process 
while the ultimate outcome is uncertain  the company believes that participation in the pfa program will likely shorten the tax exam process 
in management s opinion  progress energy is complying with the private letter rulings and all the necessary requirements to be allowed such credits under section and believes it is likely  although it cannot provide certainty  that it will prevail if challenged by the irs on any credits taken 
the current section tax credit program expires in the company has retained an advisor to assist in selling an interest in one or more synthetic fuel entities 
the company is pursuing the sale of a portion of its synthetic fuel production capacity that is underutilized due to limits on the amount of credits that can be generated and utilized by the company 
the company would expect to retain an ownership interest and to operate any sold facility for a management fee 
the final outcome and timing of these discussions is uncertain and the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk progress energy  inc 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
certain market risks are inherent in the company s financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the company s primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to its long term debt and commercial paper  and fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to its nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
the company manages its market risk in accordance with its established risk management policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of the company s open trading positions was less than a million liability position at december  the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions or positions associated with the company s operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
interest rate risk the company manages its interest rate risks through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
variable rate debt has rates that adjust in periods ranging from daily to monthly 
interest rate derivative instruments may be used to adjust interest rate exposures and to protect against adverse movements in rates 
the following tables provide information as of december  and  about the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and fpc obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate swaps and interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates

marketable securities price risk the company s electric utility subsidiaries maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of these funds was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company actively monitors its portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the company s regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect the earnings of the company 
contingent value obligations market value risk in connection with the acquisition of fpc  the company issued million contingent value obligations cvos 
each cvo represents the right to receive contingent payments based on the performance of four synthetic fuel facilities purchased by subsidiaries of fpc in october the payments  if any  are based on the net after tax cash flows the facilities generate 
these cvos are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december  and  the fair value of these cvos was million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in the december  market price would result in a million decrease in the fair value of the cvos
