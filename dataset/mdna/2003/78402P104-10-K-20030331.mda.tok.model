overview the company conducts its insurance business in two business segments direct healthcare liability insurance and assumed reinsurance operations 
direct healthcare liability insurance represents professional liability insurance for physicians  oral and maxillofacial surgeons and dentists  healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers 
the direct healthcare liability includes premiums assumed under fronting arrangements related to the brown brown dental program 
assumed reinsurance represents the book of assumed worldwide reinsurance of professional  commercial and personal liability coverages  commercial and residential property risks  accident and health and workers compensation coverages and marine coverages

in  the company began expansion into other professional liability products and into other geographical markets 
the principal product expansion was into professional liability insurance for hospitals 
from through  the company added more than hospitals to its program 
these policies were written through national and regional brokers and covered facilities in four states outside california 
at approximately the same time  the company undertook a major geographic expansion in the physician and small medical group market through an arrangement with brown brown  a leading publicly held insurance broker 
this arrangement commenced in  eventually encompassed nine states and in was expanded to include dentists in two states 
during the same period  the company also expanded into underwriting greater risk nonstandard physicians in a number of states outside california 
the company encountered intense price competition in its hospital expansion efforts 
during  the company incurred unacceptable losses under its hospital policies 
the company experienced adverse loss development in its prior years loss reserves for hospitals and significant ongoing losses in this program  which is reflected in the results for the year ended december  the company substantially reduced its hospital exposures during through policy nonrenewals and rate increases 
at the beginning of  it insured only hospitals  and this was reduced to hospitals at december   and the last hospital policy expired in december in  and  the company derived approximately  and of its healthcare liability earned premium volume  respectively  from policies issued outside the state of california  principally under the brown brown and nonstandard physician programs 
in  the company recognized that these programs were seriously underpriced and implemented significant premium increases  averaging approximately and in and  respectively  in its principal non california markets  and immediately instituted more stringent underwriting and pricing guidelines in these states 
despite the significant price increases and more stringent underwriting guidelines  the non california programs produced significant underwriting losses in  and the company and brown brown agreed to terminate both the physician and dental programs no later than march  during  the company continued to issue and renew those policies under the brown brown programs that satisfy the stringent underwriting standards 
the company applied these same standards to the nonstandard physician policies renewed outside california 
as of december    policies were in force related to the brown brown program 
that number was reduced to policies as of december  the company issued no new nonstandard physician policies outside of california in during  the company will concentrate its efforts on maintaining its core physician and medical group business in california and delaware 
the company does not expect to initiate any significant new programs outside california during assumed reinsurance the company rapidly expanded its assumed reinsurance operations since it formed the division in late written premiums were  and million  respectively for  and earned premiums  which lag behind written premiums  were  and million  respectively for  and loss experience in this segment is based significantly on actuarial estimates  as actual losses are still in their early stages of development 
in  the unprecedented september   terrorist attack materially impacted the results in this segment 
the company identified losses of million  net of reinsurance benefit as of december   and a further million in losses has been recorded in in december  the company entered a quota share reinsurance agreement with goshawk that divested substantially all of the company s ongoing assumed reinsurance operations 
the cession under the goshawk reinsurance treaty impacted assumed reinsurance results negatively by million 
results of operations three year comparison direct healthcare liability insurance segment the company underwrites professional and related liability policy coverages for physicians including oral and maxilofacial surgeons  physician medical groups and clinics  hospitals  dentists  managed care organizations and other providers in the healthcare industry 
as a result of the company s withdrawal from certain segments of the healthcare industry  the premiums earned are split between core and non core premium 
core premium represents california and delaware business excluding the brown brown dental program and hospital business 
non core business represents other state business related to the brown brown and hospital programs including those in california 
the following table summarizes by core and non core business the underwriting results of the direct healthcare liability insurance segment for the periods indicated 
direct healthcare liability insurance segment underwriting results core non core total year ended december  premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss and lae ratio underwriting ratio combined ratio year ended december  premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting loss loss and lae ratio underwriting ratio combined ratio year ended december  premiums written premiums earned losses and lae incurred underwriting expenses underwriting gain loss loss and lae ratio underwriting ratio combined ratio core business premiums written for the core business increased and  in and  respectively  as average rate increases of and in and  respectively  were partially offset by a decline in the number of insureds 
premiums earned in the core direct healthcare liability insurance business increased and in and  respectively  primarily due to rate increases 
the loss ratio for was compared to a loss ratio of for the change in loss ratio reflected increases in average claim costs offset by a decline in the frequency of claims and the effect of the average rate increases on earned premiums 
losses and lae increased significantly in from primarily due to smaller favorable developments in on prior year reserves 
the expense ratio decreased from in to in the primary reason for the change was staff reductions implemented in april and november the underwriting expense ratio increased in primarily due to a larger proportion of the core business being written through general agencies  thus increasing commission expenses 
non core business premiums written decreased in to million from million in and million in this resulted from significant average rate increases of and in and  respectively  being offset by even more significant declines in the number of brown brown insureds in from  at december   to insureds at december  the increases in rates and the significant decline in insureds resulted from the company s remedial actions taken to mitigate the significant losses arising from this business 
after march   no new or renewal business will be written in the non core programs as the company exists these markets 
the decrease in written premium in was primarily the result of this decline in hospital writings 
premium earned in the non core direct healthcare liability insurance business decreased as the company began its withdrawal from states other than california and delaware and its hospital program wound down in and and written premium declined 
the lower loss ratio in of compared to in is the result of the significant rate increases being offset by additional upward development in loss reserves for prior years of million in despite the significant rate increases taken in  the loss ratio deteriorated significantly in from as adverse development of million in from prior years began to emerge 
this development related primarily to programs administered by the brown brown agency 
in addition  general increases in average claim costs continued to rise for the non core business 
the underwriting expense ratio increased in versus as the company expensed previously deferred acquisition costs in in light of the unprofitability of the non core business 
the underwriting expense ratio changed from in to in the primary reason for the change was the expense charge in of acquisition costs previously deferred and the impact of closing out of state offices 
assumed reinsurance segment the following table summarizes the underwriting results of the assumed reinsurance segment for the periods indicated 
assumed reinsurance segment underwriting results for the year ended december premiums written premiums earned underwriting expenses losses wtc losses underwriting and other operating expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the assumed reinsurance segment continued to expand in premiums written increased in as more and larger treaties were added to the portfolio 
the written premium for the assumed reinsurance segment was essentially unchanged from as premiums were ceded under the goshawk treaty in the fourth quarter premiums earned increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in earned premiums is primarily attributable to the increase in premiums written in and the beginning of the loss ratio declined in to from in the year and loss ratios were impacted by and percentage points  respectively  because of the world trade center terrorist attack 
the loss ratios without the effect of the world trade center terrorist attack were and for and respectively 
this increase represents changes in to the initial estimates of loss ratios for prior years as more information became available and was reported to the company 
the underwriting and other operating expense ratio was in and in and in the underwriting and other operating expense ratio increased in over as commission rates rose as proportionately more business was written from lloyd s syndicates which generally have higher expense ratios 
the underwriting and other operating expense ratio increased in  primarily because of the goshawk transaction expenses discussed below 
as a result of the insurance subsidiaries decline in statutory surplus in and the resulting impact on the capital adequacy ratios under the am best and naic capital adequacy models  the company attempted to raise additional capital in the first half of due to market conditions at that time  its capital raising efforts were unsuccessful 
in the latter half of  the company focused on attaining a reinsurance agreement to retrocede the future written and earned premium after june   related to its assumed reinsurance business 
this course of action culminated in the signing of a reinsurance agreement with a subsidiary of goshawk in december this treaty cedes effectively all of the unearned premium and future reported premium after june   for the assumed business written for underwriting years and by the company million in and approximately million to be written in future periods 
this treaty relieves the company of significant underwriting leverage in and and significantly improves the company s risk based capital adequacy ratios under both the am best and naic models 
the treaty has no limitations on loss recoveries and includes a profit sharing provision should the combined ratios calculated on the base premium ceded be below 
the treaty requires goshawk to reimburse the company for its acquisition and administrative expenses 
in addition  the company is required to pay goshawk additional premium in excess of the base premium ceded of or an estimated million 
the additional premium reduced earned premium by million and will reduce earned premium by an estimated million 
the goshawk reinsurance treaty has both prospective and retroactive elements as defined in financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
as such  any gains under the contract will be deferred and amortized to income based upon the expected recovery 
no gains are anticipated currently 
losses related to future earned premium ceded  as well as  as development on losses related to existing earned premium ceded after june   will ultimately determine whether a gain will be recorded under the contract 
the retroactive accounting treatment required under fasb requires that a charge to income be recorded to the extent premiums ceded under the contract are in excess of the estimated losses and expenses ceded under the contract 
the charge related to the cession of the unearned premium as of july   and ceded premium written in the third quarter is included in operating expenses in the assumed reinsurance segment 
the charge and placement fees amounted to million and was recorded in the fourth quarter the assumed reinsurance premiums written in the fourth quarter ceded to goshawk has reduced premiums written for the segment with a corresponding reduction in premiums earned and net incurred losses 
other operations net investment income decreased million or to million in from million in this decrease is primarily a result in the decline in average rate of return from in to in net investment income increased approximately million to million from million in this increase was a result of a increase in average invested assets and a shift in investment mix from tax exempt securities to higher yielding taxable bonds in the average rate of return on invested assets was and in and  respectively 
the company realized million in capital gains in versus million in this increased statutory capital for insurance regulatory purposes and improved the insurance subsidiaries risk based capital ratios 
during  the company realized million of investment gains as compared to million in realized investment losses in the company had an income tax benefit of million in compared to a benefit of million in and expense of million in liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
because of uncertainty related to the timing of the payment of claims  cash from operations for a property and casualty insurance company can vary substantially from period to period 
during  the company had negative cash flow from operations of million compared to positive cash flow of million in the negative cash flow in was principally attributable to decreased premium written and increased loss payments on the non core healthcare liability business and the goshawk reinsurance agreement 
the company invests its cash flow from operations in both fixed maturity securities and equity securities 
the company s current policy is to limit its investment in equity securities and its real estate to no more than of the total market value of its investments 
accordingly  the company s portfolio of unaffiliated equity securities had a fair value of million at december  the company plans to continue its focus on taxable fixed maturity securities for the indefinite future 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in high quality  short term securities to meet short term operating liquidity requirements  including the payment of losses and lae 
short term investments totaled million  or of invested assets  at december  the company believes that all of its short term and fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
scpie holdings is an insurance holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its insurance company subsidiaries 
its principal sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to earnings or surplus  without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the california department of insurance 
scpie holdings principal insurance company subsidiary may pay dividends to scpie holdings in any month period  without regulatory approval  to the extent such dividends do not exceed the greater of i of its statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year or ii its statutory net income for the preceding year 
applicable regulations further require that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  and permit the payment of dividends only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus unless the payment out of other funds receives regulatory approval 
the amount of dividends that the insurance company subsidiaries are able to pay to scpie holdings during without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
common stock dividends paid to stockholders were per share in these dividends were funded through dividends from the company s insurance subsidiaries received in prior years 
the company has declared a quarterly dividend of per share  payable on march  payment of future dividends is subject to board approval  earnings and the financial condition of the company 
as of december   scpie holdings held cash and short terms securities of million 
based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  the company believes that its sources of funds including dividends from the insurance subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet the liquidity needs of scpie holdings over the next months and beyond 
the company had borrowings of million outstanding at december   under a credit agreement with three bank lenders 
on february   the company fully repaid the outstanding balance  and the parties terminated the credit agreement 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
contractual commitments the company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally for providing letters of credit in connection with its assumed reinsurance segment and for leasing office space for its headquarters and other regional offices 
the table below presents the contractual payments due by period or expiration period for each obligation or commitment contractual commitments as of december   are as follows thereafter payments due by period in thousands operating leases in november  the company arranged a letter of credit facility in the amount of million with barclays bank plc 
letters of credit issued under the facility fulfill the requirements of lloyd s and guarantee loss reserves under reinsurance contracts 
as of december   letter of credit issuance under the facility was approximately million 
securities of million are pledged as collateral under the facility 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related notes 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
premium revenue recognition direct healthcare liability insurance premiums written are primarily earned on a daily pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
accordingly  unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired portion of the policies in force 
reinsurance premiums assumed are estimated based on information provided by ceding companies 
the information used in establishing these estimates is reviewed and subsequent adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
these premiums are earned over the terms of the related reinsurance contracts 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are comprised of case reserves for known claims  incurred but not reported reserves for unknown claims and any potential development for known claims  and reserves for the cost of administration and settlement of both known and unknown claims 
such liabilities are established based on known facts and interpretation of circumstances  including the company s experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments and pending levels of unpaid claims  as well as court decisions and economic conditions 
the effects of inflation are considered in the reserving process 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided 
any increase in the amount of reserves  including reserves for insured events of prior years  could have an adverse effect on the company s results for the period in which the adjustments are made 
the company utilizes both its internal actuarial staff and independent actuaries in establishing its reserves 
the company does not discount its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company had a growing volume of assumed reinsurance between and assumed reinsurance is a line of business with an inherent volatility 
also in the absence of a historical data base of our own experience due to the newness of the program  greater reliance is placed on underwriting and industry information to estimate the appropriate loss reserves 
the assumed reinsurance business has exposure to losses from the events of september  estimation of ultimate liabilities for this exposure is unusually difficult and thus subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income  including investment income 
if such costs are estimated to be unrecoverable  they are expensed 
recoverability is analyzed based on the company s assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  growth rate of the assets supporting the liabilities  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire lives 
deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement  such as medical malpractice claims 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s rate making process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the investment portfolio of the company is subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of fixed maturity investments 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to fixed maturities are limited due to the large number of such investments and their distributions across many different industries and geographics 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity securities  which at december   comprised of total investments at market value 
us government and tax exempt bonds represent of the market values of fixed maturity investments  with the remainder consisting almost entirely of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of common stocks  account for of total investments at market value 
the other investment  which is comprised of a mutual fund investment that contains derivative financial instruments  accounts for of total investments at market value 
of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term money market funds 
the remaining of investments consists of real estate leased to third parties 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the value of the common stock equity investments is dependent upon general conditions in the securities markets and the business and financial performance of the individual companies in the portfolio 
values are typically based on future economic prospects as perceived by investors in the equity markets 
the company also holds an investment in a limited partnership  which invests in a portfolio of offshore hedge funds 
the investment return depends on the performance of the portfolio  which includes both interest rate risk and credit risk 
this investment had a value of million at december  the company s invested assets are subject to interest rate risk 
the following table presents the effect on current estimated fair values of the fixed maturity securities available for sale and common stocks assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity prices 
the analysis excludes real estate and the other investment 
carrying value estimated fair value at current market rates prices estimated fair value at adjusted market rates prices as indicated below in thousands december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates adjusted equity prices assume a decline in market values for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
the estimated fair values at current market rates for financial instruments subject to interest rate risk in the table above are the same as those disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling where appropriate 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity eg  mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited as it does not consider any actions the company could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices
