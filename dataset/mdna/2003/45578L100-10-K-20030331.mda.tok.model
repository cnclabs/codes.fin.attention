in the md a and other sections that follow there will be references to the mod contract 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a major contract to provide the united kingdom ministry of defense mod with software  support and services 
this contract generated of revenue in in january  the mod announced it was suspending all work on the contract due to budgetary constraints 
as a result of this suspension  the company engaged in a significant restructuring effort in an attempt to right size its work force and facilities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  property and equipment  investments  accrued expenses  restructuring  debt covenants  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the policies below as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these policies and the disclosures below with the audit committee of the board of directors 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex and often subject to interpretation 
very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue are followed  however  certain judgments affect the application of the company s revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
revenue is generated through two sources a software license revenue and b support and service revenue 
software license revenue is generated from licensing the rights to use our products directly to end users and indirectly  to a lesser extent  through third party resellers 
support and service revenue is generated from sales of customer support services maintenance contracts  consulting services and training services performed for customers that license the company s products 
for license arrangements that do not require modification of the software  revenue is recognized in accordance with accounting standards for software companies  including statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  related interpretations  including technical practice aids  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
license revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement becomes effective as evidenced by a signed contract  product shipment  a fixed or determinable license fee  and assurance of collection 
if the license fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if a nonstandard acceptance period is provided  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance and the expiration of the acceptance period 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products and or services  the total arrangement fee is allocated among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to delivered elements 
elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software products  maintenance which includes customer support services and unspecified upgrades  and consulting services 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change once the element is sold separately 
revenue from the company s professional consulting and implementation services is generally time and material based and is recognized as the work is performed 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
some professional consulting services involve fixed price and or fixed time arrangements and are recognized using contract accounting  which requires the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method  with progress to completion measured by using labor cost inputs and with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins on these projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
revenue from maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support contract  typically one year 
revenue from web hosting also referred to as asp or application service provider services is recognized based upon contractually agreed upon rates per user or service  over a contractually defined time period 

table of contents accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts billed and unbilled accounts receivable comprise trade receivables that are credit based and do not require collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company records a provision for uncollectible accounts on sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical collection patterns 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future collections  revenue could be overstated 
on an ongoing basis  the company also evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
the company evaluates the collectibility of specific accounts using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balance s  evaluation of the account s financial condition and credit scores  recent payment history  and discussions with the company s account executive for the specific customer and with the customer directly 
based upon this evaluation of the collectibility of accounts receivable  any increase or decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company generates a significant portion of revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the utility industry 
as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable were attributable to software license fees and support and services sales to utility customers 
in determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts  we have considered the utility industry s financial condition  as well as the financial condition of individual utility customers 
recently there have been well publicized issues with certain utility companies as a result of activities in the unregulated wholesale sectors 
while our utility industry customers are generally in the regulated or retail sector  their unregulated affiliated activities might affect our ability to collect amounts due 
we monitor the credit status of our customers and  where deemed necessary  provide for potential uncollectibility 
the company generated million of its revenues from a single customer  magnox electric plc  located in the united kingdom 
as of december   approximately million of the company s accounts receivable were attributable to this customer 
the company does not anticipate accounts receivable collectibility issues related to this customer s account 
in the mod contract provided of revenues  with approximately million in accounts receivable at december  this amount was fully collected 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable through sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   approximately million of the company s gross billed accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currencies  of which approximately million were denominated in british pounds 
historically  the foreign currency gains and losses on these receivables have not been significant  and the company has determined that foreign currency derivative products are not required to hedge the company s exposure 
if there were a significant decline in the british pound exchange rate  the us dollar equivalents received from our customers could be significantly less than the reported amount 
a decline in the exchange rate of the british pound to the us dollar of from the rate as of december  would result in the company receiving  less if the pounds were converted to us dollars at that rate 
restructuring the company has accrued the cost of redundant leased office space in san francisco  ca  dallas  tx and pittsburgh  pa through restructuring charges in the years through the accrual is included in the consolidated financial statements in other accrued liabilities for amounts due within one year and obligations under capital leases and other liabilities for amounts due after one year 
the redundant office space was a result of the company s relocation of its headquarters and certain administrative functions from san francisco to atlanta  ga in and  and the suspension of the mod contract in additions to 
table of contents the accrual were made in due to the deterioration of the rental markets in all three locations  this deterioration has resulted in the company receiving less than anticipated amounts in sublease arrangements due to lower lease rates and longer times taken to sublease the office space 
the company reviews this accrual and evaluates its adequacy on an ongoing basis 
should rental conditions deteriorate to the point where the redundant office space is not ever leased  the company will incur additional charges totaling approximately million over the period from through should rental conditions improve  it is possible that higher than anticipated sublease income will be generated 
any required increase or decrease in this accrual will be reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a change is necessary
