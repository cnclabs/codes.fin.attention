critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates including but not limited to those related to o allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  o allowance for inventories  o sales allowances  o useful life or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  o deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  o licensing revenues from kudco  and o litigation settlements and related accruals the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates may differ under different assumptions or conditions and actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the company s inability to collect from certain customers 
as of december   the company had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of million  or of gross accounts receivable 
accounts receivable generated from the company s distribution operations are principally due from independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains which do not maintain their own central warehousing facilities  pharmacy buying groups and to a lesser extent physicians offices 
accounts receivable generated from the company s bioequivalent and brand product sales are principally due from a limited number of large warehousing pharmacy chains  wholesalers and large managed care customers 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is generally not required 
the company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  the percentage of accounts receivable by aging category and changes in customer payment terms or payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an increase to the allowance may be required 
also  should actual collections of accounts receivable be different than the company s estimates included in the determination of its allowance  the allowance will be increased or decreased through charges or credits to the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such changes in collection become known 
if conditions change in future periods  additional allowances or reversals may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
in august  andrx management learned that an employee had made numerous improper entries that affected the aging of certain customer accounts receivable and  accordingly  the adequacy of the company s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
after extensive investigation and analysis  including discussions with certain customers regarding past due amounts  management determined that the company s related provision for doubtful accounts receivable  included in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a was understated during  and  by an aggregate amount of million 
after consideration of all of the facts and circumstances  the company recognized the full amount of the million prior period misstatement in the second quarter of  as the company believes it is not material to any period affected 
activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is as follows years ended december  in thousands beginning balance  january    provision for doubtful accounts receivable   write offs  net of recoveries  ending balance  december     the provision for doubtful accounts receivable in of approximately million includes million related to prior years as discussed above 
additionally  the first and second quarters of required additional provisions of million  related to this matter 
since august  the company has continued aggressive follow up with its customers and has collected a significant amount of past due balances 
however  as certain other amounts were not collected and continue to age  the company has recorded additional provisions in the third and fourth quarters of as the likelihood of collection of those accounts has now decreased 
despite the increased allowance  the company continues to vigorously attempt to collect these balances 
additional provisions or reversals may result in future periods as actual collections may differ from the company s current estimates 
allowance for inventories inventories consist primarily of finished goods held for distribution  and raw materials  work in process and finished goods of andrx bioequivalent and brand products 
as of december   the company had million in inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost of inventories held for distribution is based on purchase price  net of vendor discounts  rebates and other allowances  but excludes shipping  warehousing and distribution costs which are expensed as incurred and reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
as appropriate  provisions through cost of goods sold are made to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
if conditions change in future periods  additional allowances may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
andrx has made  is in the process of making or will make commercial quantities of its product candidates prior to the date in which andrx anticipates that such products will receive fda final marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of the patent infringement litigation involving them ie pre launch inventory 
the commercial production of these products involves the risk that such product s may not be approved for marketing by fda on a timely basis or ever and or that the results of related litigation may not be satisfactory 
this risk notwithstanding  andrx plans to continue to scale up and build inventories of certain products that have not yet received final fda approval and or satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation  when it believes that such action is necessary and appropriate in relation to the commercial value of its product launch opportunity 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold includes charges totaling million  which consisted primarily of i a million charge for unusable pre launch inventories of the company s bioequivalent versions of prilosec  ii a million charge related to production of the company s other products and product candidates including the company s bioequivalent version of wellbutrin sr zyban  iii a million charge related to excess capacities at andrx s massachusetts aerosol facilities  including excess facility leases  leasehold improvements  aerosol product inventories  equipment and severance iv a million charge related to utilization issues at the company s davie  florida manufacturing facilities  and v an  charge related to start up costs for the company s weston  florida manufacturing facility 
as of december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories pending final fda approval and or satisfactory resolution of litigation 
in the first quarter of  andrx will provide an allowance included in cost of goods sold of million for additional pre launch inventories of generic wellbutrin sr zyban  not previously reserved in  for raw materials placed into production after december  sales allowances allowances against net sales for estimated returns  chargebacks and other sales allowances are established by the company concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the allowances are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including but not limited to  actual return experience by product type  the number and timing of competitive products approved for sale  both historical and projected  the market for the product  estimated customer inventory levels by product and current and projected economic conditions  levels of competition and price declines 
however  actual product returns  chargebacks and other sales allowances incurred are dependent upon future events 
the company periodically monitors the factors that influence sales allowances and makes adjustments to these provisions when management believes that actual product returns  chargebacks and other sales allowances may differ from established allowances 
if conditions in future periods change  additional allowances may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
net sales of the company s bioequivalent and brand products may be affected by the level of provisions for estimated sales allowances 
in the pharmaceutical industry  the practice is generally to grant customers the right to return or exchange purchased goods 
in the generic pharmaceutical industry  this practice has resulted in generic manufacturers issuing credits also known as shelf stock adjustments to customers based on the customers existing inventory following decreases in the market price of the related generic pharmaceutical product 
due to the competitive nature of the generic pharmaceutical industry  prices to customers are subject to frequent and significant price declines from existing and new competitors 
the determination to grant a credit to a customer following a price decrease is generally at the discretion of the company  and generally not pursuant to contractual arrangements with customers 
accordingly  the company makes significant accounting estimates  which include estimates of price declines and quantities shipped but still on customers shelves  before the products pull through the distribution channel 
the company accrues an estimate for the sales allowances in the same period the sale is recognized and continually reviews such estimates 
if conditions in future periods change  additional allowances or reversal may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
in connection with brand products  the company s significant accounting estimates for sales allowances are dependent on the company s ability to promote to physicians  create demand for products  pull products through the distribution channel and estimate returns  future levels of prescriptions for its products and the inventory levels in the distribution channel 
it is a common practice in the pharmaceutical industry for brand manufacturers to offer customers buy in allowances on initial purchases prior to promotion activities by the manufacturer 
all purchases by customers are generally subject to the right of return or exchange as a result of there being a limited number of large customers 
accordingly  concurrently with the recognition of revenues  the company is required to make significant accounting estimates related to such sales allowances  and to periodically review such estimates 
the company s policy is to recognize net sales to the extent it can reasonably estimate returns and the product being pulled through the distribution channel 
the ability to make such estimates is difficult when there is a high level of products in the distribution channel 
if conditions change in future periods  additional allowances or reversals may be required 
such additional allowances could be significant 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill  net in the consolidated balance sheet consisting of million from the acquisition of ctex pharmaceuticals  inc ctex in january and million from the acquisition of valmed pharmaceuticals  inc valmed in march prior to  the company measured impairment of goodwill using the undiscounted cash flow method whenever events and circumstances warranted revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment of goodwill 
the undiscounted cash flow method compared the net book value being tested to the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows 
if the net book value exceeded the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows  the excess carrying amount of goodwill is written off 
with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment in value by applying a fair value based test 
any applicable impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
if conditions in future periods change  impairment charges may be required 
such additional charges could be significant 
as of december   the company has million of other intangible assets  net in the consolidated balance sheet  which consisted primarily of million related to physicians online pol and million and million for product rights related to the entex and anexsia product lines  respectively 
brand product rights purchased from other pharmaceutical companies or acquired through the allocation of purchase price upon the acquisition of another entity  which are included in other intangible assets  are being amortized over periods ranging from three to ten years 
other intangible assets also include physicians network and trademarks  and patents relating to andrx s electronic prescription process  which are being amortized over periods ranging from four to fourteen years 
management established the amortization period based on an estimate of the period the assets would generate positive cash flow 
amortization was provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if conditions in future periods change  additional allowances may be required  which could be significant 
during  andrx recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets related to pol 
such charges were the result of management s decision in the fourth quarter of not to commit additional resources to and seek alternatives for and possibly the sale of pol and an evaluation of the goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of mediconsult and the subsequent integration of internet operations into andrx 
as a result  management believed that the future benefits previously associated with this transaction no longer existed under andrx s current operations 
on february   the fda announced that it intends to publish a federal register notice to describe its enforcement policy with respect to products such as the entex line of products with respect to products that are presently on the market without an approved anda or nda 
the entex line of products are prescription only products that did not require the submission and approval of an nda in order to be marketed 
as a result of the federal register notice  andrx may be required to seek fda approval for marketing the entex line of products and may be required to market some or all of these products as over the counter products 
upon issuance of definitive guidance on this matter  andrx will assess the unamortized portion of the entex product rights million as of december   and entex inventories  as of december  for any resulting impairment 
deferred income tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   the company has a million deferred income tax asset 
while the company has considered its ability to carry back certain net operating losses  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to the statements of operations in the period such determination was made 
previously the company recorded a valuation allowance of million on certain cybear net operating loss carryforwards 
due to a change in circumstances during  the company determined that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized and  accordingly  the company reversed the million valuation allowance 
as of december   the company determined that no valuation allowance was necessary on its deferred income tax assets after considering the ability to carry back certain net operating losses  future taxable income projections and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
licensing revenues from kudco in october  andrx entered into an agreement with genpharm and kudco  pursuant to which andrx and genpharm relinquished any marketing exclusivity rights to the mg and mg strengths of omeprazole generic prilosec  thereby accelerating the ability of kudco to receive final fda marketing approval for its version of that product  which kudco received on november  pursuant to the agreement  andrx is entitled to receive o of kudco s net profits  as defined in the agreement net profits  for approximately six months after the december   launch  o of kudco s net profits until the earlier of a the next twelve months  or b an appellate court decision  as defined in the agreement  and o of kudco s net profits during approximately the next months thereafter 
such licensing fees may also cease if either andrx or genpharm  who is also a party to that agreement with kudco  becomes lawfully permitted to launch its own bioequivalent version of prilosec 
under the provisions of the agreement  kudco is required to provide andrx with an estimate of andrx s licensing revenues for the month within days from the end of such month 
final licensing fee reports and payments to andrx on amounts earned in december and january are due to andrx days after the respective month end 
final licensing fee reports and amounts earned thereafter are due to andrx days after the respective month end 
based on the estimates received from kudco  andrx recorded million in estimated licensing revenues in the fourth quarter of  which includes the initial stocking of kudco s generic version of prilosec  commonly referred to as pipeline fill 
kudco estimates that licensing revenues earned by andrx for january and february will be approximately million and million  respectively 
future kudco licensing revenues will be dependent on a number of factors  including kudco s manufacturing capacity  market competition for prilosec and other factors outside of andrx s control 
the monthly licensing fee amounts due to andrx are subject to numerous estimates by kudco  including shelf stock adjustments  returns  discounts  rebate and other sales allowances and certain related expense items 
litigation settlements and related accruals the company accounts for the exposure of its various litigation matters under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires  among other things  an exposure to be accrued when it becomes probable and estimatable 
the company discloses possible significant exposure for legal matters in note no accrual or disclosure of legal exposures judged to be remote is required 
the exposure to legal matters is evaluated and estimated  if possible  based on  among other things  consultation with legal counsel 
such estimates are based on currently available information and their ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in these areas 
in july  andrx and aventis entered into a preliminary settlement with the direct purchaser class of plaintiffs in the cardizem cd antitrust litigation that is pending for multidistrict proceedings in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan 
the settlement  which is now binding  calls for a cash payment by andrx and aventis to this group in an undisclosed amount 
in anticipation of potentially reaching a settlement on certain litigation  andrx s results for the second quarter included an estimated litigation settlements charge of million 
this contingency became probable and estimable in june as a result of mediation discussions between the company and the plaintiffs through which the above settlement agreement was reached

distributed products net sales from distributed products increased by to million for  as compared to million for the increase in sales from distributed products reflects the participation in the distribution of generic products introduced by generic manufacturers  and an increase in sales to existing and new customers  generally offset by overall price declines  as is common with generic products 
for  sales from distributed products includes approximately million of andrx s participation in the distribution of generic prozac  which enjoyed marketing exclusivity from august through february in february  after the expiration of generic prozac s marketing exclusivity period  numerous competitors entered the market and the price declined in excess of  resulting in million in net sales from the distribution of generic prozac manufactured by other pharmaceutical companies 
in  net sales of distributed products generated million of gross profit with a gross margin of  as compared to million of gross profit with a gross margin of for such levels of gross margin on sales of distributed products are at the higher end of the historical range of  but which generally range from 
among other reasons  this increase in results from the company s participation in the distribution of numerous significant generic products that now face competition from multiple generic manufacturers  as well as the company s participation in other marketing opportunities 
products which face decreasing prices usually yield higher distribution gross margins but lowers sales prices  as described above 
the year included the high dollar volume net sales  but low gross margin distribution of generic prozac  during its august through february day market exclusivity period 
bioequivalent products for  net sales of andrx bioequivalent products decreased by to million  as compared to million in for and  net sales of andrx bioequivalent products include sales of the company s bioequivalent versions of cardizem cd  dilacor xr  ventolin metered dose inhalers and  commencing in  net sales of the company s bioequivalent versions of glucophage  k dur and naprelan 
the decrease in net sales of andrx bioequivalent products for as compared to related to a significant decline in net sales of andrx s bioequivalent version of ventolin and a decline in net sales of andrx s bioequivalent version of cardizem cd  partially offset by product launches 
net sales of andrx s bioequivalent version of ventolin were million during  as compared to million in  and the significant decrease began during the fourth quarter of and continued throughout  as a result of a marked increase in competition 
andrx s bioequivalent version of cardizem cd continues to generate significant levels of net sales and gross profits and materially contributes to andrx s overall current level of operating results 
net sales of andrx s bioequivalent products in include a  allowance for a november voluntary recall of the mg diltia xt capsules 
in  andrx s bioequivalent products generated million of gross profit with a gross margin of  as compared to million of gross profit with a gross margin of in primary contributors to this decrease in gross profit and gross margins were the october district court determination that the bioequivalent version of prilosec developed by andrx infringes valid patents nos

the decrease in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily the result of a lower level of net sales from the cough and cold product lines  and the absence of net sales from the histex product line after its june  sale  offset by net sales from anexsia  which the company began marketing in the fourth quarter of and altocor  which the company began marketing in the third quarter of net sales from the cough and cold product lines in were affected by  among other things  competition from generic introductions 
the company s policy is to recognize net sales of its brand products based on  among other things  prescription data provided by external independent sources  the amount of product it believes will be pulled through the distribution channel taking into account  among other things  inventory levels in the distribution channel  which the company periodically evaluates terms and incentives granted to customers  including the right of return 
in connection with altocor  however  there is a limited amount of prescription and product return history  the company has limited experience in marketing and selling cholesterol lowering products  and substantial incentives were granted to customers in connection with the product launch  including the right of return of initial stocking after nine months 
as a result  in  the company recorded approximately million in net sales of altocor on approximately million of net sales value of altocor shipments in net sales allowances are also recorded for the company s other brand products 
as a result  the company had million and million  respectively  in net sales allowances related to its brand products in its december  and  consolidated balance sheets  respectively

outlook distributed products during  the company generated million in net sales of distributed products 
the company s pharmaceutical distribution operation has a history of consistent quarterly sequential growth as a result of  among other things  generic introduction of new products by other generic manufacturers and the company s continued penetration of the market servicing independent pharmacies  pharmacy chains which do not maintain their own central warehousing facilities  pharmacy buying groups and  to a lesser extent  physicians offices 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to expand in this market  both in terms of per store volume and customer locations  particularly with the opening of its ohio distribution center in the second half of the company anticipates that the ohio distribution center will create additional distribution opportunities nationally by improving its ability to service various geographic regions 
the ability of the company to provide consistent sequential quarterly growth is affected  in large part  by the company s participation in the launch of new products by other generic manufacturers  and the advent and extent of competition encountered by these products  and the other products distributed by the company 
sales prices for products typically decline with the advent of competition particularly such products had an initial exclusivity period 
as an example  the company s net sales of distributed products in included approximately million from the distribution of generic prozac  which had a day marketing exclusivity beginning in august upon the expiration of that exclusivity in january  numerous generic manufacturers entered the market and the price declined by more than in andrx s net sales for for the distribution of generic prozac were million 
consequently  growth in net sales will continue to primarily be a function of new generic products launched by other generic manufacturers  offset by the overall level of net price declines on existing distributed products 
andrx s pharmaceutical distribution business competes with a number of large wholesalers which market both brand and bioequivalent pharmaceutical products to their customers and may offer broader marketing programs 
andrx also competes with other distributors of pharmaceuticals 
though the distribution business is historically a low margin industry  andrx believes that consolidation among wholesalers who already had far greater financial and other resources than andrx  the growing role of managed care organizations  the formation of buying groups and competition between distributors could result in increased price reductions 
nevertheless  the company s distribution operation is expected to continue to grow at a rate consistent with the growth of the overall generic industry 
the company s distribution operation will participate and play a significant role in the launch of andrx s bioequivalent products 
for external reporting purposes  this segment s financial results do not include its participation in the distribution of andrx bioequivalent products 
such sales are classified as andrx product sales in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
andrx bioequivalent products during  the company generated net sales of million from its bioequivalent products including sales of andrx products by the company s distribution operations  which included million in sales of the company s bioequivalent versions of cardizem cd  dilacor xr and ventolin and million in sales from the company s bioequivalent versions  k dur  naprelan and glucophage launched in the company s bioequivalent products generated gross profits of million and a gross margin of in the bioequivalent pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and selling prices are often subject to significant and rapid declines from competition among existing or new bioequivalent manufacturers entering the market 
in andrx s sales efforts for its bioequivalent products  andrx competes with domestic and international companies and bioequivalent divisions of large brand pharmaceutical companies 
many of these competitors offer a wider variety of bioequivalent products to their customers 
as patents and other basis for market exclusivity expire  bioequivalent competitors enter the marketplace 
normally  there is a unit price decline as the number of bioequivalent competitors increases 
the timing of these price decreases is difficult to predict and can result in a significantly curtailed profitability for a bioequivalent product 
in addition  andrx s bioequivalent products may be affected by competition involving the corresponding brand product  including the introduction and promotion of either alternative branded versions or otc versions of such products 
as a result  andrx s bioequivalent version of cardizem cd continues to generate significant net sales for the company 
as a third competitor to cardizem cd is expected to begin selling its product in or  this new competitor or other lesser factors may significantly affect net sales and gross profits of andrx s bioequivalent version of cardizem cd and its material contribution to andrx s results of operations 
the company believes its controlled release products will face more modest competition than other bioequivalent products due to the limited number of competitors having the scientific expertise  legal expertise  and financial resources  necessary to develop these products and bring them to market 
the company also believes that  for various reasons  its specialty or niche bioequivalent products may also face less competition than most bioequivalent products 
these competitive barriers  combined with the synergistic value derived from the company s pharmaceutical distribution operation  are intended to better position the company to compete in the highly competitive bioequivalent product marketplace 
currently  andrx s overall level of profitability remains dependant on a relatively small number of products and andrx s ability to successfully manufacture sufficient quantities of these products on a timely basis 
if these products  and particularly andrx s bioequivalent version of cardizem cd  were to experience increased competition  and the resulting price reductions and or reduced market shares  andrx s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
for an example  increased competition  commencing in the fourth quarter of  for the company s bioequivalent version of ventolin and continued throughout  resulted in a substantial reduction in the company s sales from that product and its overall profitability 
future growth in the bioequivalent products business will be generated from the launch of new products 
the most significant of andrx s product candidates are wellbutrin sr zyban  tiazac and the claritin family of products claritin d  claritin d  and claritin reditabs  all of which have been converted into otc products by the brand holder 
the timing of these product launches is dependent upon a number of factors  including factors outside of the company s control 
these factors include the receipt of fda final marketing approval  new orange book patent listings and related patent infringement litigation  the expiration of other s exclusivity rights  and the favorable resolution of patent litigation 
the net sales and gross profits to be generated by these new products will also be affected by the amount of bioequivalent competition they encounter  particularly after the expiration of any day exclusivity period that the company anticipates having  either alone or shared 
andrx has made  is in the process of making or will make commercial quantities of certain new products prior to the date in which andrx anticipates that such products will receive fda final marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of the patent infringement litigation involving them 
the commercial production of these products involves the risk that such product s may not be approved for marketing by the fda on a timely basis or ever and or that the results of such litigation may not be satisfactory 
this risk notwithstanding  andrx plans to continue to scale up and build inventories of certain products that have not yet received final fda marketing approval and or satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation  when it believes that such action is necessary and appropriate in relation to the commercial value of its product launch opportunity including an exclusivity period 
in late february  andrx proposed amendments to its andas for its bioequivalent versions of wellbutrin sr zyban  even though it believed that those andas were nearing the last stages of fda s final approval process  and it was in the late stage of the process of building launch quantities for these products 
this action was taken to change a specification which andrx had previously agreed to  but later determined  based upon additional manufacturing experience and analysis  should be changed 
though andrx has supplied scientific evidence that this issue only affects expiration dating  and not the efficacy or safety of the products  and is consistent with the fda s guidance on impurities  the fda has advised that the specification that it previously agreed to needs to be further revised  in a manner adverse to the company s position  as a result of updated usp specifications that the fda is now seeking to enforce 
the company is in discussions with the fda and usp on this issue  and cannot at this time accurately advise whether or when such issues will be satisfactorily resolved or these product introductions will occur 
the fda granted final marketing approval for claritin d in february  and andrx anticipates that perrigo  its licensee  will commence selling this product as a store brand  in mid the company believes that the only substantive matter delaying approval of andrx s bioequivalent versions of claritin d and claritin reditabs is the expiration of the day market exclusivity period for each of those products 
the company also believes that its bioequivalent version of tiazac is nearing fda final marketing approval 
andrx brand products in its brand products business  andrx began to ship and promote altocor  it s first internally developed product  in july  and recorded approximately million in net sales of altocor on shipments of approximately million estimated net sales value in andrx deferred recognition of the net sales relating to a significant portion of the shipments of altocor  given the limited amount of prescription and return history and the sales terms and incentives offered to customers which included a right of return of initial stocking 
though current sales and marketing trends would equate to net sales of altocor of approximately million  a number of new sales and marketing initiatives have been or are in the process of being implemented which management believes will increase such sales to approximately million 
with altocor s launch  the company has entered a highly competitive market against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers having significantly larger and more experienced sales forces and significantly greater financial resources dedicated to advertising and promotion 
net sales for altocor will be subject to significant accounting estimates for  among other things  the ability of the company s sales force to promote to physicians  generate product demand and pull product through the distribution channel  and the company s ability to estimate returns 
the company s estimate of returns will be based on  among other things  terms offered to customers and an estimate of expected prescription levels 
consistent with industry practice  the company may offer allowances on initial purchases and generally provide for a right of return or exchange 
as low prescription levels of altocor are anticipated during the early stages of the launch  sales  marketing  advertising and promotional costs will exceed gross profits from net sales of altocor until a profitable sales level is achieved 
andrx s application for a registered trademark for altocor has been opposed by kos pharmaceuticals  who alleges that there is a likelihood of confusion between kos trademark  advicor  and altocor 
andrx has requested fda guidance on other names  and may seek to change the name of altocor

on february   the fda announced that it intends to publish a federal register notice to describe its enforcement policy with respect to products such as the entex line of products with respect to products that are presently on the market without an approved anda or nda 
the entex line of products are prescription only products that did not require the submission and approval of an nda in order to be marketed

such licensing fees may also cease if andrx or genpharm  who is also a party to that agreement with kudco  becomes lawfully permitted to launch its own bioequivalent version of prilosec 
andrx earned million in estimated licensing revenues in the month of december  which includes the initial stocking of kudco s generic version of prilosec  commonly referred to as pipeline fill 
kudco estimates that license revenues earned by andrx for january and february will be approximately million and million  respectively 
future kudco licensing revenues will be dependent on a number of factors  including  among other things  kudco s manufacturing capacity  market competition for prilosec and other factors outside of andrx s control 
payments to andrx on amounts earned in december and january are due to andrx days after the respective month end 
amounts earned thereafter are due to andrx days after the respective month end

moreover  because andrx manufactures products that employ a variety of technology platforms  certain of its manufacturing capabilities were over utilized  while others were underutilized  and inefficiencies  equipment failures and rejected lots at times interrupted andrx s ability to fully meet the actual demand for certain of its marketed products 
andrx has taken a number of steps to address these problems  including the acquisition of a new facility in morrisville  north carolina 
though andrx previously announced its intention to have the first phase of this facility operational in  the company is re evaluating this determination as a result of the recent issues surrounding the approval and marketing of the company s bioequivalent version of wellbutrin sr zyban 
depending on the company s ultimate determination of this matter  the timing and outcome of the issues involving the marketing of the company s bioequivalent versions of prilosec and or wellbutrin sr zyban  and the manufacturing quantities of such products required in the event the company were to launch this product  the company may not be able to meet the market demand for all of the products it is currently manufacturing and in its pipeline 
throughout  andrx will continue to focus on improving its pharmaceutical manufacturing operations 
andrx s weston  florida manufacturing facility is expected to become fully operational by and will produce specialty  niche and immediate release products  including oral contraceptives
