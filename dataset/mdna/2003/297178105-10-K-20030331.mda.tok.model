critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to acquiring  developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties  its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and qualification as a reit 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
development costs include acquisition  direct and indirect construction costs  interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods 
maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred 
asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring contract performance for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability 
even if we continue to qualify as a reit  we will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

these factors include economic environment both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns  manages and develops properties have been and continue to be in a recession 
this has resulted in reduced occupancy rates  increased concessions and reductions in market rental rates 
the company s property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which the company operates 
although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead  it is possible that further reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues  operating income  cash flows  and the market value of the company s shares 
a prolonged recession could also affect the company s ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices 
interest rate fluctuations the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective 
however  current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels 
the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt see item a and notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company s ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the company s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
inflation inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on property operating results and such increases may be at a greater rate than property rental rates 
the company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses  but realizes that higher annual rates of inflation could result in increases to operating expense

funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined under gaap 
further  funds from operations as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of funds from operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
for the years ended december there after total fair value in thousands fixed rate debt       average interest rate variable rate libor debt 
   average interest rate capped at interest rates ranging from to the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
