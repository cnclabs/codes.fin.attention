statement of forward looking information certain statements in the section are forward looking statements 
you should read the information before part i above  special note regarding forward looking statements for more information about our presentation of information 
background we have reported net income only from through since  we have incurred  as expected  substantial operating losses due to our conducting clinical testing 
prior to completing an initial public offering ipo in november  we financed operations primarily through the private placement of equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  interest income and revenues from licensing  royalty agreements and cost recovery treatment programs 
we have established a strong foundation of laboratory  pre clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acid to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and the development of the therapeutic products for the treatment of chronic disease 
our strategy is to obtain the required regulatory approval which will allow the progressive introduction of ampligen r our proprietary drug for treating myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic syndrome me cfs  hiv  hepatitis c hcv and hepatitis b hbv in the us  canada  europe and japan 
ampligen r is currently in phase iii clinical trials in the us for use in treatment of me cfs and is in phase iib clinical trials in the us for the treatment of newly emerged multi drug resistant hiv  and for the induction of cell mediated immudity in hiv patients that are under control using potentially toxic drug cocktail 
our proprietary drug technology utilizes specifically configured ribonucleic acid rna and is protected by more than patents worldwide 
with over additional patent application pending to provide further proprietary protection in various international markets 
certain patents apply to the use of ampligen r alone and certain patent apply to the use of ampligen r in combination with certain other drugs 
some composition of matter patents pertain to other new medication  which have a similar mechanism of action 
in march   the company acquired from interferon sciences inc isi  all of isi s raw materials  work in progress and finished product of alferon n injection r  together with a limited license for the production  manufacture  use  marketing and sale of the product 
alferon n injection r 
interferon alfa n human derived 
is a natural alpha interferon that has been approved by the us food and drug administration fda for commercial sale for the treatment of certain types of genital warts 
we intend to market this product in the united state through sales facilitated via third party marketing agreements 
additionally  we intend to implement studies  beyond those conducted by isi  for testing the potential treatment of hiv  hepatitis c and other indications  including multiple sclerosis 
this acquisition not withstanding  our primary focus remains the development to ampligen r for treating me cfs and hiv diseases 
we are incorporated in maryland in under the name hem research  inc  and originally served as a supplier of research support products 
our business was redirected in the early s to the development of nucleic acid pharmaceutical technology and the commercialization of rna drugs 
we were reincorporated in delaware and changed our name to hem pharmaceutical corp 
in and to hemispherx biopharma  inc  in june we have three domestic subsidiaries biopro corp  bioaegean corp  and core biotech corp  all of which are incorporated in delaware 
our foreign subsidiaries include hemispherx biopharma europe nv sa established in belgium in and hemispherx biopharma europe sa incorporated in luxembourg in result of operations years ended december  vs 
net loss our net loss was approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of  in per share losses in was cents versus a per share loss of cents in this year to year decrease in losses of  is primarily due to higher revenues and lower costs in revenues were up  in and total expenses were down by  offset by a write down in the carrying value of our investments in the amount of  for a net cost decrease of  revenues our revenues have come from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe 
these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
revenues from cost recovery treatment programs totaled some  in in  these revenues were  or higher than revenues 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to the focus of our clinical resources on conducting and completing the amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial as well as the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the data collected in the us phase iii me cfs trial 
we received a licensing fee of  euros some  from esteve 
pursuant to a sales and distribution agreement  esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen r in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs in turn we provided to esteve technical scientific and commercial information 
the agreement terms require no additional performance by us 
our total revenues  including this licensing fee  in was  compared to revenues of  in revenues for non refundable license fees are recognized under the performance method 
this method recognizes revenue to the extent of performance to date under a licensing agreement 
in computing earned revenue  it considers only the amount of non refundable cash actually received to date 
this method considers future payments to be contingent and thus ignores the possibility of future milestone payments when computing the amount of revenue earned in a current period 
research and development costs our efforts in research and development are fully directed toward conducting and completing our ongoing clinical trials  a phase iii study for the treatment of me cfs an two phase iib studies for the treatment of hiv 
our r d direct costs were  in compared with  in the phase iii study  amp for the treatment of me cfs is a multi center  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating me cfs patients with ampligen r 
as of december  the study was fully enrolled 
more than patients have finished the study and we expect to finish with the current groups by the fourth quarter of expenses related to the me cfs phase iii study are expected to decrease in because of fewer patients to be treated in the cost intensive segment of the program as the trial nears completion 
the phase iib clinical trail amp salvage therapy for the treatment of hiv evaluates the use of ampligen in adjunct to haart therapy 
the phase iib clinical trial amp  strategic treatment therapy evaluates the effect of ampligen r during haart treatment interruptions  or so called drug holidays 
as of february  approximately patients have been enrolled in both studies combined and are being treated in approximately different active sites 
we expect an acceleration in enrollment in the months ahead  now that more data about the trials is known by the medical community 
therefore  the lower cost of the me cfs program will be partially offset by an increase due to spending related to the acceleration of our two hiv clinical trials 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in placed in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv 
there could be competition for the same patient population 
overall  we expect our research and development costs to be lower by over  in as compared to upon completion of the me cfs study  we will start analyzing the clinical data to determine the results of the study in anticipation of submitting an application to the fda in early to mid the hiv trials will continue into delays in patient recruiting for the hiv trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial 
general and administrative expenses excluding stock compensation expense  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in versus  in this decease in expenses of  in  is due to several factors including the recovery of certain legal expenses of approximately  relating to the asensio lawsuit from our insurance carrier and lower overall legal expenses due to less litigation  partially offset by higher insurance premiums 
stock compensation expenses was  or  lower than recorded in the year the compensation reflects the imputed non cash expense recorded to reflect the cost of warrants granted to outside parties for services rendered to the company 
equity loss unconsolidated affiliates during the three months ended june and december  we recorded a non cash charge of  and  respectively  to operations with respect to our  investment in red these charges were the result of our determination that red s business and financial position had deteriorated to the point that our investment had been permanently impaired 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
in may  we acquired an equity interest in chronix biomedical corp 
chronix 
for  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a noncash charge of  with respect to our investment in chronix 
this impairment reduces our carrying value to reflect a permanent decline in chronix s market value based on their current proposed equity offerings 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
in april  we acquired a equity position in the california institute of molecular medicine cimm for  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in cimm 
this was a result of our determination that cimm s operations have not yet evolved to the point where the full carrying value of our investment could be supported based on that company s financial position and operating results 
this amount represented the unamortized balance of goodwill included as part of our investment 
during  we wrote down to zero our remaining investment based on that company s continuing operating losses 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption equity loss in unconsolidated affiliate 
please see research and development collaborative agreements in part for more details on these transactions 
other income expense interest and other income totaled  in compared to  recorded in significantly lower interest rates on money market accounts and lower cash available for investment basically account for the difference 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities which earned much lower interest income in years ended december  vs 
net loss we reported a net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  versus a net loss of approximately  for the year the increase in losses of  in was basically due to lower me cfs cost recovery treatment revenues and interest income 
in addition we recorded a non operating  non cash charge of  with respect to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
this amount represents the unamortized balance of goodwill included in the investments 
overall operating expenses in were  lower than operating expenses experienced in our loss per share was in and revenues at this time  prior to the acquisition of alferon n our revenues come from our me cfs cost recovery treatment programs principally underway in the us  canada and europe 
these clinical programs allow us to provide ampligen r therapy at our cost to severely debilitated me cfs patients 
under this program the patients pay for the cost of ampligen r doses infused 
these costs total approximately  for a weeks treatment program 
revenues from cost recovery treatment programs totaled some  in in  these revenues declined by  or 
we expected revenues in the us to decline due to the focus of our clinical resources on conducting and completing the amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial as well as the start up of the amp and amp hiv clinical trials 
revenues from the european cost recovery treatment programs were lower than expected primarily due to our european investigators spending a great deal of time in reviewing and analyzing the clinical data collected in the treatment of some patients in belgium 
the clinical data collected from treating patients under the cost recovery treatment programs will augment and supplement the data collected in the us phase iii me cfs trial 
research and development costs as previously noted  our research and development is primarily directed at developing our lead product  ampligen r  as a therapy for use in treating various chronic illnesses as well as cancer 
in and  most of this effort was directed toward conducting and supporting clinical trials involving patients affected with me cfs 
our research and development direct costs were  in compared to  spent in the lower research and development costs basically reflect the net sum of less costs related to lower cost recovery treatment revenues and lower expenses related to the me cfs clinical trials offset by increased purchases of polymers and increased expenses relating to the hiv trials initiated in as to be expected  costs related to the cost recovery treatment programs were down approximately  due to lower revenues recorded in also expenses relating to the me cfs phase iii clinical trial were down some  in versus due to fewer patients being treated in the cost intensive segment of the program as the clinical trial nears completion 
this clinical trial is a multicenter  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treating me cfs patients with ampligen r 
as of february  more than patients have been enrolled 
these lower costs relating to our me cfs programs were partially offset by an increase in polymer purchase in in the amount of  and an increase due to spending on the new hiv clinical trials now underway 
the polymer purchase increase was needed to boost our on hand inventory for the production of ampligen r 
the hiv clinical trials were initiated to evaluate the use of ampligen r in concert with other antiviral drugs in treating patients severely afflicted with aids 
we expect levels of these clinical trials to continue throughout refer to part i  item business for more information on our research and development for programs 
general and administrative expenses excluding stock compensation expense  general and administrative expenses were approximately  in versus  in the decrease in expense is primary due to lower professional fees in all other general and administrative expenses were slightly less than recorded in stock compensation expenses were  or some  higher than recorded in the year the compensation reflects the imputed non cash expense recorded to reflect the cost of warrants granted to outside parties for services rendered to the company 
equity loss unconsolidated affiliates during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of  with respect to our investment in cimm 
the amount represents the unamortized balance of goodwill included as part of our investment 
this was a result of management s determination that cimm s operations had not yet evolved to the point where our full carrying value of its investment could be supported based on their financial position and operating results 
other income expense interest and other income of  in was lower than the  recorded in significantly lower interest rates on money market accounts and lower cash available for investment basically account for the difference 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities which earned much lower interest income in liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were approximately  cash used for operating activities in was  additional uses of cash included expenditures of  for patent acquisition cost  and  to acquire  shares of our stock 
cash proceeds from financing activities in were approximately   was received from stock subscriptions and  was received from the issuance of preferred equity certificates of our european subsidiary 
our net operating cash burn rate for the last three months of fiscal year approximated  per month or  on an annualized basis 
all clinical trial drug supplies produced in were fully expensed although some costs are expected to be recovered under the expanded access cost recovery programs authorized by fda and regulatory bodies in other countries 
our operating cash burn rate should decline in as the amp me cfs clinical trial nears completion and the cost of european market development activity is reduced

on march   we issued an aggregate of  in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due march and an aggregate of  warrants to two investors in a private placement for aggregate anticipated gross proceeds of  pursuant to the terms of the debentures   of the proceeds from the sale of the debentures have been held back and will be released to us if  and only if  we acquire isi s facility with in a set timeframe see the discussion below 
the debentures mature on january  and bear interest at per annum  payable quarterly in cash or  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  common stock 
any shares of common stock issued to the investors as payment of interest shall be valued at of the average closing price of the common stock during the five consecutive business days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the senior convertible debentures  we have pledged all of our assets  other than our intellectual property  as collateral and are subject to comply with certain financial and negative covenants  which include but are not limited to the repayment of principal balances upon achieving certain revenue milestone 
the debentures are convertible at the option of the investors at any time through january  into shares of our common stock 
the conversion price under the debentures is fixed at per share  subject to adjustment for anti dilution protection for issuance of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock at a price less than the conversion price then in effect

in accordance with this agreement  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
the investors include portside growth opportunity fund ltd 
and leonardo  lp the debentures mature on march  and bear interest at per annum  payable quarterly in cash or common stock 
any shares of common stock issued to the investors as payment of interest shall be valued at of the average closing price of the common stock during the five consecutive business days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date 
on march   we acquired from interferon sciences  inc isi isi s inventory of alferon n injection r  a pharmaceutical product used for the treatment of certain types of genital warts  and a limited license for the production  manufacturing  use  marketing and sale of this product 
as partial consideration  we issued  shares of our common stock to isi 
pursuant to our agreements with isi  we are in the process of registering the foregoing shares for public sale 
on march   we also entered into an agreement to purchase from isi all of its rights to the product and other assets related to the product including  but not limited to  real estate and machinery 
for these assets  we have agreed to issue to isi an additional  shares and to issue  shares and  shares  respectively to the american national red cross and gp strategies corporation  two creditors of isi 
the company also will be required to satisfy real estate taxes and utility expenses of isi which totaled  as of december  and which are secured by a lien on the real estate to be acquired by the company 
we have guaranteed the market value of all but  of these share on terms substantially similar to those for the initial acquisition of the isi assets 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and short term investments 
we believe that these funds plus the anticipated infusion of approximately million in net proceeds from the debenture placement  projected net cash flow from the acquisition of the alferon n business and the funds received from the insurance settlement should be sufficient to meet our operating requirement during the next months 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
because of our long term capital requirements  we may seek to access the public equity market whenever conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or method used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenues for non refundable license fees are recognized under the performance method 
this method recognizes revenue to the extent of performance to date under a licensing agreement 
in computing earned revenue  it considers only the amount of non refundable cash actually received to date 
this method considers future payments to be contingent and thus ignores the possibility of future milestone payments when computing the amount of revenue earned in a current period 
revenue from the sale of ampligen r under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when treatment is provided to the patient 
patents and trademarks effective october   we adopted a year estimated useful life for the amortization of our patents and trademark rights in order to more accurately reflect their useful life 
prior to october   we were using a ten year estimated useful life 
patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the assets 
the company reviews its patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential on an undiscounted cash basis to support the realizability of its respective capitalized cost 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into company s strategic business plans 
research and developments costs research and development costs are direct costs related to both future and present products and are charged to operations as incurred 
the company recognized research and development costs of   and  in  and respectively 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative market risk 
market risk we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding requirements  the excess cash was invested in three to six month high quality financial instruments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to any investment exposure
