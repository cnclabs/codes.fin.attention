item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of future losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
net income the company reported earnings of million in  representing a increase from the million earned in  which was over earnings of million 
components of net income year ended december  in thousands net interest and fee income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense taxes net income net income per average fully diluted share net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average total assets fully taxable equivalent fte earnings in increased million or compared to  primarily due to higher net interest and fee income fte  which grew by million or 
approximately eighty seven percent of that increase was due to growth of earning assets  including from the acquisition of kerman state bank ksb and the remainder to a higher net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income exceeded a significant decline in noninterest income and a slight increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest income reflected a million charge for the impairment of investment securities 
the provision for income taxes fte increased million or primarily due to higher pretax income 
most of the improvement in earnings was also the result of greater net interest income  which increased by million or compared to approximately million of that increase was due to a higher level of average earning assets and the remainder to a higher net interest margin 
much of the average earning asset growth was due to the acquisition of first counties bank in mid the loan loss provision was reduced slightly and noninterest income grew million or 
partially offsetting this higher revenue  noninterest expense rose million  or 
the tax provision fte increased million or 
the company s return on average total assets was in  compared to and in and  respectively 
return on average equity in was  compared to and in the two previous years 
net interest income the company s primary source of revenue is net interest income  or the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income fte in increased million or from  to million 
comparing to  net interest income fte increased million or 
components of net interest income year ended december  in thousands interest and fee income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte net interest margin fte interest and fee income fte fell million or from to  the net result of declining yields on earning assets and the effect of volume growth of earning assets 
the total yield on earning assets fell from in to in  following the general trend in interest markets in which short term rates decreased an average of over basis points and medium term rates by more than basis points 
the most significant yield declines in the loan portfolio were as follows commercial loans down from to  or basis points  construction loans down from to  or basis points and personal lines of credit down from to or basis points 
the investment portfolio yield fell basis points to with the largest decline occurring in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations down from to or basis points 
the lower yields caused interest income to decline by million  which was offset by the million effect of growth in average earning assets up million to  million in 
interest expense fell million or from to primarily due to a lower cost of funds 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped basis points to 
notable decreases were on federal funds purchased down from to  jumbo cds down from to  public cds down from to and preferred money market deposits down from to 
interest expense decreased by a net thousand due to volume related factors 
volume related expense was reduced due to a change in mix to lower rate deposits  including an increase in noninterest bearing balances 
the interest expense due to an increase in average federal home loan bank advances of million largely offset the benefit of lower rate deposits 
interest and fee income fte decreased million or from to  due to the net effect of lower earning asset yields and a favorable change in the mix of those assets 
the total yield on earning assets dropped from in to in the greatest decrease was on commercial loans down from to  or basis points  with relatively stable consumer loan yields declining basis points 
the investment portfolio yield was unchanged 
the effect of lower yields reduced interest income by million 
the total level of earning assets remained unchanged  however  a shift from lower yielding investment securities to more profitable loans resulted in a million improvement in interest income 
interest expense decreased million or in compared to  principally due to lower interest rates 
the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  basis points or lower than in the most pronounced declines included rates paid on shorter term liabilities such as federal funds purchased down from to and public time deposits down from to 
rates paid on transaction deposit accounts decreased basis points 
this decrease had the effect of lowering the company s interest costs by million 
in addition  as a result of continuing marketing efforts to acquire commercial relationships  noninterest bearing balances increased  indirectly causing interest expense to decline an additional million 
the following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  the amounts of interest income from average earning assets and the resulting yields  and the amount of interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
average loan balances include nonperforming loans 
interest income includes proceeds from loans on nonaccrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income 
yields on securities and certain loans have been adjusted upward to reflect the effect of income exempt from federal income taxation at the current statutory tax rate

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us treasury  us government agencies and corporations  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the held to maturity portfolio is to maintain a prudent yield and provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the investments held to maturity had an average term to maturity of months at december  and  on the same date  those investments included million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the company s liquidity 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  and are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a credit or charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the company held million classified as investments available for sale

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and to increase diversification of the loan portfolio 
credit reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified loans category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of management attention to ensure collection 
classified loans and other real estate owned the following summarizes the company s classified loans for the periods indicated classified loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands classified loans other real estate owned total classified loans at december  increased million or to million from december   due to million in classified loans acquired through the ksb acquisition and new downgrades  partially reduced by upgrades and payoffs 
other real estate owned decreased thousand from the prior year  due to sales and writedowns of properties acquired in satisfaction of debt  partially offset by new foreclosures on real estate collateralizing loans 
nonperforming loans nonperforming credits include nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing and other real estate owned 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon reaching days or more delinquent  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonperforming credits 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that time are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
performing nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated nonperforming loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands performing nonaccrual loans nonperforming nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total nonperforming loans and oreo allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and oreo performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand and thousand above levels  respectively 
most performing nonaccrual loans from a year ago were either paid off or returned to accrual status and other loans were downgraded 
the increase in nonperforming loans was the net result of downgrades and million of loans remaining on nonaccrual since  partially reduced by payoffs and upgrades 
the thousand decline of other real estate owned balances at december  was due to sales of most properties from  partially offset by an addition of one large property recorded at thousand 
performing nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand below the level of a year earlier  while nonperforming loans increased thousand 
with the exception of three relationships totaling million  all loans on nonaccrual status in were either paid off or brought current in  with the net result of total nonaccrual loans remaining approximately unchanged 
all foreclosed property owned in was disposed of at a small gain during  the thousand owned at december  consisted of seven small parcels 
the company had no restructured loans as of december  and the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded if all nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period  was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared with thousand in and thousand in management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  total nonperforming assets could fluctuate from year to year 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming loans and oreo at their current levels  however  no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
loan loss experience the company s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based upon specific borrower conditions  credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the allowance is allocated to segments of the loan portfolio based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified loan balances are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard allocation percentages 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical rate of net losses and delinquency trends grouped by the number of days the payments on those loans are delinquent 
a portion of the allowance is also allocated to impaired loans 
management considers the million allowance for loan losses  which is equivalent to of total loans at december   to be adequate as a reserve against inherent losses 
however  while the company s policy is to charge off in the current period those loans on which the loss is considered probable  the risk exists of future losses which cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
management continues to evaluate the loan portfolio and assess current economic conditions that will dictate future allowance levels 
the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated loan loss allowance  chargeoffs recoveries year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding average loans outstanding during the period analysis of the allowance balance  beginning of period additions to the allowance charged to operating expense allowance acquired through merger loans charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total chargeoffs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total recoveries net loan losses balance  end of period net loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding allocation of the allowance for loan losses the following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december for the years indicated allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december  allocation loans as allocation loans as allocation loans as allocation loans as allocation loans as of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent of the percent allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total allowance of total balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans balance loans dollars in thousands commercial real estate construction real estate residential consumer unallocated portion total impaired loans the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
the company considers classified loans below the established thresholds to represent immaterial credit risk 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are in nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the periods indicated impaired loans year ended december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans other total impaired loans specific reserves the million balance of impaired loans as of december   other than nonaccrual loans  is due to one commercial real estate loan having collateral exposure that may preclude ultimate full repayment 
payment on this credit was current as of december  average impaired loans for the year ended december  were million compared to million in portions of the company s allowance for credit losses were allocated to each of these impaired loans 
in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructurings or loans that are classified as nonaccrual 
for other impaired loans  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may increase the company s interest rate risk position in order to increase its net interest margin 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the primary analytical tool used by the company to quantify interest rate risk is a simulation model to project changes in net interest income nii that result from forecast changes in interest rates 
this analysis calculates the difference between a nii forecast over a month period using a flat interest rate scenario and a nii forecast using a rising or falling rate scenario  where the federal funds rate  serving as a driver  is made to rise by basis points or fall by basis points over the month forecast interval triggering a response in the other rates 
company policy requires that such simulated changes in nii should always be within certain specified ranges or steps must be taken to reduce interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes the simulated change in nii  based on the month period ending december  simulated changes to net interest income estimated increase decrease in nii estimated changes in interest rates basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions estimated increase decrease in nii estimated changes in interest rates basis points nii amount amount percent dollars in millions the following table summarizes the interest rate sensitivity gaps inherent in the company s asset and liability portfolios at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis repricing within days non over repricing total dollars in thousands assets investment securities loans other assets total assets liabilities noninterest bearing interest bearing transaction money market savings passbook savings time short term borrowings federal home loan bank advances debt financing and notes payable other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net liabilities assets subject to repricing cumulative net liabilities assets subject to repricing the repricing terms of the table above do not represent contractual principal maturities  but rather principal cash flows available for repricing 
the interest rate sensitivity report shown above categorizes interest bearing transaction deposits and savings deposits as repricing within days 
however  it is the experience of management that the historical interest rate volatility of these interest bearing transaction and savings deposits can be similar to liabilities with longer repricing dates  depending on market conditions 
moreover  the degree to which these deposits respond to changes in money market rates usually is less than the response of interest rate sensitivity loans 
these factors cause the cumulative net liability position shown above to indicate a much greater degree of liability sensitivity than management believes really exists based on the additional analysis previously discussed

the purchase obligation consists of the company s minimum liability under a contract with a third party automated services provider 
management believes the company will maintain its cash levels through the end of mainly due to increased profitability and retained earnings 
it is anticipated that loan demand will continue to increase moderately  although demand for loans will be dictated by economic conditions 
the growth of deposit balances is expected to exceed the anticipated growth in loan demand through the end of the investment securities portfolio is expected to increase 
however  due to concerns regarding possible terrorist attacks and geo political risks there is considerable uncertainty in the general economic environment which may impact loan demand and levels of customer deposits 
it is anticipated that share repurchases will also continue in from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors 
capital resources the current and projected capital position of the company and the impact of capital plans and long term strategies is reviewed regularly by management 
the company s capital position represents the level of capital available to support continued operations and expansion 
the company annually repurchases approximately million of its shares of common stock in the open market with the intention of lessening the dilutive impact of issuing new shares to meet employee stock awards  option plans  and other ongoing requirements 
in addition to these systematic repurchases  other programs have been implemented to optimize the company s use of equity capital and enhance shareholder value 
pursuant to these programs  the company repurchased an additional thousand shares in  million shares in and million shares in the company s primary capital resource is shareholders equity  which increased million or from the previous year  the net result of profits earned during the year and an unrealized gain on securities  reduced by dividends paid and the effect of the company s ongoing share repurchase program
