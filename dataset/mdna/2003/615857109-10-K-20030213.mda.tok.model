according to printing impressions  a leading industry publication  moore is the third largest diversified printing company in north america based on revenues 
the corporation offers its products and services principally in the united states and canada  but it also has operations in europe and in latin america  primarily in mexico and brazil

like many other companies  net sales in and have been affected by the economic downturn in the united states 
historically  net sales have not been materially affected by seasonal factors 
the corporation s financial results for the periods discussed herein have been affected by changes in business strategy and restructuring actions 
in early  the management team initiated a business strategy to maximize margins and capitalize on the corporation s core competencies 
as a result  management realigned the operating segments  restructured the operations  disposed of non core businesses  exited unprofitable accounts and product lines and acquired complementary businesses 
these initiatives have resulted in improved performance during  relative to last year 
consistent with the strategy to focus on core printing operations  the corporation disposed of various non core businesses 
in the first quarter of  the corporation sold colleagues  its uk based advertising agency and its investment in an on line real estate listing company 
in the fourth quarter of  the corporation disposed of phoenix  its detroit based telemarketing customer relationship management business 
in and during  the corporation also disposed of several of its interests in non us investments that were no longer strategic or where the corporation lacked sufficient control to achieve its objectives 
the corporation has completed various acquisitions complementary to its core operations 
in december  the corporation acquired document management services  the print and mail business of ibm canada limited 
in january  the corporation acquired the nielsen company  a commercial printer 
the corporation also purchased the remaining minority interests in its consolidated subsidiary  quality color press  inc in may and certain of its subsidiaries in central america in august on january   the corporation signed a definitive merger agreement with wallace computer services  inc wallace  a leading provider of printed products and print management services  to acquire all of the outstanding share of wallace in exchange for average consideration of in cash and shares of the corporation for each outstanding share of wallace 
the purchase price is approximately billion based on approximately million wallace shares outstanding  which includes the assumption of approximately million in debt  but does not include any direct transaction costs 
the estimated purchase price was derived using the closing trading price of the corporation s common shares on the new york stock exchange nyse at january   which approximates the average closing price of moore shares two trading days before and after january   the announcement date 
completion of the wallace merger is subject to customary closing conditions that include  among others  receipt of required approval from wallace shareholders  required regulatory approvals and closing of the required financing 
the transaction  while expected to close in the first half of  may not be completed if any of the closing conditions are not satisfied 
under certain terms specified in the merger agreement  the corporation or wallace may terminate the agreement  and as a result  either party may be required to pay a termination fee of up to million to the other party 
upon consummation  the transaction will be recorded by allocating the cost of the assets acquired  including intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net of amounts assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed will be recorded as goodwill 
unless otherwise indicated  the consolidated financial statements and related notes pertain to the corporation as a stand alone entity and do not reflect the impact of the pending business combination transaction with wallace 
during  the corporation undertook restructuring actions  mainly related to workforce reductions and the exiting of facilities 
the corporation s results for the periods discussed hereafter are affected by those restructuring actions 
in and  the corporation reduced headcount by approximately  employees 
in  the corporation also recorded charges for the impairment of assets and goodwill associated with non core businesses that the corporation planned to sell 
in the fourth quarter of  the corporation recorded a restructuring charge related to workforce reductions primarily due to a plant closure 
the corporation has also consolidated its vendors to improve pricing  payment terms and inventory management 
while the corporation does not anticipate additional significant reductions in the number of its suppliers  it will pursue additional opportunities to achieve cost savings with these suppliers 
the corporation has evaluated its capital expenditure and research and development requirements and has significantly reduced spending in these areas 
in addition  cost reductions were achieved in the area of information technology  principally attributable to reductions in headcount and in utilization of consultants 
additional cost savings are expected to result from the implementation of a company wide system for processing customer orders and payments 
the principal benefits from this system are expected to be improved control  reduction in cycle time and the elimination of the costs associated with maintaining redundant systems 
the corporation has also reduced waste ie  flawed or excess production and improved printing throughput ie  increased the speed at which equipment runs 
the following discussion includes information on a consolidated basis presented in accordance with canadian gaap 
this discussion is supplemented by a discussion of segment operating income before deductions for restructuring and other charges 
this supplemental discussion should be read in conjunction with the corporation s reported consolidated financial statements presented in item the corporation s results during the period discussed have also been affected by industry wide trends  mainly downward pricing pressure associated with the high degree of competition resulting in part from excess capacity in the industry and fragmentation in the printing market 
while the corporation believes that continued consolidation in the industry will result in greater pricing discipline within the industry and greater opportunities for cross selling  other trends may have a countervailing effect 
the eventual effect  for example  of electronic substitution on the printing industry cannot be predicted 
the corporation has not experienced any material adverse effect from electronic substitution 
the corporation continues to adapt its product line to the evolving demands of the digital products and services market 
the effect these actions will have on the corporation s results or financial condition cannot be predicted

recently issued accounting standards effective january   the corporation adopted various accounting standards as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  none of which had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
pending standards and their estimated effect on the corporation s consolidated financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the corporation s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
significant policies that the corporation believes involves the application of significant judgment as described by management include revenue recognition the corporation typically recognizes revenue for the majority of its products upon shipment to the customer and the transfer of title 
under agreements with certain customers  custom forms may be stored by the corporation for future delivery 
in these situations  the corporation receives a logistics and warehouse management fee for the services it provides 
in these cases  delivery and billing schedules are outlined with the customer and product revenue is recognized when manufacturing is complete  title transfers to the customer  the order is invoiced and there is reasonable assurance as to collectability 
since the majority of products are customized  product returns are not significant  however  the corporation accrues for the estimated amount of customer credits at the time of sale 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
long term product contract revenue is recognized based on the completed contract method or percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method is used only for product contracts that will take longer than three months to complete  and project stages are clearly defined and can be invoiced 
the contract must also contain enforceable rights by both parties 
revenue related to short term service contracts and contracts that do not meet the percentage of completion criteria is recognized when the contract is completed 
accounts receivable the corporation maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is reviewed at least quarterly for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for product and services 
additional allowances may be necessary in the future if the ability of its customers to pay deteriorates 
pension and postretirement plans the corporation records annual amounts relating to its pension and postretirement plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
the corporation reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the corporation believes that the assumptions utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience  market conditions and input from its actuaries 
the plan assumptions for both the united states and international qualified pension plans  which comprise approximately of the projected benefit obligation at december   are based on current estimated market rates to settle the remaining portion of the plan as both plans have been terminated 
the health care cost trend rates used in valuing the corporation postretirement benefit obligation are established based upon actual health care cost trends and consultation with our actuaries 
the following is the effect of a increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year on expressed in thousands of us dollars accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit cost the following is the effect of a decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates for each future year on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit cost in reaction to the significant increase in health care costs in recent years  the corporation increased this assumption at the november  valuation date 
the discount rate assumption is based upon published long term bond indices at each measurement date 
changes in the discount rate do not have a significant effect on the postretirement benefit cost due to the maturity of the plan participants 
income taxes the valuation allowance at december   relates to net operating losses generated in the united states  canada  latin america  and europe which have limited carry forward periods  and future deductible expenses 
the corporation has maintained a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets based on an evaluation of the amount of deferred tax assets that management believes are more likely than not to be ultimately realized in the foreseeable future 
the valuation allowance was reduced in based on management s best estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that will more likely than not be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure the risks inherent in the corporation s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is summarized as the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates  credit worthiness  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
there have been no material changes in market risk from the prior year 
interest rates and foreign currency the corporation is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings under its credit facilities 
interest rate swap agreements were entered into to hedge the corporation s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its term loan b facility 
these swap agreements exchange the variable interest rates libor on this facility for fixed interest rates over the terms of the agreements 
the corporation is also exposed to price risk in respect of its fixed rate financial instruments see note to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates 
the exposure to foreign currency movements is limited because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate 
to the extent revenues and expenses are not in the local currency of the operating unit  the corporation enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the currency risk 
as of december   the aggregate amount of outstanding forward contracts was million 
gains and losses from these foreign currency contracts were not significant at december  the corporation does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the corporation assessed market risk based on changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change in prevailing interest and foreign currency rates 
using this sensitivity analysis  the corporation determined such changes would not have a material effect on earnings  fair values and cash flows 
credit risk the corporation is exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable balances 
this risk is limited due to the corporation s large  diverse customer base  dispersed over various geographic regions and industrial sectors 
no single customer comprised more than of the corporation s consolidated net sales in  and the corporation maintains provisions for potential credit losses  and any such losses to date have been within the corporation s expectations 
commodities the primary raw materials used by the corporation are paper and ink 
the cost of paper and ink represents a significant portion of costs of sales 
increases in price or a lack of availability of supply of these raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the corporation uses its significant purchasing volume to negotiate long term supply contracts that give favorable prices  terms  quality and service 
while the corporation believes that these long term contracts will enable the corporation to receive adequate supplies of paper in the event of a tight paper supply  there can be no assurance in this regard 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the corporation has incorporated price adjustment clauses in certain sales contracts 
the corporation does not think it is practicable to measure the impact of a hypothetical change in the price of paper and other raw materials on its earnings and cash flows 
management believes such a change would not have a significant effect on the corporation since these costs are generally passed through to its customers
