item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of business meadowbrook insurance group  inc the company is a specialty risk management company specializing in alternative market insurance and risk management solutions for agents  brokers  professional and trade associations  and insureds of all sizes 
the alternative market includes a wide range of approaches to financing and managing risk exposures  such as captives  risk retention and risk purchasing groups  governmental pools and trusts  and self insurance plans 
the alternative market developed as a result of the historical volatility in the cost and availability of traditional commercial insurance coverages  and usually involves some form of self insurance or risk sharing on the part of the client 
the company develops and manages alternative risk management programs for defined client groups and their members 
the company also operates as an insurance agency representing policyholders in placing their insurance coverages with unaffiliated insurance companies 
management defines its business segments as specialty risk management operations and agency operations 
on june   the company sold  shares of newly issued common stock at per share in a public offering 
on june   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to acquire  of additional shares of the company s common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions  and expenses  the company received net proceeds from the offering of million 
the company utilized million of the million raised in its public offering to pay down its line of credit by million and to contribute million to the surplus of star 
specialty risk management operations the specialty risk management operations focus on specialty or niche insurance business in which the company provides services and coverages that are tailored to meet the specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
this includes providing services  such as risk management consulting  claims handling  loss control  and reinsurance brokering  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  general liability  and commercial multiple peril 
the company categorizes its programs into three categories managed  risk sharing  and fully insured 
in managed programs  the company usually assumes no insurance risk and generates fee revenue through program management services 
in risk sharing programs  the company participates with the client or producing agent in the operating results of the programs through a captive  rent a captive or similar insured vehicles  which are reinsurance companies and are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
in risk sharing programs  the company derives revenues from net earned premiums and investment income 
in addition  the company may benefit from any margin built into the ceding commissions for services it renders on behalf of the risk sharing partner for the program 
in fully insured programs  the company provides commercial insurance coverage and derives revenue exclusively from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are developed in response to a specific market opportunity and generally when the company believes there is potential to subsequently create a risk sharing program 
agency operations the agency segment was formed in as a retail insurance agency 
the agency operations have grown to be one of the largest agencies in michigan and  with acquisitions  have expanded into california 
the agency operations primarily produce commercial insurance  as well as personal property  casualty  life and accident and health insurance  with more than fifty insurance carriers from which it earns commission income

management s discussion and analysis continued in recent years  the company has derived its revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees investment income net realized gain on investments specialty risk management segment agency operations reconciling items gain loss on sale of subsidiary intersegment revenue consolidated revenue the revenue included in reconciling items relates to interest income in the holding company 
significant accounting policies and risk factors losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid loss and loss expenses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and loss expenses 
as of december   the company had accrued million of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves compared with million at december  reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid loss and loss adjustment expenses lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
while management believes that the amount accrued is collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
when a claim is reported to one of the insurance company subsidiaries  its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the claims 
in accordance with industry practice  the company maintains  in addition to case reserves  estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses incurred but not yet reported 
the company projects an estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and loss expense reserves and ii case loss reserves and loss expense reserves thereon is carried as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  the company estimates the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reserves are reviewed by both internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a periodic basis 
when reviewing reserves  the company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is not a precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in management s selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and discontinued programs during the three years ended december    and  the company took actions to eliminate a limited group of unprofitable programs that were not aligned with its alternative risk management strategy 
the company also established strict corporate program guidelines that identify the following criteria as unacceptable risk taking in the surety line of business  programs with aggregate stop loss provisions  where the client s risk sharing is capped at a specified loss ratio  and programs which lack adequate capital contributed by the risk sharing partner or proven profitable experience 
the underwriting losses associated with these programs were million  million  and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
all premiums related to these programs were fully earned during the first half of in addition  at december   the uncertainty of future reserve development on these discontinued programs appears to have been reduced as a result of aggressive claims handling and reserve strengthening 
however  there can be no certainty that there will not be additional losses in the future associated with these programs 
credit risk in its risk sharing programs  the company is also subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by its clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  and on the portion of risk exposure either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors considered by the company in entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
the company collateralizes balances due from its risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
at december   the company had risk exposure in excess of collateral in the amount of million  compared to million at december   on these programs  for which the company has an allowance of million  compared to million at december   related to these exposures 
the company has historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners 
at the end of each quarter an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
management believes that this allowance is adequate 
to date  the company has 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from its risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of the company s risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
taxes at december   the company had a deferred tax asset of million  million of which is related to a net operating loss carryforward nol 
realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income to absorb both the applicable reversing temporary differences and the nol 
at december   management concluded that the positive evidence supporting the generation of future taxable income sufficient to realize the deferred tax asset outweighed the negative evidence of the cumulative losses reported for the periods ended december    and this conclusion was based upon the current market conditions that supported the cumulative premium rate increases of since the beginning of is expected to continue  the accident year loss and lae ratio was on the company s continuing business  and there was little adverse development on and prior reserves related to continuing business as of december   the completion of the company s exit of certain discontinued unprofitable programs 
exposures related to these programs were fully earned during the first half of furthermore  the uncertainty of future reserve development appears to have been reduced by aggressive claims handling which reduced the number of pending claims  reserve strengthening incurred in  and a claim by claim review conducted by the company s corporate claims department during the fourth quarter of  and alternative tax strategies  which could generate capital gains from the potential sale of assets and or subsidiaries 
goodwill effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
 for periods starting december  or thereafter  eliminates the amortization of goodwill 
in addition  the company is required to test  at least annually  all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
also pursuant to sfas no 
 the company is required to test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in  the company is no longer amortizing goodwill 
the company evaluates existing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company carries goodwill on two reporting units within the agency operations segment in the amount of million and three reporting units within the specialty risk management operations segment in the amount of million 
the operating results for the reporting units that carry goodwill have historically generated profits and were not impacted by the unprofitable programs that were previously discontinued 
management evaluated the net carrying value of goodwill to determine if there has been any impairment of value 
the methodology used for this evaluation included the review of current market values of the reporting units and annual operating performance 
based on this evaluation  management determined there is no impairment to goodwill 
at december  and  the net goodwill was million 
amortization expense in relation to goodwill in and was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 there was no amortization expense recorded in relation to goodwill in

investments classified as available for sale securities are available to be sold in the future in response to the company s liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes 
other than temporary impairments of securities and unrealized losses on investments the company s policy on other than temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of the following factors market value consistently equal to or less than of amortized cost for a six month period  rating downgrade or other credit event  eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in market value

table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in  compared to of net earned premium in also contributing to the improvement was the impact of rate increases achieved in and of and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company reported net adverse development on loss and lae of million  or of net loss and lae reserves 
the adverse development reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of the company s reserves during the major components of this development are as follows continuing programs the continuing programs contributed net favorable development of  on reserves of million related to accident years and prior 
this favorable development reflects better than expected claims activity on both workers compensation programs and liability occurrence programs that contributed million  and  respectively to the net favorable development 
as a result of reducing the number of outside third party administrators and by bringing the claims handling in house  the company was able to reduce reserves for claims handling by million 
these favorable results were partially offset by million of adverse development in automobile liability   in general liability  million in claims made coverage for medical malpractice  and  in property exposures 
the adverse development in these lines of business was the result of a higher level of actual claims activity than had been previously anticipated 
discontinued and terminated programs the programs that were discontinued that had aggregate stop loss provisions  lack of risk sharing or proven actuarial experience  and the surety line of business accounted for million of the adverse development on reserves of million related to accident years and prior 
this adverse development reflected higher than expected claims reported and paid in automobile liability of million  million in liability occurrence programs  and  in workers compensation 
the programs that were terminated in late and in to reduce leverage ratios accounted for million of the adverse development on reserves of million related to accident years and prior 
this adverse development primarily reflects higher than expected claims reported and paid in automobile liability of million  million in general liability  and million in claims made liability 
this adverse development was partially offset by favorable development on workers compensation programs of  this increase in incurred losses on both discontinued and terminated programs reflects a higher level of reported and paid claims  as well as an increase in underlying case reserves on discontinued business 
management believes the increase in incurred losses  which includes both case and paid losses  is the result of recent changes in claims management on these programs that includes claim audits  centralization of claims handling  and the aggressive closing of claim files 
these actions caused changes in payment and development patterns which no longer follow the company s historical or industry development patterns 
traditional actuarial methods may be causing these actions to be viewed as an indication of a need for higher expected ultimate loss selections  rather than stronger underlying case reserves or acceleration in the payment and reported incurred patterns 
at december   the company recorded management s best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  which was million 
reserves are reviewed by both internal and independent actuaries for adequacy on a periodic basis 
when reviewing reserves  the company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is not a precise method  however  for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
since  the company s calendar year development on prior reserves ranged from favorable development of in to adverse development of in adverse development during years ended december  through december  averaged 
this unusually high level of adverse development reflects the impact of isolated deviations in the company s business model 
the deviations included programs that lacked historical loss experience and or risk sharing and resulted in significant changes in the expected loss ratios as the actual claims emerged 
furthermore  the use of aggregate stop loss provisions  which also deviated from the company s business model  had an impact on reserve development 
in a program with an aggregate stop loss provision the initial expected loss ratio used in program development and the establishment of premium rates assumed that the projected experience of the program would be below the aggregate attachment point 
since the independent producer of the business was compensated as a percentage of premium and had limited financial risk for underwriting results  these programs experienced rapid growth without meeting the company s historical underwriting guidelines 
the initial reserves were established based upon these initial expected loss ratios 
as claims started to be reported  it became apparent that the expected loss ratios were too low and reserves were adjusted accordingly 
as frequency of losses continued to outpace expectations and the aggregate attachment points were exceeded  additional reserve strengthening became necessary 
as previously discussed  the company took actions to discontinue these programs starting in late  and the premiums relating to these programs were fully earned during the first half of furthermore  at december   the uncertainty of future reserve development has been reduced as a result of aggressive claims handling and reserve strengthening 
as previously discussed  during  the company s continuing programs contributed favorable development of  or of reserves related to those programs 
however  there can be no certainty that there will not be additional losses in the future associated with these programs 
the key assumptions used in management s selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and the company s expense ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the comparable period in due to the run off of discontinued and terminated programs  gross premium is declining and  as a result  fixed costs as a percentage of revenue have temporarily increased the expense ratio

these increases were partially offset by the impact of the purchase of a large quota share reinsurance treaty for several workers compensation programs and the decline in written premium from discontinued programs 
management fees grew  or  to million from million

the revised agreement includes a million term loan and a revolving line of credit for up to million 
the term loan calls for quarterly amortization of the principal beginning on october  until july   at which time the term loan will be paid in full 
the quarterly amortization requires payments of million on october  and january   million on april  and july   million on october   and million for the remaining quarterly amortization payments in   and  with a final payment of million on july  the revolving line of credit will expire on july   and is thereafter renewable on an annual basis 
at december   the company had an outstanding balance of million and million on the term loan and revolving line of credit  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement  the company made a principal payment of million on october  subsequent to december   the company paid in full the amount outstanding on the revolving line of credit 
in addition  the company paid the million principal payment due on january   pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement 
both the term loan and revolving line of credit provide for interest at a variable rate based  at the company s option  upon either the prime rate or eurocurrency rate 
the applicable margin  which ranges from to basis points above eurocurrency rates  is determined by the level of the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the most restrictive covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the fixed coverage ratio  as defined by the credit facility  is the ratio of the non regulated earnings before interest and taxes for the four preceding fiscal quarters to the sum of fixed charges which include interest expense  principal payments payable  stock repurchases  and dividends declared during the period 
any unused portion of the revolving credit as of the date of determination reduces the sum of these fixed charges

as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries 
the company did not receive any dividends from its regulated insurance subsidiaries in a significant portion of the company s consolidated assets represent assets of the insurance company subsidiaries that at this time cannot be transferred to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from its insurance company subsidiaries is dictated by michigan insurance regulatory guidelines  which are as follows the maximum discretionary dividend that may be declared  based on data from the preceding calendar year  is the greater of each insurance company s net income excluding realized capital gains or ten percent of the insurance company s surplus excluding unrealized gains 
these dividends are further limited by a clause in the michigan law that prohibits an insurer from declaring dividends except out of surplus earnings of the company 
earned surplus balances are calculated on a quarterly basis 
since star is the parent insurance company  its maximum dividend calculation represents the combined insurance companies surplus 
based upon the statutory financial statements  star may only pay dividends to the company during with the prior approval of michigan office of financial and insurance services ofis 
star s earned surplus position at december  was negative million 
no dividends were paid in or the insurance company subsidiaries are required to maintain certain deposits with regulatory authorities  which totaled million at december   and million at december  regulatory and rating issues insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
the company s targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as previously indicated  the company contributed million to the surplus of star during the second quarter of the premium leverage ratios as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  were to and to on a gross and net written premium basis  respectively 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general under these laws  an insurance company must submit a report of its rbc level to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidating proceeding 
the rbc model act provides for four different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the company s total adjusted capital  defined as the total of its statutory capital  surplus and asset valuation reserve  to its risk based capital 
the company action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the company action level  a company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority that discusses proposed corrective actions to improve its capital position 
a company whose total adjusted capital is between and of its risk based capital is subject to a trend test 
a trend test calculates the greater of any decrease in the margin ie the amount in dollars by which a company s adjusted capital exceeds it risk based capital between the current year and the prior year and between the current year and the average of the past three years  and assumes that the decrease could occur again in the coming year 
if a similar decrease in margin in the coming year would result in a risk based capital ratio of less than  then company action level regulatory action would be triggered 
the regulatory action level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital 
at the regulatory action level  the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying corrective actions that must be followed 
the authorized control level is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than but greater than or equal to of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary  including placing the company under regulatory control 
the mandatory control level  is triggered if a company s total adjusted capital is less than of its risk based capital  at which level the regulatory authority is mandated to place the company under its control

the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies twelve industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners

the improvement in the ratio was a result of rate increases obtained and the run off of unprofitable discontinued programs

on june   am best upgraded the insurance company subsidiaries financial strength rating to a b very good with a positive outlook 
a positive outlook is placed on a company s rating if its financial and market trends are favorable  relative to its current rating level 
the upgrade reflects am best s positive assessment of the company s improved financial condition as a result of the issuance of new common shares and its debt reduction 
however  there can be no assurance that am best will not change its rating of the insurance company subsidiaries in the future 
reinsurance considerations the company seeks to manage the risk exposure of its insurance subsidiaries and its clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
the company s reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
the company secures this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  the company is subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of its reinsurers 
in its selection of reinsurers  the company evaluates the financial stability of its prospective reinsurers 
to date  the company has not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting reinsurance recoverables other than those balances related to csc and hih  as discussed previously  and for which allowances have been established 
no assurance can be given regarding the future ability of any of the company s reinsurers to meet their obligations

the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors considered by the company in entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
the company collateralizes balances due from its risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or letters of credit 
at december   the company had 
table of contents meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued risk exposure in excess of collateral in the amount of million on these programs  of which the company has an allowance of million related to these exposures 
the company has historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
management believes this allowance is adequate 
to date  the company has not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from its risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of any of the company s risk sharing partners to meet their obligations

under the prospective method  stock based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the change is made 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based compensation expense related to new and unvested awards in the year of change equal to that which would have been recognized had sfas no 
been adopted as of its effective date  fiscal years beginning after december  the retrospective restatement method recognizes stock compensation costs for the year of change and restates financial statements for all prior periods presented as though the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

management s discussion and analysis continued item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of asset and liability management where the target duration of the investment portfolio is managed to approximate that of the liabilities as determined by actuarial analysis 
at december   the fair value of the company s investment portfolio was million  of which is invested in debt securities 
the remaining is invested in preferred stocks 
the company s market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company s investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
during the year  the company continued to increase its allocation to taxable securities to maximize after tax income and the utilization of the company s nol 
for the company s investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  the company does not anticipate significant changes in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in its sensitivity model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
based upon this sensitivity model  a basis point increase in interest rates produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately million 
this loss in fair value only reflects the impact of interest rate increases on the fair value of the company s debt securities 
this loss after tax constitutes of shareholders equity 
the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material loss in fair values
