during our overall revenues decreased by  but this decrease was more than fully offset by a decrease in our overall costs and expenses 
approximately of the overall decrease was attributable to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas which ceased the amortization of goodwill and defined the rules for recording impairment of goodwill  effective january  the remaining reduction in our operating expenses was largely the result of our restructuring activities  as more fully described in note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
our financial position remains strong 
during we generated net cash from operating activities of million and had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments at year end

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principals require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  restructuring  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
see also future operating results financial accounting related matters  below 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fees revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement is in force  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements such as license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided i the above criteria are met  ii payment of the license fees are not dependent upon the performance of the services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of license fees is dependent on performance of services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours completed 
as a result  recognized revenues and profits are subject to revisions as the contract phases are actually completed 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees revenue for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment to the end user or direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when the fee is actually collected 
technical support revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts and for education are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from other contract services are generally recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting described above 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
prior to  these assets were generally recorded at amortized cost 
the carrying values of these intangible assets were reviewed on a periodic basis  under the accounting rules then in effect  and our testing indicated no impairment of the assets carrying value 
beginning in  new accounting rules issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb provided that goodwill could no longer be amortized  and had to be tested for impairment at least annually 
these rules further changed the method of evaluating goodwill from a recoverability test based upon undiscounted cash flows to a fair value approach 
the application of these new rules resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million in the first quarter of and a goodwill impairment of million in the fourth quarter of see note one to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and other purchased intangibles  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
as of december   we had recorded million of goodwill 
the review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates to determine both the fair values and the carrying values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments see note ten to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other intangible assets including in process research and development  and developed technology 
changes in our internal business structure  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future goodwill impairment 
we continue to review our other intangible assets purchased technology and customer lists for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
additional allowances might be required if deteriorating economic conditions affect our customers ability to make timely payments 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
subjective judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon the general release 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of the product  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future costs of completing and disposing of certain products 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
restructuring during and  we recorded significant accruals in connection with various restructuring activities 
these accruals included estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations  based on the analysis of independent real estate consultants 
during we recorded an additional restructuring charge relating to these lease obligations of million due to deteriorating market conditions associated with certain properties originally identified as part of our restructuring plan 
see note thirteen to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from the estimates 
if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees or if rental rates continue to decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or it takes us longer then expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million  which included a valuation allowance of million 
see note eight to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if we determine during any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to increase income for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset to record a charge to income for the period 
subjective judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
contingencies and litigation we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other things 
when we reasonably determine that a liability has been or will be incurred  and can reasonably estimate the range of potential losses in these matters  then we are required to adequately provide for these loss contingencies 
even if we are not able to estimate the amount of potential loss in these matters  in the case of a potential material matter we are required to disclose the fact that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
our financial position or results of operation could be adversely affected if we have grossly underestimated the scope of potential liability and or the range of a potential loss in any matter 
results of operations revenues dollars in millions change change license fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues total revenues total revenues for decreased percent from total revenues in which had decreased percent from 
the decrease in is primarily due to a percent decline in license fees revenues as a result of a generally weak global economy  and a tenuous it market in which customers continued to delay infrastructure investments requiring significant dollars and resources 
the decrease in total revenues was also due to a percent decline in our professional services revenues and education revenues 
the declines in these areas were partially attributable to the economic factors discussed above  and partially due to our restructuring activities in and that significantly reduced our professional services headcount 
we reduced our professional services headcount in order to de emphasize building future capacity  and to focus instead on current profitable engagements 
these decreases were offset somewhat by a increase in technical support revenues resulting from an overall increase in our installed base 
our installed based increased  in part  when we acquired nen and its customer base in license fees revenues in decreased percent from license fees revenues which had decreased percent from 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decline in license revenues from enterprise database and mobile database products 
demand for these products continued to be affected by sluggish economic growth and a significant decrease in overall it spending  especially for larger enterprise systems 
we also experienced significantly less demand from the expansion of our existing customers internally deployed applications 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in license fees revenues of certain enterprise application products 
from a segment standpoint  enterprise database revenues were primarily reflected as part of esd revenues  mobile databases revenues were primarily reflected as part of ias revenues  and enterprise application revenues were primarily reflected as part of ebd revenues 
the decrease in was largely due to decreased sales of our enterprise database and enterprise application products 
this resulted from a significant slowdown in it spending  primarily triggered by the weakened economy 
services revenues derived from technical support  education and professional services declined percent in from which had increased percent from 
the decrease in was due to a percent decrease in education and professional services revenues as a result of the economic factors discussed above

european revenues declined percent in which had increased percent in primarily due to a percent decrease in license fees revenues and a percent decrease in education and professional services revenues  partially offset by a percent increase in technical support revenues

the decrease in intercontinental revenues was largely the result of the economic factors discussed under revenues  above 
in  intercontinental revenues increased percent due to a percent increase in license fees revenues  primarily associated with our enterprise application and mobile database products  and a combined increase of percent in services revenues 
in europe and the intercontinental region  most revenues and expenses are denominated in local currencies 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenues and expenses was not material in   or although we take into account changes in exchange rates over time in our pricing strategy  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the strength of local economies  and the general volatility of software markets may result in a higher or lower proportion of international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in the future

the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of services revenues in over primarily results from a larger percentage of service revenues being comprised of technical support revenues compared to revenues from consulting and education services 
our operating margin on technical support revenue is generally much higher than our operating margin on consulting and education revenue 
the decrease  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of services revenues in over  was primarily due to a reduction in consulting personnel resulting from our restructuring activities

amortization of goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas effective january  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
with the adoption of sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  see new accounting pronouncements  below  incorporated here by reference 
amortization of goodwill increased percent during compared to these costs were percent of total revenues in compared to percent in the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in compared to was primarily due to the amortization of goodwill arising from the nen acquisition 
amortization of other purchased intangibles in and  amortization of other purchased intangibles primarily reflects the amortization of the established customer list associated with the acquisition in of hfn now ffi 
the amortization of purchased technology associated with the hfn and nen acquisitions is contained in cost of license fees 
in  amortization of other purchased intangibles consists of the amortization of customer lists associated with the hfn acquisition and the amortization of certain covenants not to compete 
goodwill impairment after the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of  we are required to test goodwill annually or earlier if certain events or circumstances were present 
prior to the fourth quarter of  there were no indications of impairment for our reporting units with goodwill  as they substantially achieved their targeted results and there were no other prescribed events or circumstances indicating an impairment 
we conducted our annual impairment testing required by sfas as of december  using an independent third party appraiser to determine the fair value of our various reporting units 
the first step of this analysis required us to compare the fair values of our various reporting units to their carrying values 
in order to determine the carrying values of our identified reporting units  we assigned our assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and other intangible assets  between the various reporting units 
the fair values of our reporting units were determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset  measuring the current value of the asset by calculating the present value of its future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax deductions  and proceeds from disposition 
value indications are developed by discounting expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation  and risks associated with the particular investment 
based on this analysis we determined that there was a potential impairment of the goodwill associated with the ffi reporting unit 
in the second step of this analysis  we allocated ffi s fair value to its various assets and then compared the implied fair value of its goodwill to the goodwill s carrying value 
based on this comparison  we determined that the carrying value of ffi s goodwill exceeded its implied value by million 
this impairment loss was recognized during the quarter ended december  the fair value of the ffi reporting unit as of december   was lower than the fair value we had determined for this reporting unit in the first quarter of for purposes of the implementation of sfas primarily due to a reduction in our estimated compound growth rates for ffi s future revenues and expenses 
based on our analysis of market conditions and our expectations for long term growth within the ffi reporting unit as of december   we reduced the compound annual growth rates in revenues and expenses 
in process research and development nen in connection with our acquisition of nen in the quarter ended june   we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
these amounts were written off during the quarter ended june  in analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to acquire technology  including in process technology  rather than to develop it internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of internal expertise  time and cost it would take to bring the technology to market 
nen technologies enable e business and operational applications to share critical information 
nen s software solutions support integration of internet and core business packaged applications  application server platforms  industry standard protocols  and proprietary systems 
as of february  the acquisition date nen was undergoing development efforts to release the next version of e biz integrator  process server  adapters  and emerging products such as open business interchange sm 
these development efforts were all proprietary  internal projects 
at the acquisition date  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative future uses 
in assessing the qualification of nen s various ongoing research and development projects  each project was examined to determine whether technological feasibility had been established as of the acquisition date 
our assessment was based on extensive interviews and a detailed analysis of research and development plans 
if a project required additional planning  designing  coding or testing activities to determine whether the associated product could be produced to meet its design specifications  we determined that technological feasibility had not been achieved 
due to the complexity and specialized features of the acquired research and development  the technologies under development could only be used for specific and intended purposes in the e business integration industry and no alternative value could be realized if these projects failed in that context 
accordingly  the value allocated to projects that had not achieved technological feasibility as of the acquisition date was immediately expensed 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the in process research and development using risk adjusted discount rates 
the selection of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted to reflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances known at the time  and each technologies degree of completion 
projected future net cash flow attributable to nen s in process research and development  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using a discount rate of percent 
we believe our estimated in process research and development amount represented fair value and does not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates in this context were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
this analysis included the revenues projected to result from the expected evolution of the technology over time 
operating expenses used in our analysis included selling  general and administrative and research and development 
these expenses were based on an overall analysis of the business enterprise 
total research and development was divided into the costs to complete the in process research and development projects and costs for developed products that had already been introduced to the market 
the allocation was based on an analysis of resources relating to the development of research and development 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by management  and allocated based on anticipated completion efforts and expected completion dates 
costs to complete were further allocated between in process and future revenues based on an analysis of how the technologies would evolve 
nen expected to achieve a target margin of approximately percent from its in process products 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first years of the products lifecycle due to anticipated higher levels of sales and marketing expense in the earlier years as a percentage of revenue 
the financial forecasts included only results that were expected to be generated by nen on a standalone basis  and did not take into consideration synergies resulting from our acquisition 
to properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been accomplished as of the acquisition date  and to exclude the completion of development efforts underway  it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated with the research and development projects to reflect only those accomplishments completed as of the acquisition date 
the relative contribution made by the completed research and development efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including absolute development time  costs incurred to date  management estimates  a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks required to complete the efforts  and the associated risks 
nen s in process research and development projects were estimated to be between percent and percent complete as of the acquisition date depending on the project 
development of the majority of the in process technologies began in early and was substantially completed in the fall of at the acquisition date  approximately engineers were engaged in the development of nen s in process technologies 
completion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development  as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn the technologies into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
hfn in connection with the acquisition of hfn now ffi in  we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development 
as part of the process of analyzing this acquisition  the decision was made to buy technology that had not yet been commercialized rather than to develop the technology internally 
this decision was based on factors such as the amount of time and costs it would take to bring the technology to market 
hfn had been involved in the development of technologies that enable financial institutions to deliver their services to customers via the internet 
on the date we acquired hfn january   hfn was conducting development and qualification activities related to a suite of products encompassing bill presentment  small business functions  alternate service delivery methods and related underlying software technology 
at that time  the in process research and development projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the value allocated to these projects was immediately expensed at the date of acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of in process research and development using an income approach 
this involved estimating the fair value of the in process research and development by determining the present value of the estimated after tax cash flows expected to be generated by the purchased in process research and development  using risk adjusted discount rates 
the selection of the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital  adjusted to reflect risks associated with the useful life of each technology  profitability levels of each technology  the uncertainty of technology advances known at the time  and each technologies degree of completion 
projected future net cash flows attributable to hfn s in process research and development  assuming successful development  were discounted to net present value using a discount rate of percent 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amount so determined represents fair value and does not exceed the amount another third party would pay for the projects 
revenue estimates were based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
the analysis of the in process technology was determined by incorporating the revenue related to the expected evolution of the technology over time 
once developed  the estimated lifecycle of the product suite was estimated to be approximately to years 
as a whole  hfn was expected to exhibit compound annual growth of approximately percent in the period from through it was projected that the suite of products resulting from the in process research and development efforts would begin generating revenue in and positive cash flow in operating expenses included selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses 
total research and development was divided into i the costs to complete the in process research and development projects and ii costs for developed products that had already been introduced to the market  including product technical support 
costs to complete in process projects were estimated by management 
these costs were allocated based on an analysis of expected project completion dates 
the resultant target margin that hfn expected to achieve from the in process products was approximately percent 
profitability was expected to be significantly lower in the first several years of the product suite s lifecycle compared to the latter years due to a higher level of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue in the earlier years 
the financial forecasts only included results we expected hfn to generate on a standalone basis  and did not take into consideration synergies resulting from our acquisition 
to properly analyze the research and development efforts that had been accomplished to date and exclude the effort to be completed on the development efforts underway  it was necessary to adjust the overall forecasts associated with the research and development projects to reflect only the accomplishments made as of the date of the acquisition towards the ultimate completion of the in process r d projects 
the relative contribution made on the research and development efforts was assessed based on a variety of factors including absolute development time costs incurred to date  management estimates  and a detailed analysis of each of the primary tasks completed compared to the tasks required to complete the efforts and the associated risks 
overall  hfn s in process research and development projects were estimated to be approximately percent complete 
hfn estimated that the projects would be completed in march  after which time it expected to begin generating economic benefits from the completed projects 
as of the valuation date  approximately man months totaling  had been expended on the in process research and development projects 
in total  costs to complete hfn s in process research and development were expected to be approximately  and require man months of work 
completion of these projects was expected to require significant efforts involving continued software development as well as the testing and re qualification efforts required to turn a new to the world software suite into a set of bug free  commercial ready products 
these remaining tasks involved substantial risk due to the complex nature of the activities involved 
historically  many of hfn s in process research and development projects have required rework and additional expenditures in comparable stages of development 
stock compensation expense stock compensation expense reflects non cash compensation expense associated with restricted stock granted to certain individuals in the second quarter of  and the amortization of the value assigned to certain unvested stock options assumed in the acquisition of nen 
cost reversal of restructuring restructuring activities entering  we expected our revenues to increase during the second half of the year as the us economy shook off recessionary conditions and customers resumed their investment in enterprise software projects 
as we completed our second quarter  however  it became apparent that general economic conditions were not improving as anticipated  and that our revenues therefore were likely to lag below expectations 
faced with this realization  we embarked on certain restructuring activities during the third and fourth quarters the plan aimed at reducing our annual payroll and facilities related expenses by approximately million 
these activities included the termination of approximately employees worldwide  the closure or consolidation of approximately facilities worldwide  and the planned liquidation of approximately foreign subsidiaries 
the amounts included in the plan were as follows cash dollars in millions non cash q q total termination payments to employees and other related costs cash lease cancellations and commitments cash other non cash charges non cash other cash charges cash as of december   all affected employees had been notified of their termination benefits and severance compensation of million had been paid to approximately of these employees 
substantially all remaining severance payments are expected to be made by the second quarter of during the year ended december   a total of million in lease cancellations and other related expenses was paid in connection with facilities identified for consolidation or closure as part of the plan 
our payments toward the accruals relating to lease cancellations and commitments are dependent upon market conditions and our ability to negotiate acceptable lease buy outs or locate suitable subtenants 
these payments will be made over a period not to exceed years 
restructuring activities in connection with our acquisition of nen and after announcement that first quarter and revenues would be below expectations  we began to implement a restructuring plan designed to eliminate certain personnel  assets and facilities  and align our cost structure with anticipated revenues plan 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during to reflect these activities 
the plan called for the termination of approximately employees worldwide  as well as the consolidation or closure of approximately facilities worldwide and the write off of certain assets abandoned as a result of the office closures 
additionally  based on deterioration of real estate market conditions  our inability to sublease certain properties previously included in the plan resulted in additional restructuring accruals of million in the fourth quarter of that were established for properties located in colorado  michigan and the united kingdom 
the amounts included in the plan were as follows cash dollars in millions non cash total termination payments to employees and other related costs cash lease cancellations and commitments cash write downs of property  equipment and improvements non cash other cash as of december   all employees affected by the plan had been terminated and million in related severance payments and costs had been paid as of that date 
during  we reversed million of the termination payment accrual and made a corresponding credit to restructuring expense primarily due to a labor tribunal ruling that we were required to pay less in severance benefits that originally anticipated to certain non us employees 
as of december   we had paid a total of million relating to properties identified as part of the plan 
during  we reversed million of the restructuring accrual relating to lease cancellations and made a corresponding credit to restructuring expense primarily because we were required to pay less than expected to terminate our lease obligations on facilities in switzerland the remaining payments relating to lease cancellations and commitments  which will be made over a period not to exceed years  are dependent upon market conditions and our ability to negotiate acceptable lease buy outs or locate suitable sublease tenants 
operating income loss dollars in millions change change operating income loss percentage of total revenues not meaningful operating income in was million compared to an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in operating income in includes million in restructuring charges  while operating loss in includes million in restructuring charges 
in  operating income included a reversal to restructuring charges of million 
in  the increase in operating income was primarily due to a million decrease in operating expenses resulting principally from the effects of our restructuring activities in and  and the elimination of goodwill amortization upon the adoption of sfas this increase was partially offset by a decline in total revenues of million in from in  the decrease in operating income was primarily due to decreased license fees revenues an the increase in certain operating expenses 
these included expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles  the million write off of in process research and development relating to the acquisition of nen and our restructuring charges 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in services revenues 
other income expense  net dollars in millions change change interest income percentage of total revenues interest expense and other  net percentage of total revenues minority interest percentage of total revenues not meaningful in  interest income decreased percent from which had decreased percent from 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our investments 
the decrease in interest income from to  and from to is largely due to the decline in interest rate yields on the cash balances invested 
interest expense and other  net was million in  million in  and million in interest expense and other  net  includes gains from the disposition of certain real estate and investments  net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions and the related hedging activities  the cost of hedging foreign currency exposures  interest expense from capital lease obligations incurred in prior years  and bank fees 
in  the increase in interest expense and other  net as compared to was primarily due to a gain of approximately million that we realized on the sale of certain nen swiss subsidiaries that were primarily engaged in providing sap consulting services 
the increase in interest expense and other  net during compared to was primarily realized from gains on hedging activities that mitigated the losses resulting from certain foreign currency transactions 
provision for income taxes dollars in millions change change provision for income taxes in  we recorded a provision for taxes equal to approximately percent on pre tax income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal rate of percent primarily due to non deductible charges associated with the impairment loss on certain goodwill and the impact of state taxes 
in  we recorded a million provision for taxes on pre tax income of million resulting largely from taxes on earnings generated in certain international jurisdictions 
in  we had significant pre tax earnings in foreign jurisdictions and a significant pre tax loss in the us the us pre tax book loss primarily resulted from the non deductible amortization or write off of intangibles acquired in various acquisitions and our restructuring activities 
the significant amount of the expenses not deductible for tax purposes  primarily the amortization or write off of intangibles acquired in the nen acquisition  made our effective tax rate meaningless in in  taxes were recorded at a rate of percent on pre tax income 
the effective rate was below the statutory rate primarily due to a reversal of valuation allowances  and the benefit of certain earnings from operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world for which no us taxes were provided because such earnings were to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us these benefits were partially offset by non deductible charges for the amortization of goodwill and in process research and development primarily associated with our acquisition of hfn 
the reversal of million in a previously recorded valuation allowance was related to the deferred tax asset associated with certain research and development tax credits that we believe will generate a tax benefit in future periods given their carryforward periods 
the reversal of the valuation allowance was a non recurring benefit  and will not impact our provision for income taxes in future years 
we had a net deferred tax asset of million at december   which included a valuation allowance of million 
as of december   the gross deferred tax asset included research and development tax credits of million  foreign tax credits of million and an asset for certain net operating losses of million 
the research and development tax credits expire in years from through  the foreign tax credits expire in years from through and the net operating losses expire in years from and in order to realize our net deferred tax assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from the reversal of temporary differences ie  between book basis and tax basis  and from tax credit carryforwards 
specifically  realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income largely in the us we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
any such adjustments to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such adjustment is made 
the valuation allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses and foreign tax credits 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses acquired in the nen acquisition 
if the associated deferred tax assets are realized  the associated benefit will reduce goodwill arising from the nen acquisition  rather than future income tax expense 
our overall valuation allowance decreased by million in primarily due to our utilization of certain net operating losses acquired in the acquisition of nen and hfn  and the utilization of certain foreign tax credits 
cumulative effect of an accounting change to adopt sfas dollars in millions change change cumulative effect of an accounting change to adopt sfas not meaningful in accordance with sfas  we performed the required two step impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  using an independent third party appraiser 
in performing the first step of the analysis  we first assigned our assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and other intangible assets  to our identified reporting units to determine their carrying value 
for this purpose  the reporting units were determined to be our five business segments described in note ten to the consolidated financial statements  part ii  item the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was then determined utilizing the income approach 
upon comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value  we determined that goodwill attributable to the ffi and ebd reporting units was impaired 
the second step of comparing the implied fair values of the reporting units goodwill to their respective carrying values  we recognized an impairment loss of million in the first quarter of of this impairment loss  million related to ffi and million related to ebd 
these losses were recognized as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the impairment loss had no income tax effect 
our calculation of the fair value of ebd assumed compound annual growth rates in revenues and expenses of approximately percent and percent  respectively  as determined by management and an analysis of our industry s long term growth expectations 
our calculation of the fair value of ffi assumed compound annual growth rates in revenues and expenses of approximately percent and percent  respectively 
for both calculations  a discount rate of percent was utilized 
in future periods  a reduction of our estimated fair values associated with certain reporting units could result in a further impairment loss associated with various intangible assets 
as required by sfas  intangible assets that did not meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill were reclassified 
we transferred million of net assembled workforce to goodwill as of january  this amount was partially offset by the reclassification of million for an associated deferred tax liability

net cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from lower operating expenses incurred in due to the effects of the and restructuring activities  the timing of payments made against other accrued liabilities largely attributable to restructuring charges  and  an increase in deferred revenue 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities between and is primarily due to a decrease in net income  deferred revenue and accrued liabilities partially offset a reduction in accounts receivable and an increase in non cash expenses relating to amortization  depreciation and the write off of in process research and development 
net cash used for investing activities increased percent between and the increase in net cash used for investing activities was primarily due to million of cash investment net purchases during compared to net dispositions of cash investments of million in in addition  there was net cash gained from business combinations  primarily from the nen acquisition  of approximately million during  compared to million net cash used for acquisitions during net cash used for investing activities decreased percent between and the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to net cash gained from the nen acquisition  compared to net cash used in business combinations  primarily in connection with the hfn acquisition  for the same period in beginning in  the board of directors authorized sybase to repurchase its outstanding common stock in open market and other transactions from time to time  subject to price and other conditions stock repurchase program 
through december  aggregate amounts authorized under the stock repurchase program totaled million 
under this program  we repurchased million of our shares in at a cost if million  million shares in at a cost of million  and million shares in at a cost of million 
net cash used for financing activities decreased percent between and the decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily the result of a decrease in the cash used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program during  compared to the cash used for a similar purpose during net cash used for financing activities increased percent between and the increases in cash used for financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in the cash used to repurchase our common stock during  compared to the cash used for a similar purpose during we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december  we expect to fund expenditures for future capital requirements  liquidity and strategic operating programs from a combination of available cash balances and internally generated funds 
we have no outside debt  and do not have any plans to enter into borrowing arrangements 
we engage in global business operations and are therefore exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
as of december   we had identifiable assets totaling million associated with our european operations and million associated with our asia and latin american operations 
we experience foreign exchange transaction exposure on our net assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these assets are considered by sybase inc  the us parent company  to be a permanent investment in the respective subsidiaries  the related foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss under stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
we also experience foreign exchange translation exposure from certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity on whose books the balances reside 
we hedge certain of these short term exposures under a plan approved by the board of directors

sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
the disclosure provisions are required  however  for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method of accounting described in sfas or the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board apb opinion no

fin requires that the company recognize the fair value for guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by the company after december   if these arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation 
in addition  the company must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications  as required under previously existing gaap principles in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if the company determines it is probable that a loss has occurred then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications

under sfas a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
under prior guidance  a liability for such costs could be recognized at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that the liability be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  the adoption of this standard may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial condition or operating results

financial risk management foreign exchange risk as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
historically  our primary exposures have related to non us dollar denominated sales and expenses in europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
specifically  we enter into foreign currency contracts with a maturity of approximately days to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure created by certain balances that are denominated in a currency other than the principal reporting currency of the entity recording the transaction 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts are meant to mitigate the gains and losses on these outstanding foreign currency transactions 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in interest expense and other  net 
the unrealized gain loss on the outstanding forward contracts as of december  was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the tables below provide information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of december  and all of the outstanding forward contracts had maturities of approximately days 
the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was not material as of december  and amounts in thousands except exchange rates us notional average forward contracts as of december  amount contract rate contracts for the sale of us dollars and purchase of canadian dollars euro singapore dollars contracts for purchase of us dollars and sale of swiss franc brazilian real contracts for purchase of euros and sale of swedish krona swiss franc uk pound norwegian krone total amounts in thousands except exchange rates us notional average forward contracts as of december  amount contract rate contracts for the sale of us dollars and purchase of canadian dollars swedish krona euro singapore dollars contracts for purchase of us dollars and sale of swiss franc contracts for purchase of euros and sale of swedish krona swiss franc uk pound norwegian krone total interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  which consists of taxable  short term money market instruments and debt securities with maturities between days and three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
future operating results our future operating results may vary substantially from period to period due to a variety of significant risks  some of which are discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k 
we strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risks contained in this report including those regarding forward looking statements described on page revenue related factors the post decline of the us and global economies  compounded by the threat of imminent war in the middle east  led to a significant overall decrease in it spending in  especially for larger enterprise systems 
these factors contributed to a significant decline in our total revenues in we will continue to pursue our business strategies  with an increased emphasis on creating successful strategic and global alliances with key partners such as sun microsystems  apple computer  bearingpoint consulting  inc and peoplesoft  inc 
to provide customers with optimal solutions based on our leading edge technology and our partners capabilities in specific markets 
however  if we are unable to achieve these goals  or if we are unable to maintain and provide desirable  innovative products and services to existing customers  our ability to maintain or grow revenue may be significantly impaired 
this  in turn  could adversely impact our results of operations  even if we continue to generate a profit and to maintain positive cash flows 
furthermore  complex revenue recognition rules for software companies directly affect our ability to measure revenue for any given accounting period 
such rules are subject to constant review and revision by various bodies tasked with the establishment of accounting standards 
therefore  modifications or new interpretations of existing accounting guidance governing revenue recognition in the software industry could have a material effect on our business 
for a general discussion of our current revenue recognition rules and other critical accounting policies  see critical accounting policies and estimates  above  and changing legal and accounting environment  below  incorporated here by reference 
in addition to the above factors  the timing and amount of our revenues are subject to a number of factors that make it difficult to accurately estimate revenues and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
in our experience  license fees revenues tend to decline between the fourth quarter of one year and the first quarter of the next year 
this has contributed to lower total revenues and earnings in the first quarter compared to the prior fourth quarter 
we currently anticipate that this seasonal pattern will continue 
since we operate with little or no backlog  quarterly revenues depend largely on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
historically  we have recorded approximately to of our quarterly revenues in the last month of each quarter  particularly during the final two weeks 
our customers include many large enterprises that make substantial investments in our products and services 
therefore  the inability to record one or more large orders from a customer at the very end of a quarter could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
our operating expenses are based on projected annual and quarterly revenue levels  and are generally incurred ratably throughout each quarter 
since our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  failure to realize projected revenues for a specified period could impact operating results  causing an operating loss for that period 
in north america  we currently ship most of our products from our dublin  california facility near the site of our corporate headquarters 
because we tend to record a high percentage of revenues during the last two weeks of each quarter  disruption of operations at that facility due to natural calamity or systems failure  for example could directly harm our ability to record revenues for such quarter 
this could  in turn  have an adverse impact on operating results 
changing legal and accounting environment during the past several years  various accounting guidance has been issued with respect to revenue recognition rules in the software industry 
however  much of this guidance addresses software revenue recognition primarily from a conceptual level  and is silent as to specific implementation requirements 
as a consequence  accounting firms and their clients have been required to make assumptions  in certain circumstances  regarding application of the rules to transactions not addressed by the existing rules 
we believe our current business arrangements and contract terms have been properly reported under the current rules 
however  if final interpretations of these rules necessitate a change in our current revenue recognition practices  our results of operations  financial condition and business could be materially and adversely affected 
for further discussion  see critical accounting policies and estimates  above 
in addition to the above  the us congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act of soa on july   largely in response to a recent rash of financial scandals involving public companies such as enron 
the soa provides for sweeping and unprecedented corporate reforms  focusing on public company financial reporting  corporate ethics  and oversight of the accounting profession  among other areas  and establishing harsher civil and criminal penalties for violation of us securities laws 
certain provisions of the soa became effective immediately  and others required the sec to enact rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of the act 
many of these new sec mandated rules and procedures including rules requiring personal certification of a company s sec reports by the company s chief executive officer and senior financial officers  accelerated filing of certain sec reports  and changes in the role and functions of a company s audit committee  became effective during the latter half of and in early  and many additional rules and regulations will be enacted in and beyond 
we believe our corporate practices and standards meet or exceed the current rules and regulations promulgated under the soa 
however  new or additional rules that influence significant adjustments to our business practices and procedures could result in increased administrative costs  lengthened sales cycles and other changes that could adversely affect our results of operations 
stock price volatility our ability to exceed  or our failure to achieve  expected operating results for any period could significantly impact our stock price 
inevitably  some investors will experience gains while others will experience losses depending on the timing of their investment 
the market for our stock and for technology stocks in general has been highly volatile  and the trading price of the company s common stock has fluctuated widely in recent years 
during the past two years  us stock prices in general have experienced a significant downturn  due  in part  to the collapse of dot 
com stocks  the continued weakening of the us and global economic conditions  acts of domestic and international terrorism  and the threat of imminent war in the middle east see also revenue related factors  above 
our stock price may continue to fluctuate in the future in response to these and various other factors  including our financial results  press and industry analyst reports  market acceptance of our products and pricing policies  activities of competitors  acquisitions of other businesses and technologies  and other events 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have categorically affected the market price for high technology companies  but which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
competition the it industry and the market for our products and services is fast paced and extremely competitive  and is marked by dynamic customer demands  short product life cycles  and the rapid emergence of the e business marketplace 
we have numerous competitors  including large companies such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation  and ibm corporation  and other smaller highly aggressive firms 
many of these companies may have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  and a larger installed customer base than sybase 
in addition  our competitors advertising and marketing efforts could adversely influence customer perception of our products and services  and harm our business and prospects as a result 
to remain competitive  we must be able to develop new products  enhance existing products and retain competitive pricing policies in a timely manner 
our failure to compete successfully with new or existing competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business  and on the market price of our stock 
product development increased widespread use of the internet and fast growing market demand for enterprise portals and mobile and embedded solutions may significantly alter how we do business in the future 
this could affect our ability to timely meet the demand for new or enhanced products and services at competitive prices  which could significantly impact our ability to generate future revenues 
we have released the sybase enterprise portal  an industry leading enterprise class portal product designed to enable organizations to provide personalized business interfaces to employees  customers  partners and suppliers 
with our acquisition of nen in april  we gained the ability to offer enterprise application integrators that integrate sybase enterprise portal with other applications 
sybase enterprise portal solutions are intended to enable successful e business strategies for organizations transacting business via the internet 
when we acquired onepage  inc in april  we gained technology designed to further enhance our sybase enterprise portal offering 
our recent acquisition of avantgo in allows us to significantly enhance our ias mobile and embedded products and solutions 
we believe our focus on enterprise portals  mobile and embedded solutions and services and our other strategies will enhance revenues and profitability 
however  if the market does not continue to develop as anticipated  or if our solutions and services do not successfully compete in the relevant markets  we may not realize expected revenues and profitability 
our future results may also be affected if our products cannot interoperate and perform well with software products of other companies 
certain leading applications currently are not interoperable with our products  and others may never be 
in addition  many of our principal products are designed for use with products offered by competitors 
in the future  vendors of non sybase products may become less willing to provide us with access to their products  technical information  and marketing and sales support  which could harm our business and prospects 
changes in sales model our sales model has evolved significantly during the past few years to keep pace with new and developing business environments  such as the world wide web  and changing customer demands in our targeted markets 
if we have misjudged demand for our products and services in our target markets  or if we are unable to coordinate our sales efforts in a focused and efficient way  this could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects 
in january  we realigned our direct sales force  product teams and professional services capabilities into four divisions 
this reorganization was intended to enhance overall revenues and profitability by providing increased focus on each of four key markets enterprise solutions  mobile and embedded computing  internet applications and business intelligence 
in january  the acquisition of hfn now financial fusion  inc  a majority owned subsidiary increased our focus on the financial services market 
in may  we announced the launch of ianywhere solutions  inc  a majority owned subsidiary formed to continue the business of the mec division in mobile and embedded e business products and services 
ebd was created in the second quarter of when we acquired nen  and consists of certain operations of nen along with certain products previously in the esd segment and certain products previously in the former internet applications division 
in january  we further reorganized our sales focus with the creation of the infrastructure platform group ipg  which will focus on increasing market presence and revenue through solution partners eg  isvs  vars and oems and delivery partners eg  sis  distributors and resellers 
our worldwide field organization will continue to focus on end user customers  and will continue to provide field support to promote growth of our business through partners 
further reorganization of our sales model could have a direct affect on our results of operations 
see revenue related factors  above 
international operations we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from our international operations  and we plan to continue expanding our business in international markets in the future 
in  revenues outside north america represented of our total revenues 
because of this  global political unrest  acts of terrorism and the current war in the middle east could have a material impact on our international revenues and operations 
see revenue related factors  above 
as a global concern  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for a discussion of risks associated with currency fluctuation  see financial risk management foreign exchange risk above  incorporated here by reference 
our revenues outside north america could also fluctuate due to the relative immaturity of some markets  rapid growth in other markets  and organizational changes we have made to accommodate these conditions 
for example  during  we centralized finance functions within specific geographic regions rather than maintaining them on a country by country basis  closed a subsidiary in the czech republic  and dissolved new era of networks  inc as well as several of its majority owned and wholly owned subsidiaries 
in february  we acquired our distributor in denmark and in september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of our distributor in mexico 
during and  we closed various subsidiaries including chile and peru 
several significant management and organizational changes occurred during the same periods  including the resignation or replacement of regional management in europe and asia 
other factors that could significantly impact aspects of our international operations include changes in political  regulatory  or economic conditions changes or limitations in trade protection laws changes in tax treaties or laws favorable to sybase natural disasters intellectual property our inability to obtain adequate copyright  patent or trade secret protection for our products in certain countries may have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
in addition  as the number of software products and associated patents increase  it is possible that software developers will become subject to more frequent infringement claims 
in the past  third parties have claimed that their patents or other proprietary rights were violated by sybase products 
it is possible that such claims will be asserted in the future 
in addition  to the extent we acquire other technologies  whether directly from third parties or through acquisitions of other companies  we face the possibility that such intellectual property will be found to infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others 
for example  a trademark infringement and dilution case filed in against nen  a wholly owned subsidiary  resulted in a multi million dollar judgment against nen and an injunction against nen s use of the trade name neon 
the action was settled in september for a lesser amount as well as certain other concessions 
regardless of whether these claims have merit  they can be time consuming and expensive to defend or settle  and can harm the company s business and reputation 
we do not believe our products infringe any third party patents or proprietary rights  but there is no guarantee that we can avoid claims or findings of infringement in the future 
changes in management  human resources in recent years  we have added to our executive management team 
for example  in january  thomas volk joined the company as executive vice president  infrastructure platform group  and in the second quarter of  michael bealmear joined the company as executive vice president  worldwide field operations 
richard moore  who was named president of ffi in august  joined the company in july as senior vice president and general manager of the v business group 
in october  billy ho  our senior vice president and general manager of ebd  replaced george f 
rick adam  former ceo of nen who had previously been appointed to the position when we acquired nen in april further changes involving executives and managers resulting from acquisitions  mergers and other events could increase the current rate of employee turnover  particularly in consulting  engineering and sales 
changes in our board membership could also affect the company s current strategic business plans 
additionally  our inability to hire and retain qualified technical  managerial  sales and other employees could affect our product development and sales efforts  other aspects of our operations  and our financial results 
competition for highly skilled personnel in the software industry is typically intense 
our financial and stock price performance relative to the companies with whom we compete for employees  and the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located  could also impact the degree of future employee turnover 
acquisitions and strategic relationships we regularly explore possible acquisitions and other strategic ventures to expand and enhance our business 
we have recently acquired or invested in a number of companies and formed certain strategic relationships  and will likely continue to do so in the future 
for example  in february we completed our acquisition of avantgo  inc  a leading provider of mobile enterprise software  and in april  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of onepage  inc  a leading provider of technology and applications for building the information components portlets of corporate  consumer and wireless portals 
during  we acquired nen  a developer of enterprise application integration software  as well as our distributor in denmark 
during  we acquired certain assets of our distributor in mexico  and the stock of home financial network  inc now ffi 
in  we acquired data warehouse network  a provider of industry specific business intelligence application 
we may not achieve the desired benefits of our acquisitions and investments 
for example  we may be unable to successfully assimilate an acquired company s management team  business infrastructure  company culture  or other important factors
