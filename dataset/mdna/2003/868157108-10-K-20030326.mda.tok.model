for additional industry segment financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts and self insurance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to long lived assets 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
in connection with fas no 
 the transitional goodwill impairment evaluation required us to perform an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we then estimated the fair value of each reporting unit and compared it to the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on this test  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount  and the second step of the impairment test was not required 
no impairment loss has been recognized as the result of the adoption of fas no 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance 
we self insure up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  protection and indemnity  general liability  property damage  and group medical 
with the recent tightening in the insurance markets  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns  health care costs and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate excess insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share  as compared to revenue of million and income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million or diluted earnings per share for the decrease in revenue and operating income is a result of reduced activity by our customers  resulting in lower utilization of the company s expanded asset base 
in  we significantly expanded our capacity to serve our customers by adding three large liftboats  expanding our rental tool inventory  and expanding and enhancing several of our operating facilities 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention group segment revenue for our well intervention group was million for the year ended december   lower than the same period in this segment s gross margin decreased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  demand and pricing decreased for almost all of our services as production related activity decreased significantly 
marine segment our marine revenue for the year ended december  decreased over the same period in to million 
the gross margin percentage decreased to from as utilization for most liftboat classes declined in to from in we added two foot class liftboats and one foot class liftboat to our fleet during although these larger liftboats earn higher average dayrates  the fleet s average dayrate remained relatively unchanged from rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the same period in  and the rental tools gross margin percentage increased to from in these increases resulted from our acquisition of a drill pipe and handling tool rental company near the end of the third quarter of and our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and other oilfield services segment other oilfield services revenue for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the same period in the gross margin increased slightly to million in the year ended december  from million in the same period in this segment generated higher revenue and gross margin primarily from the acquisition of an environmental services company in january depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase mostly resulted from our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and as of january   we ceased amortizing our goodwill  while approximately million of goodwill amortization expense was recorded in the year ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily the result of our and acquisitions 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million or diluted earnings per share  as compared to revenue of million and net income before extraordinary loss of million or diluted earnings per share for this increase is the result of an increased demand for our services and our acquisitions 
the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention group segment revenue for our well intervention group for was million  a increase over the segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in demand and pricing increased for almost all of our services as production related activity was significantly higher throughout most of in addition to internal growth  our revenue and margin increases can be attributed to acquisitions made in and  which expanded our service offering to include hydraulic drilling and workover services and well control services  as well as a significant expansion of our coiled tubing services 
marine segment revenue for our marine segment for was million  an increase of over the gross margin percentage increased to from as dayrates and utilization for all liftboat classes increased 
the fleet s average dayrate increased over and utilization increased from to 
marine revenue  average day rate and margins benefited from the increased size of our liftboat fleet as a result of our acquisitions and from higher demand for production related services and offshore construction support services 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  increasing over the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at in and the increase in revenue is attributable to higher demand for drilling related tools  such as drill pipe and accessories  gravel packs  high pressure connecting iron  and on site accommodations  and increased exposure to deepwater drilling activity 
also  the segment benefited from additional rentals related to acquisitions made in and other oilfield services segment revenue from the other oilfield services segment increased to million in from million in the gross margin percentage increased to in from in these increases were driven mainly by higher demand for our environmental maintenance services  as well as our offshore and dockside tank and vessel services related to increases in gulf of mexico drilling activity 
the segment also experienced increased activity for its contract operations  supplemental labor and offshore construction and fabrication services 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in the increase primarily resulted from our larger asset base as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures during and general and administrative general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from for the percentage decrease is due to increased activity levels and higher pricing for many of our services 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million in the increase is primarily the result of our acquisitions and our increased activity levels 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million 
we supplemented our cash flow with the sale of million shares of common stock during the first quarter of  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we made million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was for liftboats including the purchase of a foot class liftboat  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory and approximately million was used on facilities construction including our facility in broussard  louisiana 
we also made million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention group and other oilfield services group 
in january  we acquired ett by converting million of notes and other receivables into ownership of ett to further expand our environmental services 
additional consideration  if any  will be based upon a multiple of four times ett s annual average ebitda less million  to be determined in the second quarter of while the amount of additional consideration payable depends upon ett s operating performance and is difficult to predict accurately  we currently estimate that the total additional consideration  if any  will not exceed million 
in june  we made an approximate million investment in a rental tool company  lamb energy services  llc lamb energy  through the contribution of an million note receivable and million of rental tool assets 
the equity in loss from our investment in this affiliate was approximately  from june to december  lamb energy established a million credit facility with a syndicate of banks that matures in we have fully guaranteed amounts outstanding under the credit facility and we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of this guarantee 
as of december   lamb energy had million outstanding under its credit facility 
we have outstanding million of senior notes due the indenture governing the senior notes requires semi annual interest payments  which commenced november   and continue through the maturity date of may  the indenture governing the senior notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  prevent us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense is at least to  except that we may incur additional debt in an amount equal to of our net tangible assets as defined  which was approximately million at december  the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we also have a bank credit facility with term loans in an aggregate amount of million at december  and a revolving credit facility of million 
on september   we amended one of the financial covenants in our credit facility to increase the maximum ratio of our debt to ebitda since our ebitda for the trailing twelve months has declined due to decreased activity levels in we also amended our capital expenditures covenant to increase our permitted capital expenditures in to million from million to allow us to continue to expand our fixed asset base 
the credit facility bears interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
as of march   the amounts outstanding under the term loans were million  million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facility was per annum 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our capital expenditures  our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  make changes to our capital structure  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
in april  we closed a million us government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of which is administered by the maritime administration marad for the construction of two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  which began december   and mature june  our obligations are secured by the two liftboats 
in accordance with the agreement  we are required to comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt and operating leases 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments of this kind 
description thereafter long term debt     operating leases    total       the table does not include the guarantee of the lamb energy services million credit facility under which million was outstanding as of december   or any potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of our acquisitions 
additional consideration is generally based on the acquired company s operating performance after the acquisition as measured by ebitda and other adjustments intended to exclude extraordinary items 
while the amounts payable depend upon the acquired company s operating performance and are difficult to predict accurately  we currently estimate that the maximum additional consideration payable for all of our acquisitions was million  with million potentially payable in and million in these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements 
we have identified capital expenditure projects that will require up to million in  exclusive of any acquisitions 
we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
in  we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility

we are in the process of determining what impact  if any  the adoption of the provisions of fin will have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for most of our international operations is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations are paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally are denominated in the same currency 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we make limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are traded with creditworthy major financial institutions 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
interest rates on occasion  we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure 
under interest rate swap agreements  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specific intervals  the difference between fixed rate and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
as of december   we were party to an interest rate swap with an approximate notional amount of million designed to convert a similar amount of variable rate debt to fixed rates 
the swap matured in october  and the interest rate was 
the effect on our earnings and other comprehensive income vary from period to period and will be dependent upon prevailing interest rates 
during and  losses of approximately  and  respectively  were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   we recorded a payable of approximately  and a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately  net of income tax 
no such agreements were outstanding at december  at december   million of our long term debt had variable interest rates 
based on debt outstanding at december   a increase in variable interest rates would increase our interest expense in the year by approximately  while a decrease would decrease our interest expense by approximately
