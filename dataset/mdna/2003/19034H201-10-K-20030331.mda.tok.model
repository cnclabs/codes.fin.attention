item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item directors and executive officers of the registrant 
amendments to the services and support agreements are approved by the audit committee of our board of directors  which consists of independent directors of coast dental 
we are dependent on revenue from coast pa and the loss of compensation received from them pursuant to the services and support agreements would have a material adverse effect on us 
see notes  and to the financial statements for further information about the services and support agreement and amendments made in fiscal years and governmental and state regulations our operations and relationships are subject to a variety of governmental and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of our business and business corporations in general 
we believe that we exercise care in an effort to structure our practices and arrangements with dental practices to comply with relevant federal and state law and believes that such arrangements and practices comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes and regulations 
the health care industry and dental practices are highly regulated  and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future 
in general  regulation of health care providers and companies is increasing 
the laws of many states prohibit corporations that are not owned entirely by dentists from employing dentists and in some states  dental hygienists and dental assistants  having control over clinical decision making  or engaging in other activities that are deemed to constitute or impinge upon the clinical practice of dentistry 
florida law specifically prohibits non professional corporations from employing dentists and dental hygienists  exercising control over patient records and making decisions relating to clinical matters  office personnel  hours of practice  pricing  credit  refunds  warranties and advertising 
under georgia law  a corporation may employ dentists only if the entity is organized as a professional corporation or association whose stockholders or members are licensed dentists 
georgia dentists must maintain patient records that document the course of treatment and may not waive co payment or bill a third party for more than the usual fee 
we do not employ dentists or dental hygienists and do not exercise control over any prohibited areas 
while adam diasti  dds  the sole stockholder of coast dds  is also a major stockholder  director and executive officer of coast dental  he acts independently when making decisions in these areas on behalf of coast pa and coast dental has no control over his decisions in these areas 
some states  including florida  georgia  tennessee and virginia  also prohibit non professional corporations from owning  maintaining or operating an office for the practice of dentistry 
these laws have generally been construed to permit arrangements under which the dentists are not employed by or otherwise controlled as to clinical matters by the party supplying facilities and non professional services 
florida law specifically requires that dentists or their professional corporations maintain complete care  custody and control of all equipment and materials used in the practice of dentistry 
the services and support agreements between coast dental and coast pa expressly provide that we shall not exercise control over any matters that would violate the requirements of the applicable state law 
many states also prohibit fee splitting by dentists with any party except other dentists in the same professional corporation or practice entity 
in most cases  these laws have been construed as applying to the practice of paying a portion of a fee to another person for referring a patient or otherwise generating business  and not to prohibit payment of reasonable compensation for facilities and services other than the generation of referrals  even if the payment is based on a percentage of the practice s revenues 
the florida fee splitting law prohibits paying or receiving any commission  bonus  kickback or rebate  or engaging in any split fee arrangement in any form with a dentist for patient referrals to dentists or other providers of health care goods and services 
according to florida court of appeals decision interpreting this law  it does not prohibit a management fee that is based on a percentage of gross income of a professional practice if the manager does not refer patients to the practice 
regulatory boards can come to different conclusions than those reached by a judicial body in analyzing laws 
for example  the florida board of medicine made a determination in applying the florida fee splitting law  that under certain circumstances  a management fee based upon a percentage of revenue will be found by them to be illegal 
while the florida board of medicine does not have jurisdiction over dentistry  there can be no assurance that the florida board of dentistry will not adopt a similar result 

table of contents many states  including florida  georgia  tennessee and virginia  prohibit dentists from using advertising  which includes any name other than their own  or from advertising in any manner that is likely to lead a person to believe that a non dentist is engaged in the practice of dentistry 
the services and support agreements provide that all advertising shall conform to these requirements 
florida law also requires all advertising to identify the florida dentist who assumes total responsibility for the advertisement and may not include the name of a person who is not either actually involved in the practice of dentistry at the advertised location or an owner of the practice being advertised 
georgia law requires that advertising must contain the name of at least one dentist practicing at the location unless the georgia board of dentistry has approved the use of a trade name 
virginia law does not allow the use of a trade name at all 
these laws have civil and criminal penalties and have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation 
they are enforced by regulatory agencies that are vested with broad discretion in interpreting their meaning 
federal or state authorities have not examined the company s agreements and activities under these laws and regulations 
for these reasons  there can be no assurance that review of our business arrangements or the operation of the dental centers will not result in determinations that adversely affect our operations or that the long term services and support agreements or certain of its provisions will not be held invalid and unenforceable 
in addition  these laws and their interpretation vary from state to state 
the laws and regulations of certain states into which the company may seek to expand in the future may require us to change the form of relationships entered into with dentists in a manner that restricts our operations in those states 
congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  in among other things  hipaa established several requirements regarding the privacy  security and electronic transmission of health information 
the department of health and human services  or hhs  has issued several regulations 
in general  these regulations apply to health care providers  health plans  and health care clearinghouses 
among these requirements  health care providers are required to enter into agreements with their business associates that concern the protection of health information 
we are considered under hipaa to be a business associate of coast pa  which is a health care provider 
pursuant to hipaa  hhs issued final privacy regulations establishing comprehensive federal standards relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information 
these regulations  among other things  establish limits on the use and release of protected health information  provide for patients rights to access  amend  and receive an accounting of the uses and disclosures of protected health information  and require certain safeguards to protect identifiable health information 
the federal privacy regulations do not supersede state laws that are more stringent 
thus  we must reconcile both the federal privacy regulations and other state privacy laws that are more stringent than the federal laws 
coast pa must be in compliance with the federal privacy regulations by april  we are assisting coast pa in working towards compliance with the federal privacy regulations by that date 
like the privacy regulations  the electronic transaction standards are also final 
the electronic transaction regulations establish uniform standards relating to data reporting  formatting  and coding that covered entities must use in conducting certain electronic transactions 
upon the compliance date  health care providers and business associates must use these standards when electronically transmitting a covered transaction with health plans or other health care providers 
the compliance date for these regulations was october   unless an extension was requested  which automatically extends the compliance date to october  we did file the necessary extension so our compliance date has been extended to october  we have arranged to contract with health care clearinghouses to enable electronic claim on behalf of coast pa to comply with these regulations 
the hipaa security regulations were finalized on february  the purpose of the proposed security regulations is to establish a minimum standard for the protection of electronic health information that is stored or transmitted electronically 
the regulations provide administrative procedures  physical safeguards  and technical mechanisms that may be implemented to satisfy the regulations 
health care providers are required to comply with the security regulations by april  we believe that health care regulations will continue to change  and as a result  we regularly monitors developments in health care law 
we expect to modify our agreements and operations from time to time  if necessary  as the business and regulatory environment change 
however  there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect our ability to operate as we currently do or to remain profitable in doing so 

table of contents competition we are aware of several other companies that are actively engaged in the consolidation of existing dental practices and providing business services to dental practices  some of which may have longer operating histories than us 
we assume that additional companies with similar objectives may enter our markets and compete with us 
the primary basis of competition between dental practice management companies include  but are not limited to availability and cost of financing growth  extent of working capital  liquidity  the extent of the dental care network  management expertise and experience  sophistication of management information systems  the elements of its operating system  the relative motivation and productivity of affiliated dentists  the availability and profitability of managed care business and practice management  and opportunity for career enhancement agreements 
the business of providing dental practice management services is highly competitive in each of the markets in which the dental centers operate 
the primary basis of competition within the dental services industry are price of services  marketing exposure  convenience of location and traffic flow of location  hours of operation  reputation  managed care contracts  quality of care and appearance and usefulness of facilities and equipment 
coast dentists compete with other dentists who maintain group practices or operate in multiple offices 
many of those dentists have more established practices in their markets 
seasonality we have traditionally experienced our highest volume of patient visits during the first and last quarters of the year and our lowest volume of patient visits in the summer 
individual dental centers typically experience increased patient visits during the period from october through march  when the population of florida increases for the winter  and decreased patient visits during the summer months 
dental centers located outside of florida provided   and of total revenue to coast pa for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also expect that certain factors may mitigate this seasonality including growth in the markets served outside of florida  coast smile plus discount fee plan membership programs and patient financing programs 
seasonality in fee for service business is partially mitigated by capitation revenue from managed care contracts  which is earned on an equal pro rata basis over the year 
for the years ended december   and  capitation revenue from managed care contracts represented  and  respectively  of total revenue to coast pa 
service marks we believe our service marks are important to us 
we have registered the trademarks coast dental  coast dental and design logo  coast dental our smiles are everywhere  our smiles are everywhere  own a practice that doesn t own you  we ll give you every reason to smile and the coast dental logo with the united states patent and trademarks office 
employees as of december   we had approximately full time and part time employees  of whom were employed at our headquarters and were employed at the dental centers or in regional management 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
the number of people employed by us has increased from the levels maintained in and the increase in was in the dental center personnel necessary to accommodate the increased level of business volume per day and the increased number of doctor days and hygienist days at coast pa item properties we presently lease an average of  square feet of office space for each of the dental centers 
the typical lease for office space is for a term of approximately five years and generally provides for renewal options for additional years 
we estimate that the renewal options will be exercised and the average lease term will be ten years 
the average rental payments for a leased dental center are approximately  per month 
we plan to continue to lease rather than purchase space for the dental centers to preserve our available capital 

table of contents we lease  square feet of office space in tampa  florida for our corporate headquarters 
this lease is for a term of three years and expires january  we anticipate that we can successfully renew or obtain suitable new leases for our dental centers  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we believe that our leased properties are adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for such purposes 
we will enter into new leases when we open new dental centers 
current locations number of locations west florida central florida east florida georgia tennessee virginia total item legal proceedings we are a party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings or other claims arising in the ordinary course of business  including matters related to the dental services provided to patients by coast pa to date  these proceedings have not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that in future periods these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we previously disclosed in our most recent form k and form q that we are a party to employee related matters two of which are collective action complaints 
settlements have been reached for three such matters with a maximum cost to us totaling  including plaintiff s legal fees and expenses 
through december   payments on these three matters totaling  have been made and we expect to make the remaining payments in the next two quarters 
we are a business services company that provides comprehensive business services and support to general dentistry practices and we do not provide or perform dental services 
the dental services are provided to patients solely by licensed dentists and dental hygienists employed by coast pa we are named as a party in several professional liability matters brought by patients against coast pa however  we do not expect to have any liability exposure because we do not provide or perform dental services 
furthermore  we have never been found liable in a professional liability lawsuit for dental services provided by a dental professional 
however  there can be no assurance that in the future a court of law will not find us liable in a professional liability lawsuit 
while the outcome of the pending legal and administrative proceedings and other claims cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not expect the pending matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
we have accrued amounts we believe are appropriate at the present time with respect to the pending and settled legal and administrative proceedings and other claims based upon discussions with legal counsel and the nature and present status of such proceedings 
the company intends to vigorously defend our positions in each of the pending matters

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a 
overview we opened our first dental center in may as of december   we provide comprehensive business services and support to dental centers consisting of internally developed and acquired dental centers  net of consolidations and closings 
we derive our revenue through fees earned from coast pa for providing comprehensive business services and support at the dental centers  located in florida  georgia  tennessee and virginia 
as of december   coast dentists and hygienists were employed by coast pa  serving approximately  patients and there were approximately  unique provider visits during coast pa and coast dental plans to grow by utilizing existing excess capacity 
once the excess capacity is optimized  coast pa and coast dental expect to expand the coast dental network in new and existing markets through the addition of internally developed and strategically opportunistic acquired dental centers 
relationship with coast pa the entities comprising coast pa are all owned by a related party adam diasti  dds  who is a director  president and a majority stockholder of coast dental 
we have year evergreen dental services agreements service and support agreements with each entity comprising coast pa whereby we receive fees for services and support provided to dental practices operated by coast pa coast pa employs dentists and dental hygienists and provides all of the dental services to patients 
as employer of dentists and dental hygienists  coast pa incurs the cost of dentist and hygienist compensation  benefits  and certain other expenses 
pursuant to the services and support agreements  we earn a service and support fee from coast pa to provide comprehensive business services and support to each dental center 
in providing these comprehensive business services and support to the dental centers  we incur all of the remaining operating expenses incurred by the dental centers including employee costs for assistants and office staff  dental supplies and lab fees  occupancy  advertising and dental center administrative costs 
we do not employ dentists and hygienists and  accordingly  dental center salaries and benefits presented on the statement of operations does not include the salaries and benefits of dentists and hygienists 
in addition  we acquire the property and equipment  leases the facilities and improves the facilities in order to operate the dental centers 
dependence on coast pa we receive fees for services and support provided to coast pa under the services and support agreements  but do not employ dentists or hygienists or control the dental practices of coast pa our net revenue is dependent on gross patient revenue generated by coast pa and  therefore  effective and continued performance of coast pa and its dentists and hygienists during the term of the services and support agreements is essential to our long term success 
services and support agreement with coast pa we have year evergreen dental services agreements services and support agreements with each entity comprising coast pa whereby we receive fees for services and support provided to coast pa net revenue represents the aggregate fees charged to coast pa under the agreements during the year 
gross patient revenue earned by coast pa at its dental practices is at established rates  net of refunds  adjustments and discounts 
the costs incurred by coast pa include primarily dentist and hygienist salaries and benefits 
the service and support fee arrangements have been agreed to between the principal and sole owner of coast pa  adam diasti  pa  who is a director  president and a majority stockholder of coast dental  and the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of coast dental  terek diasti 
the services and support fee agreements and any amendments thereto are approved by the audit committee  which is comprised of independent directors 
the factors considered in setting those fees  which reflect the fair market value of our services and support  included our evaluation of the services it provides  the costs incurred by us in connection with providing the services and our negotiated return  balanced against coast pa s requirement for a retained amount which ensures its financial viability  contemplation of a long term relationship with us and the future business opportunity related thereto 
only the service fees earned by us for services and support to coast pa and our actual expenses are reflected in our financial statements 
neither the expenses of coast pa nor any of the patient gross revenues earned by coast pa are reflected in the financial statements 

table of contents historically  the service and support fee was based on a percent of the gross patient revenues of coast pa net of refunds  discounts  and adjustments and inclusive of capitation revenues 
effective february   the service and support fee became of dental center gross revenue and effective january   the service and support fee became of dental center gross revenue  with an allowable range of to 
the percentage was unchanged in  and through may  effective june   coast dental and coast pa amended the services and support agreement to change the methodology for determining the monthly services and support fee earned and to provide for coast pa to grant us a secured interest in coast pa s trade accounts receivable for payment of services and support fees 
these changes were precipitated by the favorable impact on financial performance of dental centers converted to the recently implemented equity model  which model coast dental and coast pa believe provides the equity doctor and coast pa an incentive for improving overall financial performance of each dental center 
this amendment incorporates the financial performance of each dental center in the determination of the services and support fee earned by us 
the audit committee of the board of directors approved the amendment to the services and support agreement 
effective june   the services and support fee earned by us for each dental center is based on a combination of the actual costs of services provided and the financial performance of the dental centers 
as compensation for its services and support of the dental centers  we earn a two part monthly services and support fee based on the actual direct and indirect expenses incurred in providing the services and support to the dental centers including employee costs  supplies  advertising  occupancy  and dental center administrative costs  and the financial performance of the dental centers 
the performance based portion of the fee is set at of the excess of net dental services revenue over direct and indirect dental center operating expenses 
effective october   coast dental and coast pa amended the services and support agreement to calculate the performance based portion of the service and support fee on the aggregate financial performance of all dental centers and not on the stand alone financial performance of each dental center 
the audit committee of the board of directors approved this amendment to the services and support agreement 
expansion through acquisitions acquisitions made with coast pa coast dental and coast pa in prior years have jointly entered into asset purchase agreements with existing dental practices 
coast pa acquired the patient lists and any other professional assets and we acquired certain tangible assets  principally the dental equipment  and assumed certain liabilities such as the lease agreement for the facility 
the fair value of the patient lists was determined based upon general market information received from an independent dental practice transition consultant regarding traditional dental practice acquisitions 
in addition to the purchase price allocations for tangible assets  there are allocations for identifiable intangible assets and non identifiable intangible assets 
the identifiable intangible assets allocation was to non compete agreements  which are partially allocated to us and partially allocated to coast pa the purchase price allocation to coast pa was limited to the value of the patient files and an amount representing the estimated value of coast pa s right to prohibit the selling professional association and its dentist s from competing in the dental business within the specified area surrounding the acquired dental center 
after a determination of the fair value of the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  the remaining purchase price representing non identifiable intangible assets was allocated to coast dental and coast pa as the value of the dental service agreements ie the services and support agreements attributable to the dental center 
recent developments overview during and  coast dental and coast pa embarked upon several new initiatives  some of which are described in more detail later in this section  to help return us to profitability and to better position us if this turnaround is achieved 
as described in previous filings  there is excess capacity in existing dental centers  which coast pa believes it can best utilize by increasing the number of dental professionals in these dental centers 
during the years and  coast pa has made progress toward increasing the number of dental professionals  increasing the number of days each week that dental centers serve patients and increasing the number of hours each day that dental centers are open 
each of these accomplishments improves our ability to increase net revenue  leverage the fixed costs associated with each dental center and improve profitability 
we have assisted coast pa in focusing its advertising approach to attract higher margin fee for service and private insurance business to replace the lower margin managed care business it elected to reduce in scope in late and grow net revenue 
in addition to shifting the advertising and marketing approach  we have worked with coast pa on the development and implementation of its own  branded discount plan  coast smile plus 
the purpose of this plan is to attract patients that do not have dental insurance and develop a loyalty by offering a discount from full fee for 
table of contents service pricing which is comparable to private insurance pricing 
as described later in this section  coast dental and coast pa have arranged for a national financial institution to provide financing to patients of the coast pa who meet the credit issuer s criteria for lending 
as also described later in this section  coast dental and coast pa have made progress in the rollout of the dentist equity model 
recent developments self tender offer on march   we initiated a self tender offer the offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock for per share 
following completion of the offer  due to the very small shareholder base and the infrequent trading activity of our common stock  we intend to delist our common stock from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market and to terminate the registration of our common stock under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
if this occurs  we will become a private company and there will be no public market for our common stock 
the purpose of the offer is to provide shareholders with liquidity for the common stock prior to delisting and deregistration for a price that a special committee consisting of independent members of the board of directors has determined to be fair to coast dental s shareholders other than the continuing shareholders as defined below 
although the offer is being made to all holders of coast dental common stock  terek diasti  chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of coast dental  adam diasti  a director and president of the company  and the diasti family limited partnership  collectively referred to as the continuing shareholders who beneficially own approximately of our common stock currently issued and outstanding including all company common stock issuable pursuant to currently exercisable stock options have advised us that they do not intend to tender any of their shares of coast dental common stock pursuant to the offer 
we plan to finance the offer through borrowings from the term loan portion of the  revolving credit  term loan and security agreement with capital source finance llc capitalsource which includes a  revolver and a  term loan the term loan and from coast dental s largest shareholder  the diasti family limited partnership  under an agreement to loan up to  the credit agreement 
coast dental will be the borrower under the term loan and the credit agreement 
we plan to repay the term loan and the credit agreement when due through internally generated funds 
the term loan provides that capitalsource will loan us up to  to finance the offer at an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus 
the principal of the term loan is payable in monthly installments in months seven through twenty four from the date the funds are borrowed 
the term loan is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets and will be guaranteed by the diasti family limited partnership 
we will be required to prepay all or a portion of the term loan under certain circumstances 
we will be required to meet certain monthly financial covenants for minimum ebitda as defined  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net leverage  minimum cash collections and minimum liquidity in order to initially borrow and maintain borrowings under the term loan 
there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet these monthly financial covenants 
we are also subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants 
upon borrowing on the term loan  we are required to issue warrants to capitalsource which are immediately exercisable into of the company s issued and outstanding common stock at a strike price equal to

we have the option to redeem the warrant upon the conclusion of a successful tender offer 
the credit agreement provides that the diasti family limited partnership will loan us up to  to finance the offer at an interest rate of 
the loan will be due five years from the date the funds are borrowed 
the loan is subordinated to the term loan and  subject to the prior approval of capitalsource  will be secured by a second priority lien on all of our assets 
we do not have any alternative financing arrangements or alternative financing plans in the event it is unable to borrow  for any reason  under the term loan or the credit agreement 
as a condition of drawing on the million capitalsource term loan to finance the offer  the diasti family limited partnership and coast pa will guarantee certain of our indebtedness under the million credit facility with capitalsource 
we have and will continue to incur substantial costs in connection with the self tender offer 
recent developments capacity utilization in an effort to utilize its excess capacity  increase gross revenues and improve profitability  commencing in july  coast pa hired net dentists in the second half of  increasing the number of dentists from at june   to at december   representing an increase of 
commencing in july coast pa  hired net 
table of contents hygienists in the second half of  increasing the number of hygienists from at june  to at december   representing an increase of 
as of december   coast pa employed dentists or a net decrease of dentists over december  reflecting the closing and consolidation of eight dental centers and sale of one dental center in as of december   coast pa employed hygienists or a decrease of one hygienist over december  despite the decrease in the number of dentists employed as of december by coast pa  total doctor days for coast pa increased in fiscal year by from  to  reflecting an increase in the number of days the dental centers were opened and staffed with dentists 
total hygienist days for coast pa increased in fiscal year by from  to  reflecting an increase in the number of days the dental centers were opened and staffed with hygienists 
recent developments payor mix in the period from december to december  the payor mix of coast pa has been shifted from managed care to managed care 
for the year ended december   of coast pa s patient revenues were derived from higher margin fee for service and private insurance business  up significantly from for the year ended december recent developments patient financing program in late january  a private label  revolving credit program sponsored by a national financial institution became available to patients of coast pa who meet certain minimum credit standards 
we believe that this program will increase incremental revenues because it provides an additional payment option to patients of coast pa who otherwise might avoid or delay dental treatment plans  or accept a lower cost or less effective treatment due to the inability to pay for the preferred treatment at the time the service is rendered 
in addition  we believe this program will assist coast pa in reducing its exposure to uncollectible patient accounts receivable and help to improve overall cash flow 
there are a few financing options available to patients at all times  with promotional type financing options available during certain times of the year 
this program includes a pre approved credit program that will reduce patient wait time in the office while credit lines are approved 
our first year results with this program have been positive with patient s financing approximately  of dental services with coast pa the average patient transaction utilizing the financing program has been approximately times higher than the overall average patient transaction 
recent developments coast smile plus membership and discount plan the coast pa implemented a membership and discount plan called coast smile plus in patients joining the membership plan can access a reduced fee schedule 
the pricing of the fee schedule offered to members is discounted from fee for service pricing but is competitive with the pricing collected from private insurance payors and higher than pricing from managed care payors 
the goal of this membership program is to build loyalty and generate repeat business for the dental centers 
also effective february  membership fees and all dental services purchased by coast smile plus members can be charged on the coast dental patient financing program 
in  this membership and discount program was piloted and memberships were sold passively through point of sale marketing in the dental centers 
without any external marketing programs  approximately  memberships were generated in coast pa generated million in gross revenue from coast smile plus members or of its gross revenue 
in  coast dental and coast pa piloted and then withdrew an initiative to market the coast smile plus membership and discount plan to large organizations  large employers and traditional distribution channels for supplemental insurance and discount medical programs 
after this pilot  we continue to sell through passive point of sale marketing in the dental centers 
approximately  memberships were generated in and coast pa generated million in patient revenue from coast smile plus members or approximately of its patient revenues 
coast p 
a is optimistic that this membership and discount plan will continue to improve the payor mix 
recent developments managed care during the latter part of  coast pa began notifying managed care companies that it would continue to provide service to existing members but would not accept new members to the managed care roster known as panels in any of its dental centers until re negotiations had occurred 
a thorough review of utilization data revealed that the majority of patient 
table of contents visits consisted of managed care patients  yet the fees earned in connection with this business were below that of discounted fee for service patients 
this resulted in in depth discussions with each of the managed care companies 
in some cases  agreements were reached whereby the panels were reopened 
in other situations  agreements could not be reached and the panels remained closed as discussions continued or the contracts were terminated 
since december   agreements have been terminated with managed care companies 
two of these companies were more significant to coast pa s operation while the remainder were smaller and less significant

recent developments dentist equity model update due to issues apparent in the dental practice management sector relative to maximizing dentists long term productivity and commitment to the success of such relationship  coast pa  with our assistance  developed a dentist equity model the equity model whereby a dentist has the opportunity to acquire a to ownership interest in a dental center and participate in the potential profits of that dental center 
this opportunity was previously unavailable to a coast dentist 
the purpose of this change in operating model is to provide affiliated dentists the opportunity to satisfy certain long term career goals and thereby address the retention and motivational concern that coast pa  and the dental practice management industry in general  is facing 
during the third quarter of  coast pa  with our assistance  began the rollout of the newly developed dentist equity model 
these transactions are structured as a sale of intangible and or tangible assets of each dental center 
coast pa sells a portion of its intangible dental center assets to the dentist acquiring the interest 
coast pa and the dentist then contribute their respective tangible and intangible assets to a newly formed professional association 
the dentist acquires an ownership interest in certain of the assets of the dental center and finances all or a portion of the purchase price with a secured note payable 
the general terms of the notes are seven years at interest with an interest only period designed to provide each selected dentist with a period of time during which the revenues of the dental center can be improved and the cost structure can be optimized 
the equity doctor dental centers continue to operate under the existing services and support agreement with coast dental 
coast dental and coast pa consummated the sale of interests in dental centers under the equity model as follows ten in and six in in fourth quarter  coast dental and coast pa divested one equity model dental center and sold the business and remaining assets to the owner dentist 
in addition  in fourth quarter  coast dental  coast pa and four owner dentists dissolved four of the equity model dental centers and the dentists remained in the practice and became employees of coast pa continued rollout of the equity model is dependent upon reaching agreements with selected dentists  and there can be no assurance that any such agreements can be reached 
the additional number of dental centers that will be affected is unknown and it is uncertain  at this time  what ultimate effect the equity model  will have on our overall asset mix  liquidity or performance 
if the implementation is successful  the company expects to improve its liquidity and cash position  in the long term  as well as to create an environment where select dentists with a meaningful ownership interest will have a more significant personal and financial interest in the productivity and success of the dental center 
correspondingly  until anticipated growth occurs at these dental centers  our cash flows in currently profitable dental centers can initially decline 

table of contents to date  we have experienced a favorable impact from the implementation of the equity model 
our gross profit percentage for the eleven equity doctor dental centers as of december  is approximately twice the gross profit percentage of the company as a whole 
this reflects both increases in net revenues and the controlling of variable costs at the dental centers
