item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results generally do not differ materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
inventory is valued using the cost method which values inventory at the lower of the actual cost or market  at the individual item level 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
inventory levels are reviewed to identify slow moving and closeout merchandise that will no longer be carried 
market is determined by the estimated net realizable value  based upon the merchandise selling price 

table of contents finite long lived assets 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
insurance accruals 
our consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation and general liability claims 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on a discounted basis  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
sales returns 
we estimate future sales returns and  when material  record a provision in the period that the related sales are recorded based on historical information 
should actual returns differ from our estimates  we would be required to revise estimated sales returns 
store closure costs 
we will record estimated store closure costs  such as fixed asset write offs  estimated lease commitment costs net of estimated sublease income and other miscellaneous store closing costs  when the liability is incurred 
such estimates may be subject to change should actual costs differ 
general net sales 
net sales include same store sales and new store sales 
same store sales include sales for those stores that were in operation for a full period in both the current month and the corresponding month for the prior year 
new store sales include sales in the current fiscal year from stores opened during the previous fiscal year before they are considered same stores and new stores opened in the current fiscal year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  freight to the stores and store occupancy costs

corporate level expenses are primarily attributable to our corporate office in rockaway  new jersey

for the fiscal year ended june  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  with the objective of improving financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights  or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
historically  entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we have evaluated the accounting provisions of the interpretations and there was no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  since the company is not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities

this statement establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the statement will be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the period of adoption 
although we are still in the process of reviewing the new statement  we believe this statement will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that inflation did not have a material impact on our operations for the periods reported 
significant increases in cost of merchandise purchased  labor  employee benefits and other operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
seasonality our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our net sales  cash flow and net income in the second fiscal quarter of the year principally due to the sales in october for the halloween season and  to a lesser extent  due to holiday sales for end of year holidays 
we expect that this general pattern will continue 
our results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the timing of new store openings and store closings and the timing of the acquisition and disposition of stores 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to interest rate change and market risk 
as borrowing patterns are cyclical  we are not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
therefore  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the loan agreement is dependent on  at the company s option  i at the adjusted eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin  which was set initially at per annum  and is currently at per annum  or ii at the prime rate less the applicable margin  which was set initially at per annum may  during peak borrowing  have a negative impact on short term results
