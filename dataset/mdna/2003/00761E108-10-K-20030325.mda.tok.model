item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of high performance power semiconductors and modules for both switching and rf applications 
power semiconductors manage and regulate electrical power by converting electricity into a form required by electrical and electronic products 
our power semiconductors increase system efficiency  permit the design of more compact end products and improve features and functionality 
we are primarily focused on the high power  high frequency segment of the power semiconductor market 
high power refers to the ability to dissipate above one kilowatt  and high frequency refers to the ability to switch on and off at rates above kilohertz 
in addition we are strengthening our portfolio of rf products that operate at frequencies ranging from megahertz to megahertz 
rf generally refers to the ability to operate at frequencies above megahertz 
we sell our products primarily in north america  europe  and asia  through a network of independent sales representatives and distributors 
to further our penetration in rf markets  we completed the acquisition of ghz technology  inc and the business of microsemi rf products  inc 
in january and may  respectively 
these acquisitions are part of the company s ongoing strategy to expand its product and technology portfolio in the rf power arena through both internal development and acquisitions 
we believe that these acquisitions serve to position apt as an emerging  dominant supplier in bipolar rf power transistors for avionics  radar and non cellular communications applications 
these acquisitions have added valuable rf technology and substantial rf engineering  manufacturing and marketing capability to the company 
in august  we completed an initial public offering  or ipo  of  shares of our common stock  including the underwriters over allotment  at an offering price of per share 
the ipo included  shares sold by apt and  shares sold by shareholders of apt  and resulted in net proceeds to apt of approximately million 
the net remaining proceeds are currently held in various investments and will be used for general corporate purposes  including research and development and possible acquisitions 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol apti 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
certain statements contained herein may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  as discussed more fully herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates advanced power technology s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires apt to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  apt evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns and warranty obligations  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  income taxes  valuation of intangible assets including goodwill  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation  and excess component order cancellation costs 
apt bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
apt believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product returns and warranty obligations standard product revenue is recognized upon shipment of product 
apt recognizes revenue on customer specific products or services based on the terms of customer contracts which are generally based on customer acceptance 
in general  apt provides for a one year repair or replacement warranty on its products 
upon shipment  apt also provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for product warranty and sales returns based on historical experience 
apt uses independent distributors to sell its products 
distributors can return up to of the dollar value of products purchased during the prior six months upon a days notice and receive certain price protections on purchased products 
sales to distributors are recognized upon shipment  less an allowance for estimated returns based on historical experience 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  apt s warranty obligation is affected by product non conformance rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product non conformance 
should actual product non conformance rates  material usage  service delivery costs  or distributor returns differ from apt s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts apt maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  historical bad debts  the customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
management reviews significant individual accounts that are past due to determine whether an allowance should be made based on these factors 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
apt establishes reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
apt evaluates historical usage of the product  current customer demand  and forecasted usage of the product 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes apt records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while apt considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event apt were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should apt determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives apt values goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

currently apt carries a goodwill balance in connection with acquisitions made in  but has no other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we annually review goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives for impairment and when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
we determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and other acceptable valuation methodologies  which requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
valuation of long lived assets apt values goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we determine the potential impairment using undiscounted cash flow analysis  which requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect changes we anticipate in the economy and industry 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
contingencies and litigation apt is subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of net revenue years ended december  revenues  net cost of goods sold amortization of technology rights and other charges total cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative in process research development total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other  net income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss years ended december  and revenues 
our net revenues for were million  including million from ghz technology  inc ghz and the business of microsemi rf products  inc msc rf  a wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi corporation  which apt acquired effective january  and may   respectively 
this represents an increase of compared to the net revenues of million in without the additional revenues from our acquisitions  revenues were million in  representing a decline of over the prior year 
sales to distributors were approximately of total revenues in compared to in the semiconductor market experienced record growth up to october  followed by record declines in as apt typically lags the overall semiconductor industry  our revenues peaked in the first quarter of and then we experienced sequentially declining revenues through the fourth quarter of our revenues had quarterly increases from the low levels of the second half of  but still remain below the levels achieved in on a year to date basis excluding the impact of acquisitions 
we experienced sequential revenue growth of in each of the first and second quarters of  in the third quarter of  followed by a decline in the fourth quarter of  when excluding revenues from both of our acquisitions 
the year over year decline is mainly due to continued weakness of our sales into the communications and data processing market  which remains well below levels 
including the impact of the companies acquired  the increase in revenues is largely attributable to increased sales in the military and aerospace market 
the additional revenues contributed by our acquisitions are heavily weighted towards the military and aerospace market and the communications and data processing market  and therefore serve to more evenly diversify our overall revenues from the various markets that we participate in 
in addition  the revenues from the acquired companies significantly increase our position in the rf power market  consistent with our long established strategy 
during  we entered into a joint venture agreement in china  which included a license and technology transfer agreement for certain of our technologies  in exchange for cash payments totaling million over two to three years 
there were no revenues recognized from the agreement during and apt terminated this agreement in february of in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as a result  apt will not receive any future payments relative to this agreement 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in excluding the non cash purchase accounting charges for the fair value of inventory acquired and the amortization of the technology rights assets  gross profit margin was compared to in  which had no purchase accounting charges 
as described above  our revenues peaked in the first quarter of and then subsequently declined through the fourth quarter of accordingly  our gross profit margin in the first half of was followed by in the second half of due to the much lower levels of production and under utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
during  we experienced quarterly increases in revenues and production volumes  leading to improved utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities 
we also began to benefit from the cost reduction actions taken in the second half of  as more fully described in the versus gross profit section below  such as reducing our overall production personnel levels by approximately or about employees 
also contributing to our improved gross margins in is the higher content of our rf power business due to the acquisitions made during the year  which carry a higher overall gross profit rate 
our rf revenues were approximately of total revenue in compared to in we expect to continue to pursue actions in that will lower our overall production costs 
these actions include consolidation of internal wafer fabrication operations  greater utilization of low cost offshore assembly subcontractors  and the associated downsizing of our internal assembly operations 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increased spending over the prior year is primarily due to the additions of ghz and msc rf  which contributed million in  consisting mainly of payroll  supplies  facilities and depreciation charges 
excluding the impact of ghz and msc rf  research and development charges remained flat over the prior year 
the company plans to continue its research and development programs leading to the introduction of new products for use in both switching and rf applications 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in compared to million in  or approximately and of revenues in and  respectively 
the increased spending over the prior year is primarily due to the additions of ghz and msc rf  which contributed million in  consisting mainly of payroll  commissions  facilities  and depreciation charges 
excluding the impact of ghz and msc rf  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat over the prior year 
the graduated pay reductions implemented in were discontinued in the third quarter of we expect to continue to take actions to reduce selling and administrative expenses during  including consolidation of certain administrative functions and tight control of discretionary spending 
we did experience increased legal expenses over in connection with ongoing patent litigation  as more fully explained in part i  item iii to this filing 
we have denied infringement of the ixys patents and have asserted affirmative defenses to our claims 
however  the length of time and legal fees associated with the patent litigation with ixys may be significant 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements  and is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant of options and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
stock compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  typically five years 
stock compensation expense of  was recorded in versus  in of this amount   was recorded in cost of goods sold   was recorded in research and development expense and  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect to record stock compensation expense of approximately  in interest income expense 
interest income in was  compared to million in the decline in interest income was due to the use of cash and investments to acquire ghz and msc rf and also due to lower interest rates available in the current market environment 
interest expense was  in compared to  in income taxes 
we recorded a tax benefit for at an effective tax rate of approximately compared to a tax rate of in the effective tax rate benefit in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the in process research and development charges recorded for financial statement purposes in the ghz acquisition under gaap which are not deductible for tax purposes 
this was partially offset by the benefit of a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and non taxable municipal interest income 
the effective tax rate expense in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards and non taxable municipal interest income 
net loss 
although our revenues increased in over  we experienced a net loss of  versus net income of  in as a result of our acquisitions during fiscal  we recorded acquisition related charges for purchased in process research and development ipr d  amortization of intangible assets  inventory fair value adjustments and deferred compensation amortization of  of which  was included in costs of good sold and  in operating expenses 
the total amount net of taxes was  without these purchase related charges our net loss in would have been this decline in profit is primarily due to a decline in revenues on our existing business before acquisitions  resulting in lower gross profit while our operating expenses remained relatively flat on a before acquisition basis 
this resulted in an operating loss on our existing business  which was partially offset by an operating profit on our acquired business 
the company plans to continue pursuing cost containment strategies including consolidation of manufacturing and administrative operations in order to lower our expenses 
years ended december  and revenues 
our net revenues were million in  a decrease of from net revenues of million in the decrease in net revenues in resulted from significantly lower sales volumes to our customers in the communications and semiconductor capital equipment markets  which declined and  respectively from both of these markets experienced rapid and significant decreases during as demand from end customers for semiconductor equipment and telecommunications equipment dropped 
however  we experienced relative stability in our sales to the industrial  medical and military markets  which combined grew from during  we entered into a joint venture agreement in china  which included a license and technology transfer agreement for certain of our technologies  in exchange for cash payments totaling million over two to three years 
included in revenues in was  of technology licensing revenue associated with our joint venture in china 
there were no revenues recognized from the agreement during apt terminated this agreement in february of in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as a result  apt will not receive any future payments relative to this agreement 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin in was primarily due to significantly lower fixed cost absorption in the company s internal manufacturing facilities  higher levels of non quality related product returns  and increased inventory reserves 
due to the rapid and significant drop in demand for our products as noted above  management took direct action to adjust production levels and control inventory 
temporary plant shutdowns were implemented in the third and fourth quarters of these shutdowns required employees to take time off without pay or use accrued vacation balances 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  production crews were put on half schedules 
these shutdowns did not involve permanent plant closures or reductions in staff 
however  in addition to the temporary shutdowns described above  permanent work force reductions were also made 
the permanent reductions in production personnel were employees in september and an additional in february there were no material severance costs associated with either of these workforce reductions and therefore no restructuring accruals or charges were taken 
orders to our manufacturing subcontractors were also decreased 
the overall result of these actions was to lower wafer production levels by approximately in the second half of versus levels in the first half of the lower internal production levels contributed to lower fixed cost absorption and deteriorated our margin by approximately 
in addition  we had higher levels of non quality related product returns due to stock rotation rights given to our distributors and some customer returns of excess inventory that bore a high standard margin 
overall  product returns were approximately in the second half of versus in the first half of and in during we also increased inventory reserves due to higher estimates of excess inventories on hand 
we increased reserves in the third and fourth quarter of by  and in total by  for versus  in finally  gross profit in included  related to the technology licensing revenue associated with our joint venture in china  while in we had no revenues from the joint venture 
see revenues above 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses were million in  an increase of from research and development expenses of million in the increase in research and development expenses in primarily resulted from increased spending on supplies and materials used in research and development projects 
as a percent of net revenues  research and development expense increased to in from in  due to both increased spending and lower revenues in our research and development efforts are focused on the advancement of our core technologies  as evidenced by the deployment of a large number of products based on our power mos technology in  and the development and introduction of new products in derivative and radio frequency technologies 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of from selling  general and administrative expenses of million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in principally resulted from  of decreased commissions on lower revenues   of lower salaries due to graduated pay reductions and temporary company shutdowns  and overall reduced discretionary spending in the current market environment 
as mentioned above  the company implemented temporary shutdowns in the third and fourth quarter of  as well as a permanent reduction in force that affected three administrative employees 
in addition  in  the company implemented graduated pay reductions applied to all domestic employees beginning in the third quarter that were increased in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the pay reductions  shutdowns  and work force reductions  payroll expenses were reduced by on an annualized basis from the payroll levels in the first half of selling  general and administrative expenses also include amortization of goodwill of  in versus none in  related to the purchase of apt by six of our senior officers 
as a percent of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense increased to in from in  primarily due to the decrease in net revenues 
stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense includes costs relating to stock based employee compensation arrangements  and is based on the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant of options and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock 
stock compensation expense is recognized over the vesting periods of the related options  typically five years 
stock compensation expense of  was recorded in versus  in of this amount   was recorded in cost of goods sold   was recorded in research and development expense and  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
interest income expense 
interest expense decreased to  in from million in the decrease in interest expense in was principally a result of the reduction of outstanding debt from the application of proceeds from our ipo in early august see overview above 
we had interest income of million in an increase from  in  nearly all of which we earned on the investment of proceeds from our ipo in august income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in compared to in the effective tax rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
the effective tax rate in was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes and other permanent differences and was partially offset by the benefit of a reduction in the valuation allowance due to the realization of foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
the permanent differences in relate to interest expense on a million note payable to hamilton sundstrand that was not deductible for tax purposes by us and interest income that was recognized for tax purposes on the million notes payable from six of our senior officers  but not recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  goodwill amortization related to the purchase transactions increased the effective tax rate because the amortization was not deductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources in  we generated approximately million from operating activities 
this resulted from our net loss of million offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development of million  deferred compensation amortization of  inventory provisions of  and a net positive cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of million 
a large portion of cash from operations resulted from a lowering of the inventory levels at our newly acquired companies 
the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was mainly due to the receipt of tax refunds of million 
in  we used approximately million in investing activities  which consisted mainly of our acquisitions of ghz and msc rf  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities of million 
the acquisition of ghz consumed million of cash and direct costs  net of cash acquired of  the ghz assets acquired included approximately  in cash and million in marketable securities 
in addition we issued apt stock and options valued at million 
we also purchased million of equipment during the period 
the acquisition of msc rf consumed million of cash  including direct costs of  in  we generated approximately  from financing activities  which primarily consisted of net proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
as of december   apt had million in working capital 
our trade accounts receivable balance was million reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days  compared to trade accounts receivable of million at december   reflecting a days sales outstanding ratio of days 
trade accounts receivable balances have increased due to improved sales and the additional companies acquired 
our inventory balance was million reflecting inventory turns of times per year  compared to an inventory balance of million at december   reflecting inventory turns of times per year 
inventory balances have increased due to the companies acquired during inventory turns decreased over the prior year average as a result of the decline in sales levels experienced in the second half of and into the calculations above are based on yearly average balances of trade accounts receivable and inventory  adjusted to include the related opening balances from our acquisitions 
apt currently expects to fund expenditures for capital requirements as well as liquidity needs from a combination of available cash balances  internally generated funds and financing arrangements if needed 
as of december   apt had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
apt s investment policy is to invest in short term  high grade liquid investments with the goal of capital preservation 
apt s ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be affected by market conditions as well as other risk factors as described below 
we expect from time to time to evaluate potential acquisitions and equity investments complementary to our market strategy 
to the extent we pursue such transactions  we could require additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities or to fund our working capital requirements in the event of an industry downturn or an unexpected adverse change in our business operations 
to the extent we require additional capital we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
as of december   principal commitments consisted of obligations under operating leases as outlined in part i  item  properties and in footnote eight to the financial statements 
in addition we had certain commitments with vendors as outlined in footnote to the financial statements 
at december  we had capital expenditure commitments of approximately  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of the new rule is not expected to have a material impact on the company s statements of position  operations or cash flows 
in november   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and requires that they be recorded at fair value 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are to be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of the new rule is not expected to have a material impact on the company s statements of position  operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued the sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the amendments to sfas regarding disclosure are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company applies apb in accounting for its employee stock option plan 
risk factors affecting business and results of operations this report contains statements which  to the extent that they do not recite historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the words believe  expect  estimate  may  will  could  plan or continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking information involves important risks and uncertainties that could materially alter results in the future from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  us 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to those listed in this report 
we caution you that such forward looking statements are only predictions and actual events or results may differ materially 
in evaluating such statements  you should specifically consider the various factors which could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including the factors that we discuss below 
we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report  to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
the semiconductor industry is very cyclical  and an industry downturn would reduce our revenues 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant price erosion  periods of over capacity and production shortages  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
the semiconductor industry has from time to time experienced depressed business conditions 
in the past  business conditions in this industry have rapidly changed from periods of strong demand to periods of weak demand 
any future downturn in the industry could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions or other factors 
we have historically experienced fluctuations in our operating results and expect these fluctuations to continue  which may cause our common stock price to decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect our net sales  gross margins and operating results 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to expand manufacturing output to meet increasing demand  the timing and extent of our research and development expenses  and fluctuations in manufacturing yields 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new proprietary products with higher margins or reduce manufacturing costs to offset anticipated decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be harmed 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
because most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of fixed costs in the semiconductor industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we may experience material adverse fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in future periods 
if we cannot introduce new products on a timely basis  our financial results may suffer 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions 
our success depends upon our ability to develop improved power semiconductors for new and existing markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner  and to have these products gain market acceptance 
the development of new power semiconductors is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in developing and introducing new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion of design and testing of new products  achievement of acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers 
we cannot assure you we will be able to meet these challenges or adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
due to the complexity and variety of power semiconductors  the limited number of qualified development engineers and the limited effectiveness of computer aided design systems in the design of such circuits  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that any products introduced by us will be adopted by existing or potential customers  or that any products initially accepted by our customers will become industry standard products 
our failure to develop and introduce new products successfully could significantly harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer 
our results of operations are also dependent on our ability to optimize the mix between sales of relatively higher margin but lower volume products and relatively higher volume but lower margin products 
in order to improve our margins  sales of higher margin products must in the future represent a greater percentage of our net sales  requiring us to develop  introduce and market new proprietary products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing new proprietary products with the features and functionality that customers in our key markets will demand 
disruption  termination or reduction in the functions performed by our key subcontractors could reduce our sales 
we are increasingly more reliant on third party subcontractors in europe and asia for manufacturing  assembly and packaging of most of our products 
we have entered into a wafer foundry agreement with infineon technologies  an outside foundry located in europe  which currently provides a significant percentage of our wafers 
in addition  during we signed a wafer foundry agreement with episil technologies  located in taiwan 
our agreement with infineon extends indefinitely and requires a two year notice of termination 
our agreement with episil technologies extends indefinitely and requires a one year notice of termination 
we also rely on agreements with team pacific and psi technologies  subcontractors in the philippines  for assembly and packaging of most of our switching power semiconductor products 
our agreement with team pacific extends through january  and requires team pacific to assemble all products we send them  based on rolling periodic forecasts 
our agreement with psi technologies extends through december  in addition  we rely on subcontractor services from vertek international  inc in mexico and semiconductor assembler manufacturer  sdn 
bhd 
sam in malaysia for assembly and packaging of our rf and microwave products 
the agreements with vertek and sam are governed by purchase orders which are periodically renewed 
disruption or termination of these arrangements could harm our business and operating results 
political instability  labor disputes or natural disasters could disrupt the operations of our subcontractors 
if any of our subcontractors experience financial  operational  production or quality assurance difficulties resulting in a reduction or interruption in supply to us  our operating results would suffer until alternate subcontractors  if any  become available 
our subcontractors may not be able to maintain the technological capability to meet our future needs 
in addition  our subcontractors also manufacture and package products for our competitors  and there is a risk that our subcontractors could allocate less of their production capacity and resources to our needs 
if our manufacturing processes become obsolete  our margins and profitability will be harmed 
semiconductor design and process methodologies are subject to rapid technological change  requiring large expenditures for research and development in order to improve product performance and increase manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that our current process technology will not become obsolete 
if we are unable to develop or obtain access to advanced silicon wafer processing technologies as they become needed  our future operating results will suffer 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to obtain or maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
we cannot assure you that any patent owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
moreover  the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot assure you that our current patents are or any new patents that may be issued will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage to us 
we may also become subject to or initiate interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources and could harm our financial results 
in addition  we have licensed a portion of our intellectual property rights to european and japanese entities and entered into a joint venture and licensing and technology transfer agreement in china 
the china agreement was subsequently terminated effective in february of intellectual property law and practice differs in foreign jurisdictions  and it may prove difficult for us to protect our rights in certain foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that our licensing and other arrangements with foreign entities will not result in infringements on our proprietary rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  either in the us or abroad  we could face increased competition in the market for our products and technologies  which could negatively affect our sales and ability to expand our business 
we may become involved in costly and lengthy patent infringement or intellectual property litigation  which could harm our business 
the semiconductor industry in general is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
protecting our proprietary rights may require us to defend claims of intellectual property infringement by our competitors 
if any such infringements arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot be certain that licenses would be available under reasonable terms or that we could successfully develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
moreover  such efforts would likely be time consuming and divert management attention and resources 
our future involvement in patent infringement or intellectual property litigation could harm our operating results and financial condition 
although none of our patents or intellectual property rights has been successfully challenged to date  we have been sued by ixys corporation for purportedly infringing two of its patents covering power mosfets 
we have denied infringement of the ixys patents and have asserted affirmative defenses to our claims 
trial is scheduled to commence on may  we intend to contest ixys s claims vigorously but the outcome of this litigation remains uncertain 
no assurance can be provided that a court ruling unfavorable to apt would not materially harm our business 
in addition  the length of time and legal fees associated with the patent litigation with ixys may be significant 
additionally  in the future we could be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of other third parties 
we also have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual rights by our products 
no assurance can be provided that any future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or that assertions of infringement if proven to be true will not harm our business 
strong competition in the power semiconductor market may reduce the demand for our products or the prices of our products  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
the power semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
significant competitive factors in the power semiconductor market include product features and performance  product quality  product reliability  technical knowledge  breadth of product line  competitive pricing  and customer service and support 
because the market for power semiconductors is diverse and highly fragmented  we encounter different competitors in our various product markets 
our principal competitors in one or more of our product areas include fairchild semiconductor  international rectifier  ixys  ma com  motorola  philips and st microelectronics 
many of our competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do 
we expect intensified competition from existing power semiconductor suppliers and the possible entry of new competitors 
increased competition could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our financial condition or our operating results 
competitive pressures could reduce market acceptance of our products and result in price reductions and increases in expenses that could harm our business and our financial condition 
our financial results would be harmed if we were to lose one of our major customers or key distributors 
several of our major customers account for a significant portion of our net sales each year 
during  our top five customers accounted for approximately of our net sales  and one distributor  richardson electronics ltd  accounted for of our net sales 
revenues from advanced energy industries  inc represented of net revenues in if we lost richardson electronics ltd or one of our other major customers  or if one of them reduced or canceled significant orders  our net income and operating results could be harmed 
richardson electronics ltd serves as a significant distributor of our products 
if this relationship were discontinued  or if richardson electronics ltd should fail to provide adequate service to our customers  we could lose sales and our operating results would suffer 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
we have at times experienced periods of rapid revenue growth  and we anticipate future growth if demand increases in the markets for our products 
to manage this growth successfully  we will need to manage increased production requirements  attract  retain and train new employees and management  improve our operational and administrative systems  and manage multiple relationships with customers and suppliers 
we may be unable to accomplish any of these requirements  and our failure to do so would harm our operating results 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate acquisition successfully into our business 
we have made two acquisitions since we became a public company in august of  and we plan to pursue additional acquisitions of related businesses 
the expense incurred in consummating the future acquisition of related businesses  or our failure to integrate such businesses successfully into our existing businesses  could result in our company incurring unanticipated expenses and losses 
in addition  we may not be able to identify or finance additional acquisitions or realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions we do complete 
in the event of future acquisitions  we could use a significant portion of our available cash  issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  or assume contingent liabilities 
should we successfully acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with acquisitions include difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or joint venture  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
our ability to successfully manage these risks would be limited by the small size of our management team 
our business is subject to risks associated with operations in foreign countries 
in  approximately of our revenues were from sales to customers located outside of the us we are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  currency fluctuations and difficulties in staffing and management of overseas operations 
in addition  we have supply agreements  assembly agreements  and other relationships with foreign companies that are subject to similar risks 
failure to attract and retain key technical and management personnel could harm our operating results 
our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  particularly our development engineers  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly experienced development engineers  systems applications engineers and sales managers 
there is intense competition for the services of development engineers in our industry 
the loss of the services of one or more of our development engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for such personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could harm our business 
we do not currently carry life insurance payable to apt with respect to any of our employees 
our products are complex and could contain defects  which could reduce sales of those products or result in claims against us 
we develop complex and evolving products 
despite testing by us and our customers  defects or other performance problems may be found in existing or new products 
this could result in delay in recognition or loss of revenues  loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
these defects may also cause us to incur significant warranty  support and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and harm our relationships with our customers 
any defects or other problems with our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers who could seek damages from us for their losses 
even an unsuccessful product liability claim would likely be time consuming and costly to defend 
interruptions in wafer production may harm our operating results 
any prolonged inability to utilize our bend  oregon foundry or third party foundries as a result of fire  natural disaster or otherwise would harm our financial condition and cause our operating results to suffer 
if we are not able to obtain additional foundry capacity as required  our relationships with our customers would be harmed and our sales would likely be reduced 
we may not be able to make arrangements for additional foundry capacity in a timely fashion or at all  and such arrangements  if any  may not be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  if we are able to secure additional foundry capacity  we may be obligated to utilize all of that capacity or incur penalties 
these penalties may be expensive and could harm our operating results 
we depend on the availability of raw materials to manufacture our products  and a disruption in supply could harm our operating results 
we rely on raw materials to manufacture our products  including silicon  various chemicals  gases and compounds 
in particular  we obtain silicon wafers and some packages through limited sources of supply  and in the event of a shortage  we may be forced to locate alternative sources and be forced to pay higher prices 
a severe shortage or an increase in the price of silicon wafers or some packages may harm our gross margins and our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis  if at all 
our business may be adversely effected by acts of terrorism 
acts of terrorism could interrupt or restrict our business in several ways 
we rely extensively on the use of air transportation to move our inventory to and from our vendors and to ship finished products to our customers 
if terrorist acts cause air transportation to be grounded or interrupted  our business would be adversely effected 
in addition  acts of terrorism could cause existing export regulations to be changed  which could limit the extent to which we are allowed to export our products 
to the extent that acts of terrorism also reduce customer confidence and create general economic weakness  our business would also be adversely effected 
our manufacturing operations involve hazardous substances  and the costs of complying with applicable environmental laws could harm our financial results 
our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the management  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and the emission and discharge of pollutants into the air  water and soil 
in the conduct of our manufacturing operations  we have handled and do handle materials that are considered hazardous  toxic or volatile under federal  state and local laws 
the risk of accidental release of such materials cannot be completely eliminated  and if such an accidental release occurs  we could be held financially responsible for clean up costs and other consequences of the release 
in addition  if environmental laws become more stringent over time  or existing laws are more stringently enforced  we could incur greater compliance costs and be subject to increased risks and penalties for violations 
we could be held liable for significant damages for violating environmental laws and could lose certain licenses or permits  which could harm our financial results 
an accident at our manufacturing facility could cause serious damage for which we could be responsible 
our manufacturing operations involve high voltage equipment  explosive gases and hazardous chemicals 
an accident at our manufacturing facility could result in serious personal injury or property damage for which we could be held financially responsible 
any financial obligation in excess of available insurance could harm our financial results 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in the control of our company 
the authorization of undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of apt 
these and other provisions in our charter may defer hostile takeovers or delay changes in control or management  which could reduce our stock price 
also  there are provisions of delaware law that may have similar effects 
six members of management  as a group  own a significant interest in our common stock 
six members of our senior management own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock  after the issuance of million shares for the acquisition of ghz technology inc as a result  these members of management exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval 
the concentrated holdings of management may result in a delay of  or serve as a deterrent to  possible changes in control of apt  which may reduce the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our cash equivalents  and the high quality and conservative nature of our long term investments  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
currently less than of our sales are transacted in local currencies  primarily euros 
as a result  our international results of operations have limited exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge against foreign currency rate fluctuations 
most of our export sales and sales by apt europe are in us dollars  and most of our foreign currency sales are from operations with significant expenses in the same currency 
as a result  gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to our consolidated results of operations
