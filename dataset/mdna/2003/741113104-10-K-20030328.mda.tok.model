critical accounting policies and estimates general presstek s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  presstek evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  and litigation 
presstek bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our financial statements 
revenue recognition presstek recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

under sab no 
 revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we record revenue for product sales net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return 
revenue and related royalties for products sold where installation is not required is recorded at the time of shipment 
revenue for products that require installation  for which the installation is not deemed inconsequential  is recognized upon completion of installation and customer acceptance 
revenue related to service maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the duration of the particular contract 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue otherwise earned 
deferred revenue includes certain customer advances received as a result of our distribution agreements 
this revenue is recognized as product is shipped or services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts presstek evaluates its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific customer circumstances and on its historical rate of write offs 
we 
table of contents include any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible  along with a general reserve  in an overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate  however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance 
product warranties presstek warrants its products against defects in material and workmanship for various periods  determined by the product  generally from a period of ninety days to a period of one year from the date of installation 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as intangible assets and property and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets will be written down to fair value 
results of operations fiscal versus fiscal revenue our revenue for fiscal was negatively impacted by the global economic slowdown  which continued in fiscal  and specifically by the weakness in the graphic arts industry 
this economic slowdown has led to a reduction in spending for capital equipment  such as our ctp equipment and di presses 
revenue for fiscal of million consisted of product sales  customer support revenue  royalties and license fees 
revenue for fiscal decreased million or as compared to million for fiscal revenue generated for fiscal relates primarily to the digital imaging products segment  as the external revenue generated by the lasertel segment was not material 
in fiscal the lasertel segment recorded a million revenue reversal  which related to a sale recorded in fiscal the sale was reversed as a result of a customer return related to product quality 
other external revenue generated by the lasertel segment in fiscal was not material 
product sales  including equipment and consumables  were million for fiscal  a decrease of million or  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in product sales was due primarily to volume decreases of docucolor di press shipments to xerox 
product sales also decreased due to volume and price decreases of direct imaging kits sold to heidelberg for use in the quickmaster di and to ryobi for use in the ryobi di 
these decreases were partially offset by volume increases of karat press shipments to kba  as well as volume increases in our consumable products 

table of contents the revenue generated from the sale of consumable products was million for fiscal  an increase of million or  as compared to million for fiscal this increase in consumable revenue is primarily the result of an increase in the installed base of equipment using our proprietary consumable products 
consumable product revenue includes sales under the company s agreements with heidelberg and its distributors of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in march  we expanded the product offerings to select dealers in our distribution channel in europe to include the sale of quickmaster di consumables 
in connection with this offering  we reduced pricing on our full line of spooled consumables distributed through this dealer channel up to 
this new pricing may reduce the revenue generated by presstek from its spooled consumable products up to million in fiscal while the expected lost revenues resulting from the price reduction may be offset by increased revenues from spooled consumables sales derived from additional presses installed and increased usage of spooled consumables  there can be no assurance that this expected lost revenue will be offset 
in addition  market conditions may require us to expand the regions in which we offer reduced prices  or to further reduce our spooled consumable prices  which could further reduce our revenues in and beyond 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
revenue generated from services related to customer support  including installation and service contract revenue  was million or of revenue for fiscal  an increase of million  as compared to  for fiscal royalties and license fees for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or  as compared to royalties and license fees of million for fiscal royalties decreased million or for fiscal  compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased shipments to heidelberg of direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di 
licenses and fees decreased  comparing fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of the one time settlement fee received in fiscal in connection with the settlement of our outstanding arbitration proceedings with heidelberg  while no such fees were received in in connection with the settlement of our outstanding arbitration proceedings with heidelberg  we agreed to reduce the royalty payable by heidelberg for imaging kits delivered in connection with the heidelberg quickmaster di by approximately  per kit 
this reduced royalty rate is effective for imaging kits ordered and delivered after may  revenue generated under the company s agreements with heidelberg and its distributors was million for fiscal  a decrease of million or  as compared to million for fiscal revenue from heidelberg represented and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
we currently have orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di for delivery through april heidelberg has indicated  as a result of the global economic slowdown  that it has an inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements for six months 
we believe that orders for direct imaging kits will resume sometime in the second half of fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that any orders will be received 
we have recently learned that heidelberg plans to introduce a competitive plate product as an alternative to our pearldry for the quickmaster di beginning in the second quarter of fiscal while it is too early to estimate the impact this plate may have on presstek s business  the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg 
this could also lead to downward pricing pressure for our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in march  we terminated our supply and distribution agreement with xerox for docucolor di presses 
xerox will no longer sell the docucolor di  the docucolor di and the docucolor di presses and related consumables 
we recorded an adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this termination  see cost of products sold below 
the revenue generated from 
table of contents the sale of these presses was not material in fiscal  and as a result  the termination of this agreement is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
cost of products sold cost of products sold consists of the costs of material  labor and overhead  shipping and handling costs and warranty expenses 
cost of products sold for the digital imaging products segment was million or of revenue for fiscal  a decrease of million or as compared to million or of revenue for fiscal included in cost of products sold for the digital imaging products segment for fiscal is a charge of million adjusted from million to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of the termination of the supply and distribution agreement with xerox 
the charge included million for inventory write downs and million adjusted from million to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for other charges associated with discontinued programs recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as part of the june restructuring 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue for the digital imaging products segment was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal excluding the inventory write downs and other charges for discontinued programs of million discussed above  the cost of products sold would have been million as opposed to million 
as a result  gross margin for the digital imaging products segment would have been as opposed to for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the gross margin increase for fiscal  excluding the write downs of million discussed above  was primarily the result of yield improvements related to the manufacturing of our consumable products  and a favorable product mix 
in fiscal and  we recorded net warranty costs of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the dimension platesetter product 
we believe these warranty costs will be reduced in fiscal as savings related to product quality programs initiated in are realized 
there can be no assurance  however  that these programs will result in reduced warranty costs 
cost of products sold for the lasertel segment was million for fiscal  a decrease of million or  as compared to million for fiscal included in cost of products sold for the lasertel segment for fiscal is a charge of  related to inventory write downs associated with the discontinued programs undertaken as part of the june restructuring 
the decrease in manufacturing costs was primarily the result of reduced salaries and benefits related to head count reductions in the first six months of fiscal research and product development research and product development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel  parts and supplies  and contracted services required to conduct our equipment  consumables and high powered laser diode product development efforts 
research and product development expenses for the digital imaging products segment were million or of revenue  a decrease of million  as compared to million or of revenue for fiscal this decrease relates primarily to a reduction in the number of development programs in fiscal  and resulted in reduced salaries as a result of head count reductions in the first six months of fiscal  as well as reduced professional and contracted services 
presstek s product development cycle centers around major industry trade shows  and as a result  our research and product development expenses vary in accordance with our product development cycle 
research and product development expenses for the lasertel segment were  for fiscal research and product development expenses for the lasertel segment were not material in fiscal

sales  marketing and customer support expenses for the digital imaging products segment were million or of revenue for fiscal  a decrease of million  as compared to million  or of fiscal revenue 
this decrease is primarily the result of focusing our business on the marketing and commercialization of our di technology  and resulted in reduced salaries and benefits and related travel costs  as a result of headcount reductions in the first six months of fiscal sales and marketing expenses for the lasertel segment were  for fiscal  a decrease of  as compared to  for fiscal this decrease relates primarily to reduced salaries and benefits and related travel expenses  as a result of head count reductions in the first six moths of fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel  and contracted professional services necessary to conduct our finance  information systems  human resources  and administrative activities 
general and administrative expenses for the digital imaging products segment were million or of revenue  a decrease of million  as compared to million or of revenue for fiscal this decrease relates primarily to decreases in legal fees as a result of settlement of our arbitration proceedings with heidelberg in july  and the court s rendering a decision in our patent litigation with creo in september also in  we recorded a million write off for prepayments made to adast  a supplier of b size sheet fed presses 
adast joined in a bankruptcy petition filed by its creditors in february and in february  the company reorganized under new ownership 
although the company has subsequently reorganized  we do not expect to be able to successfully recover any of these pre payments 
general and administrative expenses for the lasertel segment were million for fiscal  a decrease of million  as compared to million for fiscal this decrease relates primarily to reduced salaries and benefits and related travel expenses  as a result of head count reductions in the first six months of fiscal special charges and discontinued programs in the second quarter of fiscal  presstek initiated a process to evaluate its resources and strategically re focus the business 
during this process  we evaluated all aspects of the business  and concluded to reposition and rescale our resources 
as part of this exercise  we initiated various repositioning actions during the second quarter of fiscal these actions included the following i creation of market focused direct imaging di and computer to plate ctp product lines  ii creation of a new senior management organization  iii discontinuance of certain programs  and iv the consolidation of our hampshire drive research and development facility into the main executive drive facility in hudson  nh 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a charge of million to cost of products sold in the second quarter of fiscal  which included million for inventory write downs and million for other charges related to discontinued programs  million of which was recorded by the digital imaging products segment  and  by the lasertel segment 
in addition  the digital imaging products segment recorded special charges of million in the second quarter of fiscal the special charges included million related to severance and fringe benefit costs associated with the reduction of approximately employees  primarily in manufacturing and

working capital changes primarily included decreases in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  offset by decreases in accrued expenses of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is attributable to improved cash collections and the decrease in revenue 
the decrease in inventories is primarily as a result of inventory management programs initiated in fiscal net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended december  consisted primarily of additions to property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from the sale of equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  totaled  and consisted primarily of proceeds of million from borrowings under our lease line of credit facility  offset by payments on the mortgage term loans and the equipment lease line of credit facility of million  as well as payments on the revolving line of credit facility of million 
our long term debt consists of two mortgage term loans from citizens bank new hampshire citizens  and a lease line of credit facility from keybank national association keybank 
the first mortgage term loan is a ten year mortgage term loan from citizens in the amount of million and bears a fixed rate of interest of per year during the first five years  and a variable rate of interest at the libor rate plus  at december  for the remaining five years 
principal and interest payments during the first five years of the loan will be made in monthly installments of  during the remaining five years  principal and interest payments will be made on a monthly basis in the amount of one sixtieth of the outstanding principal amount as of the first day of the second five year period  plus accrued interest through the monthly payment date

all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest is due and payable on october  land and buildings with a cost and net book value of approximately million and million  respectively  secure the two mortgage term loans 
we also borrowed million against a million lease line of credit facility  which expired in april  from keybank pursuant to a loan agreement 
the million in borrowings is secured by equipment with a book value at december  of million 
the loan bears a variable rate of interest based upon the libor rate plus at december  or the prime rate at december   with a future fixed rate conversion provision 
principal and interest under the lease line are payable in monthly installments 
in addition to the mortgage term loans and the borrowings under the lease line of credit  we have a revolving line of credit loan with citizens  which expires in october under which we may borrow from citizens a maximum of million 
the revolving line of credit is subject to a borrowing base formula based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories  as defined by the loan agreement  and reduced by the amount of all letters of credit outstanding 
the revolving line of credit loan is secured by substantially all of the company s assets  with interest payable at the libor rate plus at december  
as of december   we had million available under the revolving line of credit loan  reduced by million outstanding under standby letters of credit 
under the terms of the mortgage term loans  the lease line of credit and the revolving line of credit agreements  we are required to meet various restrictive covenants on a quarterly and annual basis  including maximum funded debt to ebitda and minimum fixed charge coverage covenants 
at december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we have future contractual payments primarily related to debt  royalty obligations  executive contractual obligations and operating leases  from through the following table represents our future commitments at december  thereafter in thousands credit facilities royalty obligation executive contractual obligations lease agreements total contractual obligations our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal are approximately million  and primarily relate to the purchase of capital equipment to be used in the production of our di and ctp equipment and consumable products 
we have recently learned that heidelberg will market a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di  which is expected to be available beginning in the second quarter of fiscal while it is too early to estimate the impact this plate may have on presstek s business  the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg  and could lead to downward pricing pressure for our full line of spooled consumable products  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 

table of contents we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available under our revolving line of credit and lease line of credit should be sufficient to satisfy working capital requirements and capital expenditures through the term of our current loan agreement  which expires in october there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to renew our current loan agreement  will not require additional financing  or that such additional financing  if needed  will be available on acceptable terms 
effect of inflation inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a material impact on our operations 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions become realizable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards that may be utilized in any future period may be subject to certain limitations  based upon changes in the ownership of our common stock

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas in annual financial statements and requires disclosures in interim financial statements 
those disclosures are required regardless of the method being used to account for stock based employee compensation 
the amended and new disclosure requirements are effective for the fiscal year ending december  the adoption of the disclosure requirements of sfas will not have a material affect on our financial statements

we have a history of losses  could incur substantial losses in the future  and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred substantial net losses from continuing operations in four of the past five fiscal years 
we incurred net losses from continuing operations of approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we may need to 
table of contents generate significant increases in revenues to achieve and maintain profitability  and we may not be able to do so 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate  due to potential competitive pricing pressures  or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect or cannot be reduced in the event of lower revenues  our business will be materially adversely affected 
even if we achieve profitability in the future on a quarterly or annual basis  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability 
failure to become profitable within the time frame expected by investors or to sustain profitability may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are substantially dependent on heidelberg for a material portion of our revenue and the loss of heidelberg as a customer or a significant reduction in revenue from sales to heidelberg would adversely affect our business 
we have had an important long term relationship with heidelberg 
since entering into our strategic alliance with heidelberg  our sales of products to heidelberg have constituted a material portion of our total revenue 
for the fiscal year ended december   our sales to heidelberg accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
there can be no assurance that our relationship with heidelberg will continue 
the loss of heidelberg as a customer  or a material decrease in the revenue we receive from direct imaging kit sales or consumable sales to heidelberg would have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have recently learned that heidelberg has plans to offer a competitive plate product as an alternative to our pearldry for the quickmaster di 
we understand this product is expected to be available beginning in the second quarter of fiscal while it is too early to estimate the impact this plate may have on presstek s business  the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg  and could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have orders from heidelberg for direct imaging kits used in the quickmaster di for delivery through april heidelberg has recently indicated  as a result of the global economic slowdown  that it has an inventory of direct imaging kits on hand to support its production requirements for six months 
we believe that orders for direct imaging kits will resume sometime in the second half of fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that any orders will be received 
in july  we settled our outstanding arbitration proceedings with heidelberg 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  presstek and heidelberg agreed that the licensing arrangements for the heidelberg quickmaster di shall be non exclusive 
as a result of the recognition of the non exclusivity of the license  we agreed to reduce the royalty payable by heidelberg for imaging kits delivered in connection with the heidelberg quickmaster di by approximately  per kit 
this reduced royalty rate is effective for kits ordered and delivered after may  there can be no assurance that we will not have similar disputes with heidelberg in the future including any potential patent litigation  and likewise  there can be no assurance that any disputes that do arise will be resolved in our favor 
we are substantially dependent on our strategic alliances and manufacturing and distribution relationships to develop and grow our business and the loss or failure of one or more of our strategic partners could significantly harm our business 
our strategy to date has been  in part  to enter into strategic alliances with major companies in the graphic arts industry and other markets 
this strategy has included  among other things  licensing our intellectual property  developing specialized products based on our proprietary technologies and manufacturing imaging systems for inclusion in other manufacturers products 
our strategy has also involved identifying strategic manufacturing and distribution partners to aid in developing new market channels for our products 
this strategy led to the development of our relationship with heidelberg 
it also led to the development of relationships with other strategic partners  including kba  ryobi and kpg 
we are dependent on many of these partners for future sales of both existing and planned products 
this dependency means that the timetable for finalizing development  commercialization and distribution of both existing and planned products is dependent upon the needs and circumstances of our strategic partners 
we have experienced and will continue to experience technical difficulties from time to time  which may prevent us from meeting certain production and distribution targets 
any delay in meeting production and distribution targets with our strategic partners may harm our relationship with them and may cause them to terminate their relationship with us 
our strategic partners 
table of contents may not develop markets for our products at the pace or in the manner we expect  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
they may also terminate their relationship with us for circumstances beyond our control  including factors unique to their business or their business decisions 
in addition  we may mutually agree with one of our partners to terminate our relationship with them for a variety of reasons 
for example  in march  we agreed with xerox to terminate our supply and distribution agreement with them for docucolor di presses 
as a result  xerox will no longer sell the docucolor di  the docucolor di and the docucolor di presses and related consumables 
while we do not believe the termination of our relationship with xerox will have a material adverse impact on our business  we cannot assure you that the termination of any of our other relationships with our strategic partners will not have an adverse impact on our business 
we are also unable to control factors related to the business of our strategic partners 
as an example  in february  adast  a manufacturing partner of ours  announced that it had joined a bankruptcy petition filed by its creditors 
as a result of this development  we adjusted our fiscal fourth quarter net income and balance sheet to include an additional write off of approximately million to cover prepayments made to adast for work in progress 
there can be no assurance that similar events will not occur with our other strategic partners 
as a result of the uncertainties surrounding many of our strategic partners  there can be no assurance that our existing strategic relationships will prove successful 
there can be no assurance that our existing relationships with heidelberg  kba  ryobi  or kpg or any of our other strategic  manufacturing and distribution partners will be successful 
the loss of  heidelberg  kba  ryobi  kpg or other principal customers or strategic partners could have a materially adverse effect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
while we continue to explore possibilities for additional strategic relationships and alliances  there can be no assurance we will be successful in this regard 
our failure to develop new relationships and alliances could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are sometimes difficult to predict  have varied in the past  and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we typically realize a significant percentage of our revenues for a fiscal quarter in the third month of the quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results may be difficult to predict prior to the end of the quarter 
any inability to obtain sufficient orders or to fulfill shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of any particular quarter may cause the results for that quarter to fall short of our revenues targets 
in addition  we base our current and future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are largely fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations 
accordingly  a revenues shortfall in a particular quarter would have an adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 
in addition  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  without limitation changes in demand for our products and consumables  including seasonal differences  and changes in the mix of our products and consumables 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues 
our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our operating results 
customers view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  customers generally evaluate our products and determine their impact on existing infrastructure over a lengthy period of time 
our sales cycle has historically ranged from approximately one to six months based on the customer s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the customer is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays if the customer has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a customer s evaluation period 
larger customers may purchase our products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays 
table of contents in the recognition of our revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed to another quarter  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
we may not be able to increase revenues if we do not expand our sales and distribution channels 
we will need to expand our indirect global sales operations in order to increase market awareness and acceptance of our line of products and generate increased revenues 
we market and distribute our products indirectly through our global partner and distributor network 
we believe that our future success is dependent upon expansion of indirect global distribution channels  which will consist of relationships with a variety of dealers and distributors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our current relationship or establish relationships with additional distribution partners on a timely basis  or at all 
our distribution partners may not devote adequate resources to promoting or selling our line of products and may not be successful 
any failure to expand our indirect global distribution channel or increase the productivity of this distribution channel could result in lower than anticipated revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
in march  we expanded the product offerings to select dealers in our distribution channel in europe to include the sale of quickmaster di consumables 
in connection with this offering  we reduced pricing on our full line of spooled consumables distributed through this dealer channel up to 
this new pricing may reduce the revenue generated from sales of our spooled consumable products up to million in fiscal while the expected lost revenues resulting from the price reduction may be offset by increased revenues from spooled consumables sales derived from additional presses installed and increased usage of spooled consumables  there can be no assurance that this expected lost revenue will be offset 
in addition  market conditions may require us to expand the regions in which we offer reduced prices  or to further reduce our spooled consumable prices  which could further reduce our revenues in and beyond 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks associated with international sales 
we intend to expand our indirect global sales operations and enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
international sales are subject to a variety of risks  including difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels  in serving and supporting products sold outside the united states and in translating products and related materials into foreign languages 
international operations are also subject to difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  staffing and managing personnel and enforcing intellectual property rights 
other factors that can adversely affect international operations include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates  changes in import export duties and quotas  introduction of tariff or non tariff barriers and economic or political changes in international markets 
if our international sales increase  our revenues may also be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower levels of sales which typically occur during the summer months in europe and other parts of the world 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our inability to maintain an adequate supply of advanced laser diodes and other critical components could adversely affect us 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for critical components and our increased demand for these components may put strain on the ability of our third party suppliers to deliver critical components in a timely manner 
for example  our requirements for advanced technology laser diodes for use in products incorporating our di technology has increased and is expected to increase in the future 
although we have established lasertel to help us meet our demand for laser diodes  we are still dependent on other third party manufacturers for our supply of other necessary components 
if we are unable for any reason to secure an uninterrupted source of other critical components at prices acceptable to us  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that lasertel will be able to manufacture advanced laser diodes in quantities that will fulfill our future needs  or with manufacturing volumes or yields that will make our operation cost effective 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain 
table of contents alternative suppliers for our laser diodes or other critical components should our current supply channels prove ineffective 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may not be commercially successful and may not gain market acceptance 
achieving market acceptance for any products incorporating our technology requires substantial marketing and distribution efforts and expenditure of significant sums of money and allocation of significant resources  either by us  our strategic partners or both 
we may not have sufficient resources to do so 
additionally  there can be no assurance that products introduced by our strategic partners  such as the karat di presses  and the kpg di presses  or our product offerings such as our anthem plates  dimension and dimension platesetters  will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any of our other current products or any future products that we may develop or any future products produced by others that incorporate our technologies will achieve market acceptance or become commercially successful 
we recently announced beta testing of our new applause plate 
there can be no assurance that the beta testing of this plate will be successful  that the final product will be introduced in the time frame expected  or that it will achieve market acceptance or become commercially successful 
if our new product offerings do not achieve anticipated market acceptance  we may not achieve anticipated revenue 
recently introduced products that incorporate our technology may result in substantial support costs and warranty expenditures 
introducing new products carries substantial risk 
while we do substantial testing on our new products before introducing them to our customers  no amount of testing can replace or approximate actual field conditions at our customer locations 
as a result  when we introduce new products we can incur increased expenditures in ensuring that the new product meets and performs in accordance with its specifications 
we cannot  however  always estimate precisely the expected costs that may arise out of new product installations 
as an example of this  we incurred increased warranty and support costs in fiscal and due to unanticipated product performance issues associated with our new dimension product line 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur increased warranty  support and other costs associated with new product introductions in the future 
in addition  the occurrence of these expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet the demand for our products 
if demand for our products grows  our current manufacturing capabilities may be insufficient to meet this demand resulting in production delays and a failure to deliver products in a timely fashion 
we may be forced to seek alternative manufacturers for our products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully be able to do so 
as we introduce new products  we may face production and manufacturing delays due to technical and other unforeseen problems 
any manufacturing delay could have an adverse effect on our business and our revenue and may harm our relationships with our strategic partners 
if the united states and global economies continue to slow down  the demand for our products could decrease and our revenues might be hurt 
the demand for our products is affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  general economic conditions have recently deteriorated  and may further deteriorate due to events relating to the conflict between iraq and the united states  and may affect or delay the overall capital spending by businesses and consumers  particularly for capital equipment such as presses and consumables 
we believe that  concurrently with the economic slowdown in the us and abroad  and the decrease in capital equipment spending over the past three years  there has been a decrease in spending and spending projections on capital equipment which could impact the demand for our products 
if  as a result of general economic uncertainty or otherwise  companies reduce their product spending levels  such a decrease in spending could substantially reduce demand for our products  substantially harm our business  and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the expansion of lasertel into areas other than the production of laser diodes for our printing business may be unsuccessful 
lasertel  which was formed for the purpose of supplying us with laser diodes  has also explored other markets for its laser technology 
these efforts to develop other markets were scaled back  in part  in june  as we announced a repositioning of lasertel in order to reduce its 
table of contents costs and focus its efforts on supplying us with high quality laser diodes 
while the plans to market its laser products to the telecommunications industry were delayed  lasertel has developed laser products for the defense industry and has continued its plans to develop laser prototypes for qualification in the defense  industrial and medical industries 
there can be no assurance that these products or prototypes will gain acceptance in these industries and likewise  there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
our executive team has limited experience in the telecommunications  defense  industrial and medical industries and there can be no assurance that lasertel will be able to successfully exploit any opportunities that may arise 
lasertel may require additional working capital infusions from us  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our subsidiary  lasertel  was established to help us meet our demand for laser diodes 
lasertel has required and may continue to require a significant amount of capital investment by presstek in order to fund its operations 
for the fiscal year ended december   lasertel recorded a net loss of million 
lasertel continues to require us to advance cash and resources in order to ensure its continued operation 
lasertel s capital and working capital needs may exceed our ability to provide such funds  requiring us to borrow against our credit facilities or seek to obtain outside financing for lasertel s operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success is dependent on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
our future success will depend  in large part  upon our intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  proprietary know how  source codes and continuing technological innovation 
we have been issued a number of us and foreign patents and we intend to register for additional patents where we deem appropriate 
we also hold seven registered trademarks and we may register additional trademarks where we deem appropriate 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the issuance of any additional patents or trademarks or the breadth or degree of protection that our patents  trademarks or copyrights may afford us 
the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not adequately prevent misappropriation or ensure that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
further  the laws of certain territories in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
there is rapid technological development in the electronic image reproduction industries  resulting in extensive patent filings and a rapid rate of issuance of new patents 
although we believe that our technology has been independently developed and that the products we market do not infringe the patents or violate other proprietary rights of others  it is possible that such infringement of existing or future patents or violation of proprietary rights may occur 
in this regard  third parties may in the future assert claims against us concerning our existing products or with respect to future products under development by us 
in such event  we may be required to modify our product designs or obtain a license 
no assurance can be given that we would be able to do so in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions or even at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  we have agreements with several of our strategic partners which require us to indemnify the strategic partner from claims made by third parties against our intellectual property  and to defend the validity of the patents or otherwise ensure the technology s availability to the strategic partner 
an indemnification claim under any such agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may take legal action to determine the validity and scope of third party rights or to defend against any allegations of infringement 
in the course of pursuing or defending any of these actions we could incur significant costs and diversion of our resources 
due to the competitive nature of our industry  it is unlikely that we could increase our product prices to cover such costs 
there can be no assurance that we will have the financial or other resources necessary to successfully defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
moreover  we may be unable  for financial or other reasons  to enforce our rights under any patents we may own 
as an example of the cost and uncertainty of patent litigation  in august creo filed an action in the united states district court for the district of delaware against us seeking a declaration that creo s products do not and will not infringe any valid and enforceable claims of any of our 
table of contents patents in question 
we counter claimed against creo for patent infringement of certain of our patents 
the matter went to trial in june and in september  the court affirmed the validity and enforceability of our on press imaging patents  but held that the current creo dop system did not infringe on our patents 
creo appealed the court s decision that our patents were valid and enforceable  and we cross appealed the finding of non infringement by the current creo dop system 
on september   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s decision that our patents are valid and enforceable  but that they are not infringed by the current creo dop system 
we incurred higher than expected legal expenses in fiscal and fiscal due to this litigation 
any similar litigation in the future is expected to be costly  yield uncertain results and could have an adverse impact on our business  result of operations or financial condition 
we also rely on proprietary know how and employ various methods to protect the source codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation relating to our proprietary software and laser diode technology 
however  such methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such know how or obtain access to our know how or software codes  concepts  trade secrets  ideas and documentation 
although we have and expect to have confidentiality agreements with our employees and appropriate vendors  there can be no assurance  however  that such arrangements will adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we face substantial competition in the sale of our products 
we compete with manufacturers of conventional presses and products utilizing existing plate making technology  as well as presses and other products utilizing new technologies  including other types of direct to plate solutions such as companies that employ electrophotography as their imaging technology 
canon inc  hewlett packard company  heidelberg and xerox corporation are companies that have introduced color electrophotographic copier products 
various companies are marketing product versions manufactured by these companies 
we are also aware that there is a direction in the graphic arts industry to create stand alone computer to plate imaging devices for single and multi color applications 
most of the major corporations in the graphic arts industry have developed and or are developing and marketing off press computer to plate imaging systems 
to date  devices manufactured by our competitors  for the most part  utilize printing plates that require a post imaging photochemical developing step  and in some cases  also require a heating process 
potential competitors in this area include  among others  agfa gevaert nv  dai nippon screen manufacturing ltd  heidelberg and creo 
we also anticipate competition from printing plate manufacturing companies that manufacture  or have the potential to manufacture digital thermal plates 
these companies include agfa gevaert nv  kpg and fuji photo film co  ltd 
we also learned recently that heidelberg intends to market a competitive plate product as an alternative to presstek s pearldry for the quickmaster di 
we understand this new plate is expected to be available in the second quarter of fiscal while it is too early to estimate the impact this plate may have on presstek s business  the introduction of a competitive plate could reduce the revenue generated by presstek under its relationship with heidelberg  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
products incorporating our technologies can also be expected to face competition from conventional methods of printing and creating printing plates 
most of the companies marketing competitive products or with the potential to do so are well established  have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than us and have established reputations for success in the development  sale and service of products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 
while we believe we have strong intellectual property protection covering many of our technologies  there is no assurance that the breadth or degree of such protection will be sufficient to prohibit or otherwise delay the introduction of competitive products or technologies 
the introduction of competitive products and technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may not be able to adequately respond to changes in technology affecting the printing industry 
our continuing product development efforts have focused on refining and improving the performance of our pearl and di technology and our consumables and we anticipate that we will continue to do so 
the printing and publishing industry has been characterized in recent years by rapid and significant technological changes and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants could introduce new or enhanced products with features  which render our technologies  or products incorporating our technologies  obsolete or less marketable 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use leading technologies effectively  continue to develop our technical expertise and patented position  enhance our current products and develop new products that meet changing customer needs  time new product introductions in a way that minimizes the impact of customers delaying purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases  adjust the prices of our existing products to increase customer demand  successfully advertise and market our products  and influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we must respond to changing technology and industry standards in a timely and cost effective manner 
we may not be successful in effectively using new technologies  developing new products or enhancing our existing products and technology on a timely basis 
our new technologies or enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
our pursuit of new technology may require substantial time and expense 
we may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change 
these licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept 
finally  we may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge 
ongoing litigation could have an adverse impact on our business 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we may be subject to certain lawsuits 
our discontinued subsidiary  delta v  is currently a defendant in a lawsuit commenced by ppg  inc claiming that equipment sold by delta v did not meet certain product specifications 
although we intend to continue to vigorously defend this action  we could be adversely affected if the plaintiff were to prevail on its damage claim  which is in excess of million 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this action  or any other litigation of which we may become a party from time to time 
any adverse result in this litigation or any other litigation of which we may become a party from time to time may  have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss or unavailability of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of presstek is largely dependent on the personal efforts of our senior management team 
we have entered into an employment agreement with ed marino  our president and chief executive officer  and moosa e 
moosa  our chief financial officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of mr 
marino or mr 
moosa could have an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
in january  richard a 
williams  one of our founders  announced his retirement as chief scientific officer 
while he will continue to serve as chairman of the board  the loss of mr 
williams may have an adverse impact on our business 
our success may also be dependent on our ability to hire and retain additional qualified engineering  technical  sales  marketing and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel 
our stock price has been and could continue to be extremely volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations 
the securities markets have experienced  and are likely to experience in the future  significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect 
table of contents the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements by us or other industry participants  changes in national or regional economic conditions  changes in securities analysts estimates for us  our competitors or our industry or our failure to meet analysts expectations  and general market conditions 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market in particular  have experienced large price and volume fluctuations 
these market factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
certain factors may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock 
as of march   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding 
approximately  of our shares are currently freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of all of the remaining shares are eligible for sale  subject  in some cases  to affiliate and other restrictions under rule of the securities act of the sale of a significant number of these shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
there are currently outstanding options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at prices ranging from per share 
substantially all of these shares have been registered for resale and may be sold  subject  in some cases  to volume and other limitations under rule of the securities act of to the extent they are exercised or converted  the percentage ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted and our stock price could be adversely affected 
this could also adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional equity capital in the future  since the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in the outstanding options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities 
the majority of our long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments  or variable rate instruments with fixed rate conversion provisions 
we do not enter into interest rate swap agreements or other speculative or leveraged transactions 
we currently have no material exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk as substantially all of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
some of our customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states  however 
as a result  these customers and strategic partners are themselves subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the united states dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  some of our suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency versus that of the united states dollar could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
