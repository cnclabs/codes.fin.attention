item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see cautionary statements 
general we provide marine construction services to the offshore oil and gas industry in the us gulf of mexico  latin america  southeast asia and west africa 
our marine fleet consists of thirteen vessels  twelve of which are currently operational 
the primary services we provide include installing pipelines  providing pipebury  hook up and commissioning services  installing production platforms and other structures  disassembling and salvaging production platforms and other structures  and performing pipe spooling services 
the demand for offshore construction services depends largely on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for developmental construction 
these expenditures are influenced by the price of oil and gas and industry perception of future prices  the ability of the oil and gas industry to access capital  expectations about future demand and prices  the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and abroad  discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas  local and international political and economic conditions  governmental regulations  and the availability and cost of capital 
historically  oil and gas prices and the level of exploration and development activity have fluctuated substantially  impacting the demand for pipeline and marine construction services 
factors affecting our profitability include competition  equipment and labor productivity  contract estimating  weather conditions and other risks inherent in marine construction 
the marine construction industry in the us gulf of mexico is highly seasonal as a result of weather conditions with the greatest demand for these services occurring during the second and third calendar quarters of the year 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management must apply significant judgments in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors  that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management s understanding of our business  expected rates of business and operational change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
among the most subjective judgments employed in the preparation of these financial statements are estimates of expected costs to complete construction projects  the collectibility of contract receivables and claims  the fair value of salvage inventory  the depreciable lives of and future cash flows to be provided by our equipment  the period and extent of maintenance and repairs for drydocking activity and certain judgments regarding the nature of income and expenditures for tax purposes 
we review all significant estimates on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to publication of our financial statements 
adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not previously available 
because of the inherent uncertainties in this process  actual future results could differ from those expected at the reporting date 
we consider certain accounting policies to be critical policies due to the significant judgments  estimation processes and uncertainties involved for each in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition contract revenues for construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion for each contract 
this percentage is applied to the estimated revenue at completion to calculate revenues earned to date 
we consider the percentage of completion method to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from claims and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
revenue also includes amounts earned upon the completion of salvage services 
revenues from salvage projects include non cash values assigned to structures that are received from time to time as partial consideration 
cost recognition costs of contract revenues include all direct material and labor costs and certain indirect costs  such as supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation  which are allocated to contracts based on asset utilization 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
accounts receivable we have significant investments in billed and unbilled receivables as of december  we have historically not experienced any significant losses on receivables  but significant losses could be material to our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had million in contract receivables and million in costs in excess of billings from pemex  including million in claims related to weather and other delays  totaling million 
we believe our receivables are realizable  however  any changes will be recognized in the period in which they are determined 
property and equipment we use the units of production method to calculate depreciation on our major barges and vessels to accurately reflect the wear and tear of normal use 
the annual depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than of annual straight line depreciation  and the cumulative depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than of cumulative straight line depreciation 
the useful lives of our major barges and vessels range from years to years 
major additions and improvements to barges  boats and related equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the vessel 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
when equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the cost of the equipment and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
based on our analysis of the estimated future cash flows for our long term assets  we recognized a million impairment loss related to the phoenix horizon under sfas no 
for the year ended december  our planned use of the phoenix horizon changed during the fourth quarter of based on capital requirements and the projected utilization of our operating fleet to meet current market demands  which we expect to continue for at least the first half of during the fourth quarter  management determined not to invest in the improvements required to place the phoenix horizon into service due to the availability of other operational assets to address current market demands 
no impairments were recognized for the years ended december  and other assets dry dock costs are direct costs associated with scheduled major maintenance on the marine construction vessels 
costs incurred in connection with dry dockings are deferred and amortized over the five year cycle to the next scheduled dry docking 
on june   the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
if adopted  we would be required to expense regulatory maintenance cost on our vessels as incurred 
we incurred and capitalized dry dock costs of million in  million in and million in as of december   deferred dry dock costs totaled million 
expensing dry dock costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly earnings as a substantial portion of our dry dock activities take place during the first and fourth quarters 
inventory inventory consists of production platforms and other marine structures received from time to time as partial consideration from salvage projects performed in the us gulf of mexico 
these structures are held for resale 
in and  we sold inventory structures for million and million with related cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
the inventory is valued at amounts not in excess of the fair value of services provided 
horizon assesses the net realizable value of its inventory items at each balance sheet date 
inventory is classified as long term due to the uncertain timing of the sale of inventory 
results of operations the discussion below describes our results of operations 
our results reflect the ongoing competitive nature of marine construction services in the us gulf of mexico 
our profit margins in the us gulf of mexico remained under competitive pressure during due to reduced industry demand for our services 
our work in international areas continued to grow in with the expansion of our operations into southeast asia and west africa 
we believe these international areas will provide opportunities for improved profit margins compared to current market conditions in the us gulf of mexico 
our profit margins were adversely impacted by weather conditions during the fourth quarter of we experienced lower margins on vessels operating in the northern us gulf of mexico because of downtime due to unusually adverse weather conditions during the fourth quarter of the inclement winter weather conditions in the northeastern united states affected our profitability related to the pipeline installation and burial project in long island sound even though that project remains on schedule 
we believe our expansion into southeast asia and west africa will provide a counter seasonal balance to the effect of adverse winter weather conditions in the us gulf of mexico and latin america 
during  we completed two projects for pemex utilizing the atlantic horizon  lone star horizon and pearl horizon 
we began another project for pemex in may which we completed during the first quarter of pemex accounted for of consolidated revenues for compared with for and for our receivables from pemex continue to impact our liquidity and operating cash flows 
as of december   we had million of pemex receivables  consisting of contract receivables of million and costs in excess of billings of million 
we follow the guidance of aicpa sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts relating to use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs and claim recognition for construction contracts 
contract revenue reflects the original contract price adjusted for agreed upon change orders and unapproved claims 
we recognize unapproved claims only when the collection is deemed probable and if the amount can be reasonably estimated for purposes of calculating total profit or loss on long term contracts 
we record revenue for claims to the extent of costs incurred and include no profit on claims recorded 
cumulative revenues recognized from through on all pemex projects in mexico total million  including million of claims made under three pemex contracts for extra work related to interferences  interruptions and other delays 
of the million of claims  million relates to our second major project for pemex  epc  which was completed during the fourth quarter of the remaining million of claims relates to two more recent projects for pemex 
unapproved claims related to the pemex projects arise primarily from client delays and changes in the initial scope of work 
a summary of the balance of claims remaining in costs in excess of billings related to the pemex projects are as follows in millions claims included in revenue claims included in revenue total claims claims billed to pemex claims included in costs in excess of billings as of december  subsequent to december   we have collected million of contract receivables related to the pemex projects 
during november  we engaged a consulting firm in mexico to assist us in the administration of the claims to be made against pemex 
after considering the time necessary for the consultants to comply with pemex s requirements and communication with new pemex management  we believe that it will take longer to process and collect these claims than previously expected 
we now expect to formally submit these claims in accordance with pemex s requirements through the second quarter of  with collections expected by the end of the third quarter of the unapproved claims we have included as revenue through december  are expected to be substantially less than the actual claims to be presented to pemex  and we believe we will collect more than the claim amounts recorded 
however  there is a risk that the unapproved claims we have recognized as revenue may not be collected in full 
should these unapproved claims become uncollectible based upon subsequent events  we will recognize a loss in our financial statements at that time 
there may be factors other than the submission  review and approval of our claims which are outside our control that may impact the ultimate collectibility of these amounts 
we have considered factors including changes that have occurred related to pemex employees involved in the project  the operating structure of pemex  and the political and economic conditions in mexico in assessing the collectibility of these amounts 
on september   the pipelay barge  lone star horizon  sustained electrical damage due to a fire while at anchor off ciudad del carmen  mexico 
repairs to the lone star horizon were completed during the fourth quarter of at a cost of million 
we maintain hull and machinery insurance to cover physical damage to our vessels 
this insurance coverage provides for both a million occurrence deductible and a million annual aggregate deductible 
during  we recorded this million loss as other expense  and we believe the insurance will cover the cost to repair the damage 
as of december   we included the million insurance claim in current assets 
we collected an initial reimbursement of million in february we completed the construction of a spooling facility at our marine base in port arthur  texas in the first quarter of the facility can be used to provide pipe spooling services to other contractors and to our joint venture with cal dive 
we successfully completed two spooling projects in and commenced a third spool job in december that was successfully completed in the first quarter of the joint venture  which has not commenced operations  was formed to charter from cal dive the intrepid  a foot dynamically positioned multi service vessel  with reel pipelaying equipment 
operations of the joint venture would be jointly managed and staffed 
if both cal dive and horizon decide to commence joint venture operations  we would be required to contribute approximately million for the design  construction and installation of reel pipelaying equipment on the intrepid that was completed in based on current market conditions  we do not know when  or if  the joint venture will become operational 
the brazos horizon arrived in nigerian waters in october  and began work on a major portion of chevron nigeria ltd 
s escravos offshore pipeline and structural installation two year program in february during  we successfully completed several structural projects in indonesian waters 
we completed a subcontract in for the installation and burial of a inch pipeline for totalfinaelf in indonesia utilizing the sea horizon for all aspects of the installation 
we will continue to pursue international construction projects in mexico  latin america  southeast asia and west africa 
we mobilized the gulf horizon to begin construction of a pipeline installation and burial project in long island sound  new york in may we were awarded the contract to install miles of inch diameter pipe to transport natural gas from northport  long island to hunts point  new york via the long island sound and east river 
preparations for the project included extensive environmental training of personnel 
the gulf horizon was upgraded for inclement weather conditions and for the addition of automatic welding equipment 
this pipeline installation also included the design  fabrication and use of a ton plow to bury the inch pipeline below the seabed and riverbed 
construction activities commenced in november  and we expect to substantially complete the project during the second quarter of as of march   our backlog totaled approximately million compared to our backlog at december  and of approximately million and million  respectively 
this change is attributable to work performed during that period 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations contract revenues contract revenues were million for  compared to million for revenues increased compared with last year 
our projects in mexico contributed approximately million in revenues during  compared with million during the decline in revenues from the projects in mexico was offset by revenues of million from the pipeline installation and burial project in long island sound and by revenues from other international projects 
revenues recognized in and included million and million  respectively  from salvage and installation projects in the us gulf of mexico 
of the million in revenues recognized in  approximately million represents values assigned to structures received as partial consideration for salvage projects performed 
no significant non cash consideration was received in gross profit gross profit was million of contract revenues for compared with gross profit of million of contract revenues for excluding the effect of the claims on the pemex projects for which revenues were recognized to the extent of actual costs incurred  gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for compared with for the decline was due to lower margins bid on jobs as a result of competitive market conditions 
in addition  unusually adverse weather conditions during the fourth quarter of  and resulting downtime and revenues recorded for such events  lowered the overall profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of contract revenues for  compared with million of contract revenues for the increase was primarily due to our international expansion and costs associated with our pemex claims 
impairment of property and equipment we recognized a million impairment loss related to the phoenix horizon under sfas no 
for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we would not invest in the improvements required to place the barge into service under the current market conditions 
the impairment loss was based upon the cost of the phoenix horizon in excess of its estimated fair value based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
no impairments were recognized for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
total outstanding debt was million at december  compared with million at december  the decrease in interest expense was due to lower average interest rates  lower average outstanding debt balances as a result of the april equity offering and an increase in interest capitalization in related to our increased capital spending 
interest income interest income includes interest from cash investments for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances for other income expense  net included in other income expense for is a million loss related to a fire on the lone star horizon  million of foreign currency loss due to activity denominated in mexican pesos and a decline of the mexican peso compared to the us dollar  and approximately  of miscellaneous expense 
included in other income expense for the year ended december  is  of other net expenses associated with foreign currency transaction losses and  of net expenses related to our cal dive joint venture 
we recognized  of equity losses related to the dsnd joint venture and  of revenue earned from billings to the dsnd joint venture for administrative services in the dsnd joint venture was dissolved in february income taxes benefit we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recorded a federal income tax benefit of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax loss of million for we recorded a federal income tax provision of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax income before extraordinary loss of million for the difference from the statutory rate is due to the application of the extraterritorial income exclusion for income earned primarily in mexico and parts of southeast asia 
the exclusion allows us to exclude a qualifying portion of income earned outside the united states for tax purposes 
the impact of this exclusion on future periods will vary depending upon the amount of qualifying income earned outside the united states and changes in tax rules 
extraordinary loss in march of  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  or per share diluted  net of taxes of million related to a penalty on the early extinguishment of debt 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had no such event in net income loss net loss was million  or per share diluted  for  compared to net income for of million  or per share diluted  which includes the effect of an extraordinary loss of million  or per share diluted  related to the early extinguishment of debt 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results of operations contract revenues contract revenues were million for compared with million for our revenues for increased compared with the same period last year  primarily due to our ongoing projects offshore mexico 
our two projects in mexico contributed approximately million in revenues during  as compared to million in revenues recognized in and  included million and million  respectively  from salvage and installation projects in the us gulf of mexico 
no significant non cash consideration was received in and gross profit gross profit was million of contract revenues for compared with gross profit of million of contract revenues for gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased due to lower margins previously bid on jobs as a result of the competitive market conditions in the us gulf of mexico 
in addition  weather and other delay related claims on the pemex projects  for which revenues recognized of million in approximate the actual costs incurred  lowered the overall profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million of contract revenues for compared with million of contract revenues for the increase is due to additional expenses associated with our international expansion 
the percentage decrease was primarily due to the increase in revenues with a lower corresponding increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in interest expense interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
interest expense for was million  net of million of capitalized interest 
the decrease in interest expense was due to both lower average interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our debt 
interest income interest income includes interest from cash investments for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances for other income expense  net included in other income expense for the year ended december  is  of other net expenses associated with foreign currency transaction losses and  of net expenses related to our cal dive joint venture

income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recorded a federal income tax provision of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax income of million for  excluding million of deferred tax benefit attributable to the extraordinary loss 
we recorded a federal income tax provision of million  at a net effective rate of on a pre tax income of million for  excluding million of deferred tax provisions attributable to the accounting change in the decrease in our effective tax rate is due to the effect of the application of the extraterritorial income exclusion in for income earned primarily in mexico from october  to december  the exclusion allows us to exclude a qualifying portion of income earned outside the united states for tax purposes 
the impact of this exclusion on future periods will vary depending upon the amount of qualifying income earned outside the united states and changes in tax rules 
extraordinary loss in march of  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  or per share diluted  net of taxes of million related to a penalty on the early extinguishment of debt 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income net income was million  or per share diluted  for  which includes the effect of an extraordinary loss of million  or per share diluted  related to the early extinguishment of debt 
net income for was million  or per share diluted  which includes the effect of a cumulative adjustment of million  or per share  related to a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources in april  we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering 
we received million after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses 
we used million to reduce indebtedness under our revolving credit facilities and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
our primary liquidity needs are to provide working capital to support our projects and other operations and to fund acquisitions and improvements to the fleet necessary to expand operations 
we had million of working capital at december   compared to million of working capital at december  the decrease in working capital was attributable to an increase in accounts payable and the use of funds for capital expenditures and to reduce of our long term debt 
our receivables from pemex continue to impact our liquidity and operating cash flows 
as of december   we had contract receivables of million and costs in excess of billings of million from pemex totaling million 
the significant delays between the completion of the work and when it is billed and collected are caused by pemex s rigid requirements on the submission  review and approval of invoices and documentation prior to their payment of contract claims and change orders 
as of december   there were million of claims made under three pemex contracts for extra work related to interferences  interruptions and other delays 
of the million of claims  million of claims relate to our most significant contract with pemex  the epc contract in the cantarell field 
pemex extended the epc contract  which had an original value of million  in scope to million of total revenue recognized 
this extension substantially increased the period of our operations in the cantarell field  and as a result  this project was subject to greater interruptions due to weather conditions and standby time as other contractors completed their work 
the claims on the epc contract could not be submitted in accordance with pemex requirements until all work was completed in the fourth quarter of cash provided by operations was million for compared to million of cash used in operations for during  costs in excess of billings decreased million compared to an increase of million in that related principally to contracts with pemex 
the decrease in was based upon billing and subsequent collection of accounts receivable related to pemex  the project in long island sound and the amistad development project in golfo de guayaquil  ecuador 
additionally  cash flows from operating activities included increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately million in and million in related to extensions in the timing of payments by us 
at december   we had approximately million of total outstanding debt 
this represents an approximate net decrease of million from december  primarily due to the use of million in equity offering proceeds to pay down our loans 
of the million of outstanding debt  million represents borrowings on our three revolving credit facilities and million represents borrowings on seven term debt facilities 
at december   we had million available under our three revolving credit facilities 
at march   we had million available under our three revolving credit facilities 
interest rates vary from libor plus to prime plus 
our weighted average interest rate was at december   and our term debt borrowings currently require  in monthly principal payments 
our loans require that certain conditions be met in order for us to obtain advances 
our loans are collateralized by mortgages on our vessels and accounts receivable 
advances under our revolving credit facilities may be obtained in accordance with a borrowing base defined as a percentage of accounts receivable balances and costs in excess of billings 
the loans contain customary defaults and some require us to maintain certain financial ratios 
the loan agreements also contain certain covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  create certain liens  sell assets and make capital expenditures 
in september and december  we amended one of our revolving credit facilities to increase the financial ratio related to our financial leverage of debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization for periods ending on or before june  we have experienced a reduction in our ebitda primarily due to reduced demand  lower margins on projects and the million loss related to the lone star horizon in the third quarter of we were in compliance with all of our amended debt covenants at december  we also incurred debt to fund our working capital requirements in mexico due to the timing of collections related to our pemex claims 
we may need to borrow additional funds to meet working capital requirements for contingent upon the timing and magnitude of collection of our pemex receivables and claims 
if we are required to make additional borrowings in excess of our current debt facilities  we will be required to amend financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities 
although we can provide no assurance  we believe that we will be able to borrow additional funds secured by mortgages on our vessels and amend financial covenants as required 
we have fixed debt service and lease payment obligations under notes payable and operating leases for which we have material contractual cash obligations 
interest rates on our debt vary from libor plus to prime plus 
the following table summarizes our long term material contractual cash obligations in millions thereafter principal and interest payments on debt operating leases current maturities of long term debt were million as of december  planned capital expenditures for are estimated to range from approximately million to million largely related to vessel improvements 
our strategy  however  is to make other acquisitions  to expand our operating capabilities and expand into additional selected international areas 
to the extent we are successful in identifying acquisition and expansion opportunities and have expanded our market share in those areas  we may require additional equity or debt financing depending on the size of any transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation on financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities during our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values and future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
as of december  the carrying value of our debt  including million of accrued interest  was approximately million 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in mexico  we collect a portion of our revenues and pay local expenses in foreign currency 
we manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars 
approximately of our current contracts with pemex is denominated in us dollars 
we receive payment in mexican pesos equivalent to the us dollars billed  which is converted to us dollars that day or the following day 
our contracts in mexico also typically provide some protection from declining exchange rates on the portion of the contract revenues denominated in foreign currency 
we recognized a million foreign currency loss due to activity denominated in mexican pesos and a decline of the mexican peso compared to the us dollar for we monitor the exchange rate of our foreign currencies in order to mitigate the risk from foreign currency fluctuations 
additional exposure could occur as we expand internationally 
the level of construction services required by a customer depends on the size of their capital expenditure budget for construction for the year 
consequently  customers that account for a significant portion of contract revenues in one year may represent an immaterial portion of contract revenues in subsequent years
