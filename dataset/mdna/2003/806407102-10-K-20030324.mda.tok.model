the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item herein 
overview we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets with operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  austria  spain  ireland  portugal  australia and new zealand

the international group is comprised of our healthcare distribution business units located primarily in europe  and offers products and services to dental and medical including veterinary customers located in their respective geographic regions 
the technology segment consists primarily of our practice management software business and certain other value added products and services which are distributed primarily to healthcare professionals in the united states and canada 
critical accounting policies and estimates securities exchange commission financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements management s estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to sales allowance provisions  as described below  volume purchase rebates  income taxes  inventory and bad debts reserves  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  industry and market trends  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenues derived from post contract customer support for practice management software are deferred and recognized ratably over the period in which the support is to be provided  generally one year 
revenues from freight charged to customers are recognized when products are shipped 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  customer returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
accounts receivable and credit policies the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  we consider many factors in estimating our general allowance  including historical data  experience  customer types  credit worthiness  and economic trends 
from time to time  we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of those or other factors expected to affect collectability 
allowances for accounts receivable  comprised primarily of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for sales returns  were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we have reassessed the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets  which primarily consist of non compete agreements  and no changes were deemed necessary 
goodwill at december   we had recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily related to acquisitions made in and prior years 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new standards  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas we estimated the fair value of our reporting units in accordance with the new standard and compared these valuations with the respective book values for each of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment existed 
the goodwill is substantially related to our healthcare distribution segment 
in determining the fair value  we consider past  present and future expectations of performance 
as required by fas  we will complete subsequent goodwill impairment tests at least annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the annual test using a methodology similar to the transitional test and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  could have a material impact on these estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded so long as the quoted market price of the stock at the date of grant is equal to the exercise price 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  fas 
had we elected to use fas to account for stock based compensation under the fair value method  we would have been required to record compensation expense  and as a result  diluted earnings per common share for the fiscal years ended december   and would have been lower by   and  respectively 
plan of restructuring on august   we announced a comprehensive restructuring plan designed to improve customer service and increase profitability by maximizing the efficiency of our infrastructure 
in addition to closing or downsizing certain facilities  this worldwide initiative included the elimination of approximately positions  including open positions  or approximately of the total workforce  throughout all levels within the organization 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed at december  for the years ended december  and december   we incurred one time restructuring costs of approximately million million after taxes and million  million after taxes  or approximately and per diluted share  respectively  consisting primarily of employee severance costs  including severance pay and benefits of approximately million and million  respectively  facility closing costs  primarily lease termination and asset write off costs of approximately million and million  respectively  and outside professional and consulting fees directly related to the restructuring plan of approximately million and million  respectively 
acquisition strategy our results of operations in recent years have been significantly impacted by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business  both domestically and internationally  in part  to address significant changes in the healthcare industry  including potential healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements 
in connection with certain acquisitions completed during the year ended december   we incurred certain merger and integration costs of approximately million 
net of taxes  merger and integration costs were approximately per share  on a diluted basis 
merger and integration costs for the healthcare distribution and technology segments were million and million for merger and integration costs consist primarily of investment banking  legal  accounting and advisory fees  severance  and impairment of goodwill arising from acquired businesses integrated into our medical and dental businesses  as well as certain other integration costs associated with these mergers 
during  we revised our original estimates of our merger and integration costs from prior years 
the change in estimates was attributable to facts and circumstances that arose subsequent to the original charges 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of our previously recorded expenses 
net of taxes  merger and integration credits were approximately per share  on a diluted basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales  gross profit and adjusted operating profit  excluding merger and integration  and restructuring credits costs in thousands  by business segment for the years ended   and percentages are calculated on related net sales

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly influences 
net sales and operating profits are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to timing of sales of software and equipment  year end promotions and purchasing patterns of office based healthcare practitioners and are generally lower in the first quarter due primarily to the increased purchases in the prior quarter 
quarterly results also may be materially affected by a variety of other factors  including the timing of acquisitions and related costs  timing of purchases and or sales  special promotional campaigns  seasonal products  fluctuations in exchange rates associated with international operations and adverse weather conditions 
e commerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being impacted by electronic on line commerce solutions 
our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and is highly competitive 
the rapid evolution of on line commerce will require us to provide continuous improvement in performance  features and reliability of internet content and technology  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
through our proprietary technologically based suite of products  we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives 
we believe that our tradition of reliable service coupled with our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships makes us well situated to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business 
we are exploring ways and means of improving and expanding our internet presence and will continue to do so 
inflation management does not believe inflation had a material effect on the financial statements for the periods presented 
effect of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  fas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force  eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  eitf 
the principal difference between this statement and eitf relates to the statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
those arrangements could involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  and the performance could occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the issue addresses when and  if so  how a company should divide an arrangement involving multiple deliverables into separate units of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb amended the transition and disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  fas  through the issuance of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  fas 
fas amends the existing disclosures that a company should make in its annual financial statements and requires  for the first time  disclosures in interim financial reports 
those disclosures are required regardless of the method being used to account for stock based employee compensation 
the amended and new disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ending december  the adoption of the disclosure requirements of fas will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
as permitted under fas  we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not expect this interpretation to have an effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is applicable immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created prior to january   the provisions of fin are applicable no later than july  we do not expect this interpretation to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
risk management we have operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  austria  spain  ireland  portugal  australia and new zealand 
we endeavor to protect substantially all of our operations financial results by using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge intercompany debt and the foreign currency payments to foreign vendors 
the total us dollar equivalent of all foreign currency forward contracts hedging intercompany debt and the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors was million and million  respectively  as of the end of fiscal as of december   the fair value of these contracts  which expire through january  is determined by quoted market prices and was not material 
for the year ended december   we recognized an immaterial loss relating to our foreign currency forward contracts 
we consider our investment in foreign operations to be both long term and strategic 
as a result  we do not hedge the long term translation exposure to our balance sheet 
we have experienced positive and negative translation adjustments of approximately million and million in and  respectively  which were reflected in the balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
the cumulative translation adjustment at the end of showed a net negative translation adjustment of million 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund a capital expenditures  b acquisitions  and c working capital needs resulting from increased sales and special inventory forward buy in opportunities 
since sales tend to be strongest during the fourth quarter and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year  our working capital requirements have been generally higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 
we have financed our business primarily through our operations  our revolving credit facilities  private placement loans and stock issuances 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from net income of million and non cash charges of approximately million  offset by a net increase in operating items of working capital of approximately million 
the increase in working capital items was primarily due to an increase in inventories of million  a million increase in other current assets  and a million increase in accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accruals 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding ratio improved to days for the period ending december   from days for the period ending december   primarily due to greater focus in this area 
our inventory turns were inventory turns for the period ending december  compared to inventory turns for the period ending december   primarily due to an increase in forward buy ins and inventory stocking for warehouses opened in we anticipate future increases in working capital requirements as a result of our continued sales growth  extended payment terms and special inventory forward buy in opportunities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from cash used for the purchases of united states government and government agency bonds  municipal bonds  and corporate bonds rated aaa by moody s or an equivalent rating and commercial paper rated p by moody s or an equivalent rating with maturities of more than three months  for which fair values are determined by quoted market prices  of million  capital expenditures of million  of which approximately million was for the purchase of a building used for our corporate headquarters  and business acquisitions of million  of which million represented contingent earnout payments associated with acquisitions made in prior years 
during the past three years  we have invested million in the development of new computer systems  and for new and existing operating facilities 
in the coming year  we expect to invest in excess of million in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and infrastructure computer systems  and integrate operations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from proceeds from the issuance of stock upon exercise of stock options of million  offset primarily by net payments on long term debt of million 
certain holders of minority interests in entities we have acquired have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their interest at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price based on earnings of the entity 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  of million consist of bank balances and investments in money market funds 
these investments have staggered maturity dates  none of which exceed three months  and have a high degree of liquidity since the securities are actively traded in public markets 
on may   we renewed and increased our revolving credit facility to million from million 
the new facility is a four year committed line scheduled to terminate on may  there were no borrowings under the credit facility at december  we also have one uncommitted bank line of million  of which no amounts have been borrowed against at december  on june  and september   we completed private placement transactions under which we issued million and million  respectively  in senior notes 
the million notes come due on june  and bear interest at a rate of per annum 
principal payments totaling million are due annually starting september  on the million notes and bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest on both notes is payable semi annually 
certain of our subsidiaries have credit facilities that totaled million at december   under which million had been borrowed 
the following table shows our contractual obligations related to fixed and variable rate long term debt  as well as lease obligations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years greater than years contractual obligations long term debt      capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations      total      on march   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock  which represented approximately of shares outstanding on the announcement date 
we expect purchases to be made from time to time in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents of million and our investment in short term marketable securities of million as of december   our ability to access public and private debt and equity markets  and the availability of funds under our existing credit agreements will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs 
item a 
market risk s we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing financial instruments that are consistent with our internal policies 
forward foreign currency contracts the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues as expressed in us dollars  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs aimed at limiting  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations 
using primarily forward exchange contracts  we hedge those transactions that  when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  may impact our statement of income 
from time to time  we purchase short term forward exchange contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany loans  of a long term investment nature  due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts aggregating million  of which million related to intercompany debt and million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors 
the contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of british pounds million  euros million  australian dollars million  swiss francs million  japanese yen million  and new zealand dollars million 
as of december   the fair value of these contracts  which are determined by quoted market prices and expire through january  was not material 
for the year ended december   we recognized an immaterial loss relating to our foreign currency forward contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all currency contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation 
although we maintain these programs to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products and services  or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs  our revenues or costs are adversely affected 
interest rates we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates from borrowings under certain variable bank credit lines and loan agreements 
we have fixed rate debt of million at and million at 
if the remaining outstanding debt at december  of million was the average balance for the following twelve month period and we experienced a increase in average interest rates  the interest expense for that period would have increased by million 
based upon current economic conditions  we do not believe interest rates will increase substantially in the near future 
as a result  we do not believe that it is currently necessary to hedge our exposure against potential future interest rate increases 
risk factors stockholders and investors should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this annual report 
our business  financial condition and operating results  and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if any of these risks materialize 
the healthcare products distribution industry is highly competitive  and we compete with numerous companies  including major manufacturers and distributors that have greater financial and other resources than us 
competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products or manufacturers could increase their efforts to sell directly to end users  thereby bypassing distributors like us 
consolidation among healthcare products distributors could result in existing competitors increasing their market position 
in addition  unavailability of products  whether due to our inability to gain access to products or interruptions in supply of products from manufacturers  could adversely affect our operating results 
in recent years  the healthcare industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and corporate health insurance plans  trends toward managed care  consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  electronic commerce  and collective purchasing arrangements among office based healthcare practitioners 
if we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the healthcare industry  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our technology segment  which primarily sells practice management software and other value added products  depends upon continued product development  technical support and marketing 
failures in these and related areas could adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to requirements under various local  state  federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices  including the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the prescription drug marketing act of and the controlled substances act 
there is no assurance that current or future government regulations will not adversely affect our business 
our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business  and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products 
we have insurance policies  including product liability insurance  and in many cases we have indemnification rights from manufacturers with respect to the products we distribute 
there is no assurance that insurance coverage or manufacturers indemnity will be available in all of the pending or any future cases brought against us  or that an unfavorable result in any such case will not adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our business is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified sales representatives  service specialists and other sales agents 
due to the relationships developed between our field sales representatives and their customers  upon the departure of a sales representative we face the risk of losing the representative s customers  especially if the representative becomes an employee of one of our competitors 
our business has been subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations 
net sales and operating profits generally have been higher in the fourth quarter due to purchasing patterns of office based healthcare practitioners and year end promotions 
net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first quarter  primarily due to increased purchases in the prior quarter 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  which could adversely affect our operating results 
these risks include difficulties in opening and managing foreign offices and distribution centers  difficulties in establishing channels of distribution  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic and political changes in foreign markets 
our expansion through acquisitions and or joint ventures could result in a loss of customers  diversion of management attention and increased demands on our operations  information systems and financial resources 
we rely on third parties to ship products to our customers 
increases in shipping rates or interruptions of service could adversely affect our operating results 
changes in e commerce could affect our business relationships and could require significant resources 
the evolution of on line commerce  including business to business exchanges  will require us to continuously improve the performance  security  features and reliability of internet content and technology
