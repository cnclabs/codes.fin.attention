coal royalty and land management operations overview at december   the partnership owned and leased approximately  acres in virginia  west virginia  new mexico and eastern kentucky containing approximately million tons of coal reserves 
the partnership earns coal royalty revenue  based on long term lease agreements  from coal mining operators actively mining under separate leases at mines 
coal royalty revenues under non peabody leases are based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal  with pre established minimum monthly or annual payments 
under the peabody leases  coal royalty revenues are based on fixed royalty rates which escalate annually  also with pre established monthly minimums 
the partnership does not operate coal mines 
the partnership provides fee based coal preparation and transportation facilities to some of its lessees to enhance their production levels and generate additional coal service revenues 
the partnership s timber assets consist of various hardwoods  primarily red oak  white oak  yellow poplar and black cherry 
the partnership owned approximately million board feet of standing saw timber at december  the partnership s timber inventory only includes timber that can be harvested and is greater than inches in diameter 
in december  the partnership announced the formation of an important strategic alliance with peabody energy corporation  the largest private sector coal company in the world 
central to the transaction was the purchase from and leaseback to peabody of approximately million tons of coal reserves located in new mexico million tons and northern west virginia million tons the peabody acquisition 
as a result of the peabody acquisition  the partnership s total reserves increased by approximately percent to million tons 
the peabody acquisition was funded with million in cash and the issuance by the partnership to page 
table of contents peabody of  common units and  class b common units 
of the class b common units issued   are currently being held in escrow pending certain approvals from the state of new mexico and peabody s acquisition and transfer to pvr of certain reserves 
as a result of the escrow arrangement  approximately five million tons of coal reserves were excluded from reserve totals and  class b common units were excluded from units issued in the partnership s financial statements for the year ended december  the alliance with peabody accomplishes several strategically important goals 
it provides geographic diversity by exposing the partnership to new markets in the western united states and northern appalachia 
the inclusion of affiliates of peabody as a significant part of the partnership s lessee mix adds additional strength and stability to its lessee group 
peabody is incentivized to source additional assets to the partnership in the future 
this incentive is derived not only from peabody s ownership of approximately percent of the partnership s common units  but also from its right to share in the general partner s incentive distribution rights if peabody sells additional coal assets to the partnership in the future 
see item corporate and other partnership distributions  incentive distribution rights for more information 
in addition to the peabody acquisition  in august  the partnership purchased approximately million tons of coal reserves in northern appalachia for million 
this acquisition was the partnership s first outside of central appalachia 
the properties  which include approximately  mineral acres  contain predominately high sulfur  high btu coal reserves 
in june  the partnership acquired the fork creek property in west virginia  purchasing approximately million tons of coal reserves for million 
in early  the operator at fork creek filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and operations at the mine were idled on march  the operator continued to pay minimum royalties until the partnership recovered its lease on august  in november  the partnership purchased various infrastructure at fork creek for million plus the assumption of certain reclamation liabilities and stream mitigation obligations 
with control of the reserves  permits and the critical infrastructure  pvr s management is working diligently to put a new  financially stable operator in place at fork creek 
as is customary in the partnership s operations  pvr intends to assign all related reclamation liabilities to the new operator 
coal royalties the partnership s lessees mined approximately million tons of coal in from pvr s properties and paid an average royalty of per ton  compared with approximately million tons mined in at an average royalty of per ton 
timber sales timber is harvested in advance of lessee mining to prevent loss of the resource 
timber is sold as individual parcels in competitive bid sales or on a contract basis  where pvr pays independent contractors to harvest timber while pvr directly markets the product 
the partnership sold approximately mmbf in at an average price of per thousand board feet mbf  compared with mmbf at an average price of per mbf in coal services the partnership generates coal service revenues from fees charged to lessees for the use of the partnership s coal preparation and transportation facilities 
the majority of these fees have been generated by the partnership s unit train loadout facility  which was completed in april at a cost of million 
this facility accommodates car unit trains  which can be loaded in approximately four hours 
lessees utilize the unit train loadout facility to reduce delivery costs incurred by their customers 
the partnership recognized million in coal service revenues in and such amounts are reported in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income included herein 
corporate and other partnership distributions we are entitled  through our wholly owned subsidiaries  to receive certain cash distributions payable with respect to the subordinated and common units of pvr held by such subsidiaries as well as certain cash distributions payable with respect to general partner incentive distribution rights held by our general partner subsidiary 
page 
table of contents cash distributions 
the partnership made its first cash distribution of per common and subordinated unit in february for the period october  through december  for  the partnership made quarterly cash distributions of per common unit and subordinated unit 
the partnership intends to increase quarterly cash distributions to per common unit and subordinated unit beginning with the distribution payable in may with respect to the first quarter of incentive distribution rights 
our wholly owned subsidiary is the general partner of pvr and  as such  holds certain incentive distribution rights which represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the partnership has paid minimum quarterly distributions and certain target distribution levels have been achieved 
the minimum quarterly distribution is per unit per unit on an annual basis 
the incentive distributions rights are payable as follows if for any quarter pvr has distributed available cash from operating surplus to its common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution  and pvr has distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution  then  pvr will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and our general partner subsidiary in the following manner first  percent to all unitholders  pro rata  and percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  second  percent to all unitholders  and percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  third  percent to all unitholders  and percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  and thereafter  percent to all unitholders and percent to the general partner 
in each case  the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units 
in conjunction with the peabody acquisition  our general partner subsidiary has issued a special membership interest which entitles peabody to receive increased percentages  starting at zero and increasing up to percent  of payments pvr makes to our general partner subsidiary with respect to incentive distribution rights if pvr purchases additional assets from peabody in the future

page 
table of contents risks associated with business activities oil and gas competition the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
our competitive position depends on our geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  our financial resources  our ability to develop properties and our ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
we compete with a substantial number of other companies having larger technical staffs and greater financial and operational resources 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  electricity generation and the marketing of refined products 
we also compete with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas  and the oil and natural gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
we compete with other oil and natural gas companies in attempting to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completion of wells 
such equipment may be in short supply from time to time 
price volatility historically  natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile 
these prices rise and fall based on changes in market demand and changes in the political  regulatory and economic climate and other factors that affect commodities markets that are generally outside of our control 
some of our projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes 
we expect our assumptions will change over time and that actual prices in the future may differ from our estimates 
any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of natural gas and or crude oil could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity  the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that we can economically produce  the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties and our ability to fund our capital program 
drilling and operating risks our drilling operations are subject to various risks common in the industry  including cratering  explosions  fires and uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids 
our drilling operations are also subject to the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reserves will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents and adverse weather conditions 
transportation we transport our natural gas to market on various gathering and transmission pipeline systems owned by third parties 
gathering fees are primarily paid by the purchaser of the natural gas 
the majority of natural gas sales contracts are one year or less in duration and contain relevant monthly index pricing provisions 
interruptible gathering rates have increased over the years as pipelines have implemented the mandatory unbundling of gathering services federal energy regulatory commission order from other transportation services 
in  duke energy  inc gathered and transported approximately percent of our natural gas  nisource  inc formerly columbia gas transmission approximately percent  and dominion energy  inc approximately percent  with the remainder divided among several pipeline companies in texas  west virginia and louisiana 
production could be adversely affected by shutdowns of the pipelines for maintenance or replacement as transportation options are limited 
regulation state regulatory matters 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas 
these provisions include the permitting for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  provisions relating to the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells that may be page 
table of contents drilled in an area  and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas  and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells  and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
federal energy regulatory commission 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of nga and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sales of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate gas producers like penn virginia corporation  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
in particular  the ferc has issued order no 
 which  among other things  i permits pipelines to charge different maximum cost based rates for peak and off peak times  ii encourages auctions for pipeline capacity  iii requires pipelines to implement imbalance management services  and iv restricts the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances  overruns  and non compliance with operational flow orders 
in addition  the ferc has implemented regulations governing the procedure for obtaining authorization to construct new pipeline facilities and has issued a policy statement  which it largely affirmed in a recent order on rehearing  establishing a presumption in favor of requiring owners of new pipeline facilities to charge rates based solely on the costs associated with such new pipeline facilities 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect us only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can we predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets 
however  we do not believe that we will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers and markets with which we compete 
environmental matters 
extensive federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect our operations  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations 
page 
table of contents coal royalty and land management although the partnership intends to make quarterly cash distributions of per common unit  it can only do so to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after payment of fees and expenses 
in addition  quarterly distributions are payable on our subordinated units only after each common unit has received a distribution of plus any arrearages due from prior quarters 
incentive distributions are payable to our general partner subsidiary after cash distributions per unit exceed in any quarter 
the partnership s revenues and its ability to make quarterly and incentive distributions are subject to several risks  including those described below 
competition the coal industry is intensely competitive primarily as a result of the existence of numerous producers 
the partnership s lessees compete with coal producers in various regions of the us for domestic sales 
the industry has undergone significant consolidation that has led to some of the competitors of the partnership s lessees located in appalachia to have significantly larger financial and operating resources than the partnership s lessees do 
the partnership s lessees primarily compete with both large and small producers in appalachia as well as the western united states 
they compete on the basis of coal price at the mine  coal quality including sulfur content  transportation cost from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply 
continued demand for the partnership s coal and the prices that the partnership s lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity  environmental and government regulations  technological developments and the availability and price of alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and hydroelectric power 
demand for the partnership s low sulfur coal and the prices the partnership s lessees will be able to obtain for it will also be affected by the price and availability of high sulfur coal  which can be marketed in tandem with emissions allowances in order to meet federal clean air act requirements 
operating risks general regulation 
the partnership s lessees are obligated to conduct mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include matters involving the discharge of materials into the environment  employee health and safety  mine permits and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  management of materials generated by mining operations  surface subsidence from underground mining  water pollution  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  plant and wildlife protection  limitations on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances which are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws  and management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls  or pcbs 
because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry and  notwithstanding compliance efforts  we do not believe violations by the partnership s lessees can be eliminated completely 
however  none of the violations to date  or the monetary penalties assessed  have been material to us  to the partnership or  to our knowledge  to the partnership s lessees 
we do not currently expect that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on us or the partnership 
while it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance by the partnership s lessees with all applicable federal and state laws  those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant 
the lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 
the partnership does not accrue for such costs because its lessees are contractually liable for all costs relating to their mining operations  including the costs of reclamation and mine closure 
however  the partnership does require some smaller lessees to deposit certain funds into escrow for reclamation and mine closure costs or post performance bonds for these costs 
although the lessees typically accrue adequate amounts for these costs  their future operating results would be adversely affected if they later determined these accruals to be insufficient 
compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers 
in addition  the utility industry  which is the most significant end user of coal  is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities which could affect demand for the partnership s lessees coal 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which may have a significant impact on the mining operations of the partnership s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require the partnership  its lessees or their customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
page 
table of contents regulation clean air act 
the clean air act affects the end users of coal and could significantly affect the demand for the partnership s coal and reduce the partnership s coal royalty revenues 
the clean air act and corresponding state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides and other compounds emitted from industrial boilers and power plants  including those that use the partnership s coal 
these regulations together constitute a significant burden on coal customers and stricter regulation could further adversely impact the demand for and price of the partnership s coal  resulting in lower coal royalty revenues 
in july  the us environmental protection agency adopted more stringent ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone 
particulate matter includes small particles that are emitted during the combustion process 
in a february decision  the us supreme court largely upheld the epa s position  although it remanded the epa s ozone implementation policy for further consideration 
details regarding the new particulate standard itself are still subject to judicial challenge 
these ozone restrictions will require electric power generators to further reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 
nitrogen oxides are naturally occurring byproducts of coal combustion that lead to the formation of ozone 
further reduction in the amount of particulate matter that may be emitted by power plants could also result in reduced coal consumption by electric power generators 
future regulations regarding ozone  particulate matter and other ambient air standards could restrict the market for coal and the development of new mines by the partnership s lessees 
this in turn may result in decreased production by the partnership s lessees and a corresponding decrease in the partnership s coal royalty revenues 
these decreases could adversely effect the distributions we receive from the partnership 
the clean air act also imposes standards on sources of hazardous air pollutants 
these standards have not yet been extended to coal mining operations or by products of coal combustion  but consideration is now being given to regulating certain hazardous air pollutant components that are found in coal combustion exhaust  including mercury 
like other environmental regulations  these standards and future standards could result in a decreased demand for coal 
surface mining control and reclamation act of the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra and similar state statutes impose on mine operators the responsibility of restoring the land to its original state or compensating the landowner for types of damages occurring as a result of mining operations  and require mine operators to post performance bonds to ensure compliance with any reclamation obligations 
regulatory authorities may attempt to assign the liabilities of the partnership s lessees to the partnership if any of the lessees are not financially capable of fulfilling those obligations 
in conjunction with mining the property  the partnership s lessees are contractually obligated under the terms of their leases to comply with all laws  including smcra and equivalent state and local laws  which obligations include reclaiming and restoring the mined areas by grading  shaping and reseeding the soil 
upon completion of the mining  reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for use as pasture or timberland  as specified in the approved reclamation plan 
cercla 
the partnership could become liable under federal and state superfund and waste management statutes if its lessees are unable to pay environmental cleanup costs 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  known as cercla or superfund  and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances to the environment and damages to natural resources 
as a landowner  the partnership is potentially subject to liability for these investigation and remediation obligations 
mountaintop removal litigation 
on january   the united states fourth circuit court of appeals the circuit court vacated an injunction issued in may by the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia the district court 
this injunction had prohibited the huntington  west virginia office of the us army corps of engineers the corps from issuing permits under section of the clean water act for the construction of valley fills for the disposal of coal mining overburden 
these valleys typically contain steams that  under the clean water act  are considered navigable waters of the united states 
the district court had found that the corp s permitting of overburden valley fills under section was a violation of the clean water act since section allows only the permitting of fill material deposited for a beneficial purpose and not for mere waste disposal such as the disposal of coal overburden 
the circuit court reversed this finding  concluding  instead  that overburden valley fills may be permitted under section and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the circuit court s opinion 
mine health and safety laws 
stringent safety and health standards have been imposed by federal legislation since the adoption of the mine health and safety act of the mine health and safety act of resulted in increased operating costs and reduced productivity 
the mine safety and health act of  which significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the mine health and safety act of  imposes comprehensive safety and health standards on all mining operations 
in addition  as part of the mine health and safety acts of and  the black lung acts require payments of benefits by all businesses conducting current mining operations to coal miners with black lung and to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease 
page 
table of contents mining permits and approvals 
numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations 
in connection with obtaining these permits and approvals  the partnership s lessees may be required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment 
the requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining operations 
in order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities  mine operators  including the partnership s lessees  must submit a reclamation plan for restoring  upon the completion of mining operations  the mined property to its prior condition  productive use or other permitted condition 
typically lessees submit the necessary permit applications between and months before they plan to begin mining a new area 
in the partnership s experience  permits generally are approved within months after a completed application is submitted 
in the past  lessees have generally obtained their mining permits without significant delay 
the partnership s lessees have obtained or applied for permits to mine a majority of the reserves that are currently planned to be mined by lessees over the next five years 
the partnership s lessees are in the planning phase for obtaining permits for the remaining reserves planned to be mined over the next five years 
however  they cannot make any assurances that they will not experience difficulty in obtaining mining permits in the future 
timber regulations 
the partnership s timber operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those related to the environment  protection of endangered species  foresting activities and health and safety 
the partnership believes it is managing its timberlands in substantial compliance with applicable federal and state regulations

net proved oil and gas reserves for the three years ended december  were estimated by wright and company  inc prices for oil and gas are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations and prices for each are subject to substantial fluctuations as a result of numerous other factors 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the pre tax sec pv value amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the page

table of contents coal royalty and land management the partnership s coal reserves at december  covered  acres  including fee and leased acreage  in virginia  west virginia  new mexico and eastern kentucky 
the coal reserves are in various surface and underground seams 
the partnership s proven and probable coal reserves are estimated at million tons as of december  reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
proven coal reserves are reserves for which a the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  working or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  and depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  the partnership performs additional drilling to ensure the continuity and mineablility of coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s reserves are high in energy content  low in sulfur and suitable for either steam or metallurgical markets 
the amount of coal a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs 
the partnership s timber assets consist of various hardwoods  primarily red oak  white oak  yellow poplar and black cherry 
at december   the partnership owned an estimated mmbf of standing saw timber

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following review of operations and financial condition of penn virginia corporation and subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview penn virginia corporation penn virginia or the company is an independent energy company that is engaged in two primary business segments 
our oil and gas segment explores for  develops and produces crude oil  condensate and natural gas primarily in the eastern and gulf coast onshore areas of the united states 
our coal royalty and land management segment operates through our ownership in penn virginia resource partners  lp the partnership or pvr  a delaware limited partnership  see note penn virginia resource partners  lp of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are committed to increasing value to our shareholders by conducting a balanced program of investment in our two business segments 
in the oil and gas segment  we intend to execute a program combining relatively low risk  moderate return development drilling in the east with higher risk  higher return exploration and development drilling in the onshore gulf coast  supplemented periodically with acquisitions 
in addition to our continuing development program  we are expanding our eastern presence by developing coalbed methane gas reserves in appalachia 
by employing horizontal drilling techniques  we expect to increase production rates from coalbed methane reserves we own 
we are also committed to expanding our onshore gulf coast reserves and production internally through our drilling program and by acquiring reserves with favorable return potential 
in  these efforts resulted in a percent increase in oil and gas production from  and we expect an increase in oil and gas production of at least percent  with a corresponding increase in operating cash flow 
in january  we completed an acquisition of approximately bcfe of proved reserves in the south texas area of the onshore gulf coast region for million  which will provide a significant part of the expected growth in production 
our oil and gas capital expenditures for  including the january south texas acquisition  are expected to be to million 
borrowings against our million credit facility were million as of december   and we expect to fund our capital expenditures with a combination of internal cash flow and credit facility borrowings 
during  pvr completed its first two coal reserve acquisitions since its initial public offering in october in december  pvr announced the formation of a strategic alliance with peabody  resulting from the purchase from and leaseback to peabody of approximately million tons of coal reserves in new mexico and northern west virginia for million in cash and a total of million common units and class b common units 
the peabody acquisition significantly expanded pvr s geographic diversity and included incentives for peabody to source additional assets to the partnership in the future 
in august  pvr also purchased approximately million tons of coal reserves in northern west virginia for million 
the two acquisitions are expected to contribute million to million tons of production and million to million of cash flow from operations to pvr in coal related capital expenditures in are expected to be to million for the construction of new coal service related projects for which pvr will collect a fee 
as of december   pvr had borrowed million against its credit facility  and it is currently attempting to refinance those borrowings with a more permanent form of debt 
the partnership expects to complete the refinancing during the first quarter of cash flow from operations  supplemented with credit facility borrowings  are expected to be adequate for pvr to fund capital expenditures and distributions to unitholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates oil and gas properties 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
under this method of accounting  costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties and to drill and equip development wells including development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves  respectively 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  and later charged to expense upon determination that the well does not justify commercial development 
other exploratory costs  including annual delay rentals and geological and geophysical costs  are charged to expense when incurred 
page 
table of contents the costs of unproved leaseholds are capitalized pending the results of exploration efforts 
unproved leasehold costs are assessed periodically  on a property by property basis  and a loss is recognized to the extent  if any  the cost of the property has been impaired 
as unproved leaseholds are determined to be productive  the related costs are transferred to proved leaseholds 
as of december   we had approximately million of unproved leasehold costs included in oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to complete an evaluation of our unproved leaseholds over the next two to three years 
other property and equipment 
other property and equipment is carried at cost and includes expenditures for additions and improvements  which substantially increase the productive lives of existing assets 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation of property and equipment is generally computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  varying from years to years 
coal properties are depleted on an area by area basis at a rate based upon the cost of the mineral properties and estimated proven and probable tonnage therein 
when an asset is retired or sold  its cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
the difference between undepreciated cost and proceeds from disposition is recorded as a gain or loss 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved oil and gas properties and the partnership s coal properties  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss must be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
in this circumstance  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated to be the expected present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted utilizing a risk free interest rate commensurate with the remaining lives for the respective oil and gas properties 
oil and gas revenues 
oil and gas sales revenues are recognized when crude oil and natural gas volumes are produced and sold for our account 
each working interest owner in a well generally has the right to a specific percentage of production  and often actual production sold for any particular owner will differ from such owner s ownership percentage 
when  under contract terms  these differences are settled in cash  revenues are adjusted accordingly 
coal royalties 
coal royalty revenues are recognized on the basis of tons of coal sold by the partnership s lessees and the corresponding revenue from those sales 
coal leases other than those with peabody affiliates are based on minimum monthly or annual payments  a minimum dollar royalty per ton and or a percentage of the gross sales price 
peabody leases are leased on fixed royalties which escalate annually and also provide for minimum monthly payments 
coal services 
coal services revenues are recognized when lessees use the partnership s facilities for the processing and transportation of coal 
coal services revenues consist of fees collected from the partnership s lessees for the use of the partnership s loadout facility  coal preparation plant  dock loading facility 
timber 
timber revenues are recognized as timber is sold on a contract basis where independent contractors harvest and sell the timber and  from time to time  in a competitive bid process involving sales of standing timber on individual parcels 
title and risk of loss pass to the independent contractors upon the execution of the contract 
in addition  if the contractors do not harvest the timber within the specified time period  the title of the timber reverts back to the partnership with no refund of original payment 
minimum rentals 
most of the partnership s lessees must make minimum monthly or annual payments that are generally recoupable over certain time periods 
these minimum payments are recorded as deferred income 
if the lessee recoups a minimum payment through production  the deferred income attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as coal royalty revenues 
if a lessee fails to meet its minimum production for certain pre determined time periods the recoupment period  the deferred income attributable to the minimum payment is recognized as minimum rental revenues 
revenues associated with minimum rentals are included in other revenues 
price risk management activities 
from time to time  we enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to natural gas and crude oil price volatility 
the derivative financial instruments  which are placed with major financial institutions that we believe are minimum credit risks  take the form of costless collars and swaps 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
currently  we are utilizing only cash flow hedges and the remaining discussion will relate exclusively to this type of derivative instrument 
all hedge transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which has been reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking page 
table of contents all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions 
we measure hedge effectiveness on a period basis 
when it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge  or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet  with changes in its fair value recognized in earnings prospectively 
gains and losses on hedging instruments when settled are included in natural gas or crude oil production revenues in the period that the related production is delivered 
the fair values of our hedging instruments are determined based on third party forward price quotes for nymex henry hub and west texas intermediate closing prices 
reserves 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating crude oil and natural gas reserve quantities  projecting future production rates and projecting the timing of future development expenditures 
in addition  reserve estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of properties with a production history 
accordingly  these estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at the end of the respective years 
proved developed reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered through existing equipment and operating methods 
results of operations selected financial data consolidated in millions  except share data revenues operating costs and expenses operating income net income net income per share  basic net income per share  diluted cash flows provided by operating activities consolidated net income our net income was million  compared with million in and million in revenues for were million  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the results included a pre tax gain on the sale of securities of approximately million million after tax 
also included in the results was the impairment of certain oil and gas properties  for which we recorded a million million after tax impairment charge 
in addition to the gain on sale of securities  net of the impairment charge noted above  the decrease in net income from was primarily due to lower natural gas prices and the minority interest resulting from the ownership change of our coal reserves in connection with the initial public offering of the partnership s common units in the fourth quarter of in  we recorded a pre tax gain of million million after tax on the sale of non strategic natural gas properties located in kentucky and west virginia 
the decrease in net income from was primarily due to increased exploration  operating and general and administrative expenses as a result of the acquisition of gulf coast properties in corporate and other dividends 
in april  we sold million shares of common stock of norfolk southern corporation at an average selling price of per share 
proceeds  net of commissions  totaled approximately million 
as a result  dividend income decreased from million in to million in no dividends were received during page 
table of contents oil and gas segment in our oil and gas segment  we explore for  develop and produce crude oil and natural gas in the eastern and gulf coast onshore regions of the united states 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
under this method of accounting  costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties and to drill and equip development wells including development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves and proved reserves  respectively

as unproved leaseholds are determined to be productive  the related costs are transferred to proved leaseholds 
oil and natural gas revenues are generally recorded using the entitlement method in which we recognize our ownership interest in the production as revenue 
each working interest owner in a well generally has the right to a specific percentage of production  although actual production sold may differ from an ownership percentage 
using entitlement accounting  a receivable is recorded when sales are less than our entitlement and deferred revenue is recognized when sales are greater than our entitlement 
we review our long lived assets  including proved oil and natural gas properties  for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss must be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows 
in this circumstance  we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated using the expected present value of future net cash flows from proved reserves  utilizing a risk free interest rate 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  which are affected by numerous factors that are generally beyond the company s control 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
natural gas prices are influenced by national and regional supply and demand 
a substantial or extended decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and cash flow and could  under certain circumstances  result in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
our future profitability and growth is also highly dependent on the results of our exploratory and development drilling programs

crude oil and natural gas production increased to bcfe in  a percent increase over the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of production from the gulf coast oil and gas properties acquired in july and development drilling success in connection with our gulf coast  mississippi and appalachian assets 
approximately percent of our production was natural gas 
the average natural gas price received during was per mcf compared with per mcf in  a percent decrease 
the average oil price received was per barrel for  up three percent from per barrel in due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we sometimes hedge the price received for sales volumes through the use of swaps and costless collars 
gains and losses from hedging activities are included in revenues when the hedged production occurs 
we recognized a loss on settled hedging activities of million in and a gain of million in operating expenses 
production costs increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the full year impact of operating costs related to our acquisition of certain gulf coast oil and gas properties in late july of exploration expenses decreased from million in to million in due to lower exploratory dry hole costs incurred this year

coal royalty and land management segment the coal royalty and land management segment includes pvr s mineral rights to coal reserves  its timber assets and its other land assets 
the assets  liabilities and earnings of pvr are fully consolidated in our financial statements  with the public unitholders interest reflected as a minority interest 
the partnership enters into leases with various third party operators for the right to mine coal reserves on the partnership s properties in exchange for royalty payments 
coal royalty revenues under non peabody leases are based on the higher of a percentage of the gross sales price or a fixed price per ton of coal sold  with pre established minimum monthly or annual payments 
under the peabody leases  coal royalty revenues are based on fixed royalty rates which escalate annually  also with pre established monthly minimums 
in addition to coal royalty revenues  the partnership generates coal service revenues from fees charged to lessees for the use of coal preparation and transportation facilities 
the partnership also generates revenues from the sale of timber on its properties 
the coal royalty stream is impacted by several factors  which pvr generally cannot control 
the number of tons mined annually is determined by an operator s mining efficiency  labor availability  geologic conditions  access to capital  ability to market coal and ability to arrange reliable transportation to the end user 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which may have a significant impact on the mining operations of the partnership s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require pvr  its lessees or its lessee s customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs

timber revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or percent 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average price received for the timber from per mbf for the year ended december  to per mbf for the year ended december  the decrease reflects overall market conditions as well as the sale of lower priced species and lower quality timber 
coal services revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  an increase of million  or percent

proven and probable coal reserves the partnership s proven and probable coal reserves were million tons at december  compared with million tons at december  royalties were collected for million tons mined on the partnership s properties in capital resources and liquidity prior to  the company satisfied its working capital requirements and funded its capital expenditure and dividend payments with cash generated from operations and credit facility borrowings 
in  the acquisition of gulf coast properties was funded with credit facility borrowings that were subsequently repaid with proceeds from pvr s initial public offering 
although results are consolidated for financial reporting  the resultant change in ownership structure of pvr caused the company and pvr to operate with independent capital structures 
the company and pvr have separate credit facilities  for which neither entity guarantees the debt of the other 
since pvr s public offering  the cash needs of each entity have been met independently with a combination of operating cash flows  credit facility borrowings and  in the case of pvr s peabody acquisition  issuance of new partnership units 
we expect that the cash needs of the company and pvr will continue to be met with a combination of these funding sources 
except where noted  the following discussion of cash flows and contractual obligations relates to consolidated results of the company and pvr 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with million in and million in our consolidated cash balance increased to million in compared with million in and million in  respectively 
as a result of pvr s public offering  approximately million and million of the consolidated cash balance as of december  and  respectively  was held by pvr primarily for working capital requirements 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million in  compared with million in and million in cash was used during these periods primarily for capital expenditures for oil and gas development and exploration activities and acquisitions of oil and gas and coal properties  offset in part by proceeds from sales of securities and non strategic oil and gas properties

we have a portfolio of assets which balance relatively low risk  moderate return development projects in appalachia  mississippi and west texas with relatively moderate risk  potentially higher return development projects and exploration prospects in south texas and south louisiana 
oil and gas segment capital expenditures for  including our january acquisition of properties in south texas for million  are estimated to be to million 
approximately to million of the planned oil and gas capital expenditures are expected to be for development drilling projects  including horizontal coalbed methane drilling in appalachia  development of the south texas properties acquired in january and continued drilling in our mississippi and west texas fields 
exploration drilling is expected to be approximately to million of the planned expenditures  concentrated primarily in south louisiana and south texas 
expenditures to build our library of d seismic data for drilling prospect generation is expected to be approximately to million  and lease acquisition and field project expenditures are expected to be to million 
capital expenditures for in the coal royalty and land management segment are expected to be up to million for the construction of fee based infrastructure facilities 
we continually review drilling and other capital expenditure plans and may change these amounts based on industry conditions and the availability of capital 
we believe our cash flow from operations and sources of debt financing are sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditure program 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in  compared with million in and million in credit facility borrowings provided approximately million of cash from financing activities during  offset in part by million of dividend payments and distributions to pvr s minority unitholders of million

the revolver contains financial covenants requiring the company to maintain certain levels of net worth  debt to capitalization and dividend limitation restrictions  among other requirements 
we currently have a million line of credit with a financial institution due in march  renewable annually 
we have the option to elect either a fixed rate libor loan or floating rate libor loan 
in connection with the closing of its initial public offering in  pvr entered into a three year credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions led by pnc bank  national association 
the credit agreement consists of two facilities  a revolving credit facility of million the pvr revolver and a term loan facility of up to million the pvr term loan 
both credit facilities mature in october the pvr revolver is available for general partnership purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions  and includes a million distribution sublimit that is available for working capital needs and distributions and a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
in connection with the closing of its initial public offering  pvr borrowed million under the pvr term loan and purchased and pledged million of us treasury notes  which secured the term loan facility 
in  the us treasury notes were liquidated for the purpose of funding acquisitions  and as of december   the obligations under the pvr term loan facility were unsecured 
total borrowings of as of december  against the pvr revolver and pvr term loan were million and million  respectively 
the pvr credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring the partnership to certain levels of net worth and of debt to ebitda as defined by the credit agreement 
the partnership has the option to elect interest at i libor plus a euro rate margin of percent  based on certain financial data  or ii the greater of the prime rate or federal funds rate plus

pvr is currently attempting to refinance up to million of borrowings against its credit agreement with more permanent debt 
this refinancing is expected to be completed by march   with proceeds used to repay and retire the pvr term loan and to repay most of the borrowings on the pvr revolver 
if the refinancing is not completed by march   pvr will be required to provide security to the syndicate of financial institutions in its credit agreement for all borrowings against its credit agreement 
management believes its sources of funding are sufficient to meet short and long term liquidity needs not funded by cash flows from operations

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december   are as follows total payments due by period thereafter less than year years years in thousands penn virginia revolver pvr revolver pvr term loan line of credit rental commitments total contractual cash obligations rental commitments primarily relate to equipment  car and building leases 
also included are the partnership s rental commitments  which primarily relate to reserve based properties which are  or are intended to be  subleased by the partnership to third parties 
the obligation expires when the property has been mined to exhaustion or the lease has been canceled 
the timing of mining by third party operators is difficult to estimate due to numerous factors 
we believe the obligation after five years cannot be reasonably estimated  however  based on current knowledge  we believe the partnership will incur approximately million in rental commitments in perpetuity until the reserves have been exhausted 
environmental matters our businesses are subject to various environmental hazards 
several federal  state and local laws  regulations and rules govern the environmental aspects of our businesses 
noncompliance with these laws  regulations and rules can result in substantial penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe our environmental risks are materially different from those of comparable companies nor that cost of compliance will have a material adverse effect on our profitability  capital expenditures  cash flows or competitive position 
however  there is no assurance that future changes in or additions to laws  regulations or rules regarding the protection of the environment will not have such an impact 
we believe we are materially in compliance with environmental laws  regulations and rules 
in conjunction with the partnership s leasing of property to coal operators  environmental and reclamation liabilities are generally the responsibilities of the partnership s lessees 
lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary
