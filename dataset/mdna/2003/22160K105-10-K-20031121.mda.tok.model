critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations 
management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates  including those related to merchandise inventory  impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting  and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
the company records an adjustment each quarter for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
the company considers in its calculation of the lifo cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than lifo inventory 
the company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results  which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates earned when those rebates are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approach 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
the company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
future circumstances may result in the company s actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates 
insurance self insurance liabilities the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions
