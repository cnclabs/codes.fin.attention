item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effective december   milacron began reporting four business segments machinery technologies north america  machinery technologies europe  mold technologies and industrial fluids 
the first three segments comprise milacron s plastics technologies business 
acquisitions as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the years through milacron completed a total of seven acquisitions of smaller companies that are now included in its plastics technologies segments 
the most significant were the acquisitions of reform flachstahl reform and eoc normalien eoc  two businesses headquartered in germany that manufacture and distribute mold bases and components for injection molding 
in the aggregate  the seven acquired businesses had annual sales of approximately million as of the respective acquisition dates 
presence outside the us beginning with the acquisition of ferromatik in  milacron has significantly expanded its presence outside the us and become more globally balanced 
for  markets outside the us represented the following percentages of our consolidated sales europe  canada and mexico  asia  and the rest of the world 
as a result of this geographic mix  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the translation of our sales and earnings  as well as consolidated shareholders equity 
during  the weighted average exchange rate of the euro was stronger in relation to the us dollar than in as a result  milacron experienced favorable translation effects on new orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
the effect on earnings was not material 
between december  and december   the euro strengthened against the dollar by approximately which caused a majority of a million increase in consolidated shareholders equity due to favorable foreign currency translation adjustments 
if the euro should weaken against the us dollar in future periods  we could experience a negative effect in translating our european new orders  sales and earnings when compared to historical results 
significant accounting policies and judgments the consolidated financial statements discussed herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are included therein 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies  estimates and judgmental matters that management believes are significant to milacron s reported financial position and results of operations 
additional accounting policies are described in the note captioned summary of significant accounting policies on pages through of this form k  which should be read in connection with the discussion that follows 
management regularly reviews its estimates and judgments and the assumptions regarding future events and economic conditions that serve as their basis 
while management believes the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements to be reasonable in the circumstances  the recorded amounts could vary under different conditions or assumptions 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances at december   milacron had significant deferred tax assets related to us and us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and to charges that have been deducted for financial reporting purposes but which are not yet deductible for income tax reporting 
these charges include the effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
and a charge to equity related to minimum pension funding 
at december   we have provided valuation allowances against some of these assets 
valuation allowances serve to reduce the recorded deferred tax assets to amounts reasonably expected to be realized as tax savings in the future 
the establishment of valuation allowances and their subsequent adjustment requires a significant amount of judgment because the realization of deferred tax assets particularly those assets related to net operating loss carryforwards is generally contingent on the generation of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities in the future and the availability of qualified tax planning strategies 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers its long range internal operating plans  which are based on the current economic environment  management s best estimate of future economic conditions in the countries in which milacron operates  and the effect of potential economic changes on the company s various operations 
at december   milacron had a us federal net operating loss carryforward of million which expires in deferred tax assets related to this loss carryforward and to additional state and local loss carryforwards totaled million 
additional deferred tax assets totaling approximately million have also been provided for book deductions not currently deductible for tax purposes including the writedown of goodwill  postretirement health care benefit costs and accrued pension liabilities 
no valuation allowances have been provided with respect to these assets because management believes they will be fully realized 
this judgment is based on the availability of qualified tax planning strategies  the expectation of increased us industrial production and capital spending in and on the significant reductions in milacron s cost structure that have been achieved in recent years and that will be achieved through the restructuring programs that are currently in progress and that may be announced in the future see restructuring costs on page 
at december   milacron had non us net operating loss carryforwards principally in the nether 
table of contents lands  germany and italy totaling million and related deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances totaling million have been provided with respect to these assets 
management believes that it is more likely than not that portions of the net operating loss carryforwards in these jurisdictions will be utilized 
however  there is currently insufficient positive evidence to conclude that no valuation allowances are required 
if management s current estimates and the related assumptions change in the future  milacron may be required to record new valuation allowances or increase the allowances that are already recorded 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the period of the change 
conversely  reductions of valuation allowances as a result of changes in estimates or assumptions would have a beneficial effect on milacron s provision for income taxes 
accounts receivable  inventory and warranty reserves milacron s internal accounting policies require that each of its operations maintain appropriate reserves for uncollectible receivables  inventory obsolescence and warranty costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
because of the diversity of milacron s customers and product lines  the specific procedures used to calculate these reserves vary by location but in all cases must conform to company guidelines 
reserves are required to be reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts are generally established using specific percentages of the gross receivable amounts based on their age as of a particular balance sheet date 
the amounts calculated through this process are then adjusted for known credit risks and collection problems 
write offs of accounts receivable for milacron s continuing operations have averaged million during the last three years 
while management believes that the company s reserves for doubtful accounts are reasonable in the circumstances  adverse changes in general economic conditions or in the financial condition of milacron s major customers could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
reserves for inventory obsolescence are generally calculated by applying specific percentages to inventory carrying values based on the level of usage and sales in recent years 
these calculations are then adjusted based on current economic trends  expected product line changes  changes in customer requirements and other factors 
in  milacron s continuing operations recorded new inventory obsolescence reserves totaling million and utilized million of such reserves in connection with the disposal of obsolete inventory 
management believes that milacron s reserves are appropriate in light of its historical results and its assumptions regarding the future 
however  adverse economic changes or changes in customer requirements could necessitate the recording of additional reserves through charges to earnings in the future 
milacron s warranty reserves are of two types normal and extraordinary 
normal warranty reserves are intended to cover routine costs associated with the repair or replacement of products sold in the ordinary course of business during the warranty period 
these reserves are accrued on a percentage of sales method based on the ratio of actual warranty costs over a representative number of years to sales revenues from products sold with warranties over the same period 
the percentages are required to be adjusted at least annually 
extraordinary warranty reserves are intended to cover major problems related to a single machine or customer order or to problems related to a large number of machines or other type of product 
these reserves are intended to cover the estimated costs of resolving the problems based on all relevant facts and circumstances 
in recent years  costs related to extraordinary warranty problems have not been significant 
in  milacron s continuing operations accrued warranty reserves totaling million and incurred warranty related costs totaling million 
while management believes that the company s warranty reserves are adequate in the circumstances  unforeseen problems related to unexpired warranty obligations could result in a requirement for additional reserves in the future 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill milacron reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets annually 
these reviews are conducted by comparing the estimates of undiscounted future cash flows that are included in milacron s long range internal operating plans to the carrying values of the related assets 
no growth in operating cash flows beyond the third year is assumed 
under this methodology  impairment would be deemed to exist if the carrying values exceeded the expected future cash flow amounts 
in  milacron reviewed the aggregate carrying values of selected groups of its long lived assets under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the assets included in these reviews consisted principally of property  plant and equipment and  where applicable  intangible assets other than goodwill 
based on these reviews  it was determined that the maximum period of time to recover the carrying values of the tested groups of assets through undiscounted cash flows is approximately years and that the weighted average recovery period is approximately of the remaining average lives of the assets 
based on the results of the reviews  no impairment charges were recorded in in years prior to  milacron reviewed the carrying value of goodwill annually using estimated undiscounted future cash flows in a manner similar to the methodology described above 
using this approach in  the maximum period of time to recover the carrying value of recorded goodwill through undiscounted cash flows was determined to be approximately years and the weighted average recovery period was approximately of the average remaining amortization period 
however  effective january  milacron adopted statement of financial 
table of contents accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using probability weighted cash flows discounted at market interest rates 
the change from undiscounted to discounted cash flows resulted in a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax that was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting method as of january  as required by sfas no 
 milacron conducted its first annual review of the remaining goodwill balances as of october  this review resulted in an additional pretax impairment charge of million with no tax benefit that was recorded in the fourth quarter 
insurance reserves through its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  milacron assurance ltd 
mal  milacron is primarily self insured for many types of risks  including general liability  product liability  environmental claims and worker s compensation for certain domestic employees 
mal  which is incorporated in bermuda and is subject to the insurance laws and regulations of that jurisdiction  establishes reserves commensurate with known or estimated exposures under the policies it issues to milacron 
exposure for general and product liability claims is supplemented by reinsurance coverage in some cases and by excess liability coverage in all policy years 
worker s compensation claims in excess of certain limits are insured with commercial carriers 
at december   mal had reserves for known claims and incurred but not reported claims under all coverages totaling approximately million 
a majority of this amount is included in long term accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at that date 
mal s reserves are established based on known claims  including those arising from litigation  and management s best estimates of the ultimate exposures thereunder after consideration of excess carriers liabilities and on estimates of the cost of incurred but not reported claims 
for certain types of exposures  mal and the company utilize actuarially calculated estimates prepared by outside consultants to ensure the adequacy of the reserves 
reserves are reviewed and adjusted quarterly based on all evidence available as of the respective balance sheet dates 
while the ultimate amount of mal s exposure to claims is dependent on future events that cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the recorded reserves are adequate in the circumstances 
however  claims in excess of the recorded amounts could adversely affect earnings in the future when additional information becomes available 
pensions milacron maintains defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
the most significant of these plans is the principal defined benefit plan for certain us employees  which is also the only defined benefit plan that is funded 
before deducting charges of million for supplemental retirement benefits  milacron recorded normal pension income of million related to this plan in expense related to the other plans totaled million 
a significant factor in determining the amount of income recorded for the funded us plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in and in several preceding years  milacron used an expected long term rate of return of 
however  the company will begin using a rate of return of beginning in this rate was developed based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments judgmentally reduced to reflect more conservative expectations of future returns 
in evaluating future returns on equity securities  the existing portfolio was stratified to separately consider large and small capitalization investments as well as international securities 
based on the methodology described below  the change from the rate of return assumption to the lower rate will have the effect of reducing the amount of pension income that would otherwise be reportable in by approximately million 
in determining the amount of pension income or expense to be recognized  the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a three year period 
this practice is intended to reduce year to year volatility in recorded pension income or expense but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on the long term rate of return assumption 
at december   the market value of milacron s pension assets was million whereas the calculated value of these assets was million 
the difference arises because the latter amount includes only two thirds and one third of the asset related losses incurred in and  respectively 
in the absence of significant asset related gains in  recognition of additional deferred losses in and will have the effect of significantly increasing the amount of pension expense to be recognized in those years in relation to in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension income or expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at december   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was reduced from to 
the rate was further lowered to at december  the combined effects of these changes and the losses in relation to the 
table of contents long term rate of return assumption discussed above have resulted in cumulative losses in excess of the corridor 
amortization of these losses will adversely affect pension expense in by approximately million 
as discussed above  milacron recorded pension income of million related to its principal us plan in however  due to the combined effects of the lower rate of return assumption  the asset related losses incurred in recent years and the amortization of cumulative losses  milacron expects to record pension expense related to this plan of approximately million in in the absence of significant asset related gains or an increase in the plan s discount rate  expense for and beyond could be as much as million per year 
because of the significant decrease in the value of the assets of the funded plan for us employees during and and the simultaneous decreases in the plan s discount rate  milacron was required to record a minimum pension liability adjustment of million effective december  and to significantly reduce the carrying value of the pension asset related to the plan 
these adjustments were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and therefore did not affect reported earnings 
however  they resulted in a million after tax reduction of shareholders equity 
results of operations in an effort to help readers better understand the composition of milacron s operating results  certain of the discussions that follow include references to restructuring costs and other items of income and expense 
accordingly  those discussions should be read in connection with i the tables on page of this form k under the caption comparative operating results and ii the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included herein on pages through discontinued operations as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of milacron completed the sales of its valenite  widia and werk metalcutting tools businesses and began to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of its round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses 
all of these businesses are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
the comparisons of results of operations that follow exclude these businesses and relate solely to the company s continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
compared to new orders and sales in  consolidated new orders for continuing operations totaled million  a decrease of million  or  in relation to orders of million in sales decreased from million to million 
the decreases occurred despite favorable currency effects and the contributions of the acquisitions 
as was the case for much of  low levels of industrial production and capital spending in the plastics processing industry penalized results in however  order levels and shipments increased modestly in the fourth quarter 
export orders totaled million in compared to million in while export sales decreased from million to million 
in both cases  the decreases resulted from reduced export volume for plastics processing machinery 
sales of all segments to non us customers  including exports  totaled million  or of sales  in compared to million  or of sales  in sales of products manufactured outside the us were million in and million in milacron s backlog of unfilled orders was million at december  and million at december  the increase resulted principally from higher fourth quarter order levels for plastics processing machinery worldwide 
margins  costs and expenses after deducting million of restructuring costs related to product line discontinuation in and million of such costs in  the consolidated manufacturing margin increased modestly from to 
excluding these costs  margins were in and in despite our aggressive cost reduction efforts  lower order and sales volume and reduced manufacturing cost absorption continued to depress the margins of certain segments as described below 
in  total selling and administrative expense decreased in dollar amount due to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives and reduced variable selling costs that resulted from lower sales volume 
as a percentage of sales  selling expense held steady at 
administrative expense decreased by in relation to other expense net decreased from million in to an insignificant net amount in the amount for includes million of royalty income from the licensing of patented technology whereas the amount for includes goodwill amortization expense of million and a gain of million on the sale of surplus real estate 
interest expense net of interest income totaled million in and million in restructuring costs in response to exceptionally low order levels  in the third and fourth quarters of we implemented plans to consolidate manufacturing operations and further reduce milacron s cost structure 
these plans  which are discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  resulted in pretax charges to earnings from continuing operations of million  including million in and million in in  we also initiated a plan to integrate the operations of eoc and reform  both of which were acquired in the second quarter of that year  with 
table of contents our existing mold base and components business in europe 
the total cost of completing the integration was million  of which million is included in reserves for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs that were established in the allocations of the eoc and reform acquisition costs 
the remainder was charged to expense  including million in and million in in connection with the plans initiated in  milacron recorded pretax restructuring costs related to continuing operations of million in compared to million in cash costs for the restructuring actions and the integration of eoc and reform were million in in the aggregate  the actions initiated in are generating over million in annualized cost savings  most of which were realized in in the third quarter of  we approved additional restructuring plans for the purpose of further reducing the company s cost structure in certain businesses and to reduce corporate costs as a result of the dispositions of widia  werk and valenite 
these actions resulted in third quarter restructuring expenses of million 
in november   we announced additional restructuring initiatives intended to improve operating efficiency and customer service 
the first action involves the transfer of all manufacturing of container blow molding machines and structural foam systems from the plant in manchester  michigan to our more modern and efficient facility near cincinnati  ohio 
the mold making operation in manchester will also be moved to a smaller  more cost effective location near the existing facility 
in the second initiative  the manufacture of special mold bases for injection molding at the monterey park  california plant is being phased out and transferred to various other facilities in north america 
these additional actions are expected to result in incremental restructuring costs of to million  of which million was charged to expense in with the remainder to be recorded in the total cash cost of these initiatives is expected to be approximately million  most of which will be spent in the pretax annualized cost savings are expected to exceed million  most of which will be realized in early in  the company initiated a plan for the further restructuring of its european blow molding machinery operations at a cost of up to million 
additional restructuring actions at other locations may be announced later in the year 
the cost of all of these actions  including an additional to million to complete the actions initiated in that are discussed in the preceding paragraph  could total to million in results by segment machinery technologies north america in  the machinery technologies north america segment had orders and sales of million and million  respectively 
in  the segment s orders totaled million and sales were million 
while new business and shipment levels remained low for much of the year due to depressed capital spending levels in the plastics processing industry  volume increased modestly in the fourth quarter 
despite lower sales volume  the segment s manufacturing margin improved in as a result of our cost reduction and restructuring efforts 
after deducting restructuring costs of million  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to an operating loss of million in which includes restructuring costs of million 
excluding restructuring  the segment s operating profit was million in compared to a loss of million in the amounts for include the previously discussed million of royalty income 
goodwill amortization expense included in the amounts totaled million 
machinery technologies europe new orders were million in  an increase of million in relation to the prior year that was due principally to favorable currency effects 
sales decreased from million to million despite favorable currency effects 
manufacturing margins also decreased slightly in including a credit of 
million related to the reversal of excess restructuring reserves that had been accrued in  the segment had an operating loss of million in compared to a loss of million in the amount for includes restructuring costs of million and goodwill amortization expense of million 
excluding restructuring costs  the segment s loss was million in compared to a loss of million in results for continued to be penalized by operating problems related to the consolidation of the segment s european blow molding systems business that was completed in mold technologies the mold technologies segment had new orders of million in  a decrease of million in relation to orders of million in sales also decreased by million from million to million 
the decreases were due in part to low levels of industrial production and capacity utilization in the north american plastics industry but order levels and shipments also decreased in the segment s european operations 
due to reduced volume  the segment s manufacturing margin decreased by approximately one percentage point 
including restructuring costs of million  the segment had an operating loss of million in compared to an operating profit of million in which is net of restructuring costs of million 
excluding restructuring  the segment had an operating profit of million in compared to million in the prior year 
the margin decrease and reduction in profitability were due principally to costs and inefficiencies related to the integration of eoc and reform see acquisitions with the segment s existing european mold base business 
the amounts for include a fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge of million related to a small business unit in the segment 
goodwill amortization expense in was million 
industrial fluids in the industrial fluids segment  new orders and sales both increased from million in to 
table of contents million in approximately one half of the increases resulted from favorable currency effects 
the segment s manufacturing margin decreased only modestly but its operating profit fell from million  which excludes 
million of restructuring costs  to million in the profitability decrease resulted principally from the absence of one time favorable adjustments in that did not recur in expense for goodwill amortization in was 
million 
loss before income taxes milacron s pretax loss in was million compared to a loss of million in the amount includes restructuring costs of million  partially offset by the previously discussed million of royalty income 
the amount for includes goodwill amortization expense of million  million of restructuring costs and the million land sale gain 
excluding all of these items  the company s loss for was million compared to a loss of million in income taxes during  milacron recorded a net benefit related to income taxes due to the combined effects of operating losses in the us and a favorable effective tax rate for non us operations 
the losses incurred by our non us operations resulted in tax benefits based on the federal statutory rate and the company s effective tax rate for state and local tax purposes  in both cases adjusted for permanent differences and applicable credits 
the favorable tax rate for non us operations was due in part to permanent deductions in the netherlands partially offset by increases in valuation allowances as discussed below in germany and italy 
the consolidated effective tax rate also benefited from the favorable resolution of tax contingencies related to the us and other jurisdictions 
milacron entered both and with significant net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions along with valuation allowances against the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and revised based on a more likely than not assessment of whether the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
increases or decreases in these valuation allowances serve to unfavorably or favorably impact our effective tax rate 
loss from continuing operations milacron s loss from continuing operations was million  or 
per share  compared to a loss of million  or 
per share  in after excluding after tax restructuring costs of million and after tax royalty income of million  the loss for was million 
the loss from continuing operations for includes after tax goodwill amortization expense of million  after tax restructuring costs of million  and the after tax land sale gain of million 
excluding these items  the loss for was million 
discontinued operations the company s discontinued operations valenite  widia  werk  grinding wheels and round metalcutting tools had combined losses from operations of million  or 
per share  in compared to losses of million  or 
per share  in the adverse comparison to resulted from depressed levels of industrial production in north america  europe and india as well as inefficiencies associated with managing businesses in the process of being sold 
as described more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in discontinued operations includes a net gain of million that resulted from a gain of million on the sale of valenite and a benefit of million from adjustments of reserves related to the divestiture of the company s machine tools segment 
these amounts were partially offset by losses on the sale of widia and werk of million and on the planned dispositions of the round metalcutting tools and grinding wheels businesses totaling million 
the latter amount was recorded as a charge to earnings in the fourth quarter 
the amounts for the valenite and the widia and werk transactions have been revised in the fourth quarter from the amounts previously recognized to reflect final purchase price adjustments and to adjust reserves and tax effects to reflect more recent estimates of expected liabilities or benefits 
cumulative effect of change in method of accounting effective january   milacron recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million after tax or per share as the cumulative effect of a change in method of accounting in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
approximately of the pretax charge related to the company s uniloy and round metalcutting tools businesses  the latter of which is now reported as a discontinued operation 
the amount of the charge was larger than originally anticipated due principally to higher than expected appraisal values for certain tangible and intangible assets of the mold technologies segment 
net loss including the effects of discontinued operations and the change in method of accounting  milacron had a net loss of million  or per share  in compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in compared to new orders and sales consolidated new orders for continuing operations were million in  a decrease of million  or  in relation to the prior year 
sales also decreased by from million in to million in adverse currency effects reduced reported new orders and sales by million and million  respectively  while acquisitions contributed million of incremental orders and 
table of contents million of sales 
orders and sales for operations in north america were penalized by low levels of industrial production and depressed levels of capital spending for plastics processing machinery 
while order levels and sales decreased to a lesser degree in europe  economic conditions in that region began to soften in the second half of the year 
export orders decreased from million in to million in and export sales fell from million to million 
both decreases resulted principally from lower export demand for us built plastics processing machinery 
sales of all segments to non us markets totaled million both in and for and  products manufactured outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively  while products sold outside the us approximated and of sales  respectively 
at december   milacron s backlog of unfilled orders was million compared to million at december  margins  costs and expenses including restructuring costs related to product line discontinuation  the consolidated manufacturing margin for was compared to in excluding restructuring costs  the consolidated manufacturing margin was 
lower sales volume and the related underabsorption of manufacturing costs penalized the margins of all segments  but especially the results of the machinery technologies north america segment 
these effects became more acute in the second half of the year 
in response to the general economic slowdown  we continued to reduce production costs to meet lower levels of demand and implemented stringent cost reduction measures throughout our operations 
in the first two quarters of  we eliminated more than positions in north america in response to lower order and shipment levels 
during the third and fourth quarters  we announced plans to further reduce our cost structure and break even point by consolidating a number of smaller manufacturing facilities and further reducing general overhead levels see restructuring costs 
these actions in are in addition to the programs to improve operating efficiency that were initiated in and completed in we also began making structural improvements in the way we run our businesses  including the use of six sigma and lean manufacturing techniques throughout our operations to reduce cycle times and working capital requirements 
for  total selling and administrative expense decreased in dollar amount due to reduced variable selling expenses and the aggressive cost reduction measures implemented in recent years 
as a percentage of sales  however  selling expense increased from to due in part to modestly higher expense for bad debts 
administrative expense decreased by almost due principally to the benefits derived from the aforementioned cost reduction programs 
other expense net totaled million in compared to million in the amount for includes a pretax gain of million million after tax on the sale of surplus real estate while the amount for includes million million after tax of revenue from the licensing of patented plastics processing technology 
for  net interest expense related to continuing operations increased despite a general reduction in short term interest rates 
substantially all of the interest expense attributable to the company s revolving credit facility has been allocated to discontinued operations due to mandatory debt repayments using the divestiture proceeds 
as a result  interest on fixed rate debt represents a higher percentage of interest expense in continuing operations in than was the case in restructuring costs in  we initiated two separate programs to improve operating efficiency and strengthen synergies between certain recently acquired businesses and our previously existing operations 
the first program involved the consolidation of our european blow molding operations into a new manufacturing facility located near milan  italy at a cost of million 
in the fourth quarter of we initiated a second plan to improve operating efficiency and reduce costs at additional businesses through the closure of three smaller manufacturing plants and the elimination of approximately manufacturing overhead and administrative positions at a total cost of million 
completion of these plans in resulted in charges to earnings from continuing operations of million in that year 
as discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in the third and fourth quarters of we formally approved plans to consolidate additional operations and further reduce the company s cost structure at a cost of million 
of the total cost of the plans  million was recorded in  including reserves totaling million for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs  
million for supplemental retirement benefits to be funded through the company s principal us pension plan  and million for product line discontinuation and certain other inventory writedowns 
the plans involved the closure of four manufacturing facilities and several sales and administrative locations and the elimination of approximately manufacturing and administrative positions 
the cash cost of implementing these plans was million 
during  we also approved a plan to integrate the operations of eoc and reform with our existing mold base and components business in europe at a cost of million which includes reserves for employee termination benefits and facility exit costs of million that were established in the allocations of the respective acquisition costs 
the remainder was charged to expense  including million in cash costs of the integration in totaled million 

table of contents results by segment machinery technologies north america the machinery technologies north america segment had orders of million and sales of million in compared to orders of million and sales of million in low levels of industrial production in north america resulted in significantly reduced demand for the segment s plastics machinery products which represent a substantial portion of its sales revenues 
the segment s manufacturing margin also decreased due to underabsorption of manufacturing costs despite major cost reduction and downsizing initiatives 
principally as a result of decreased volume  the segment had a operating loss of million which includes million of restructuring costs 
excluding restructuring  the segment s loss in was million compared to earnings of million in which is net of 
million of restructuring costs and includes the previously discussed million of royalty income 
machinery technologies europe in  the machinery technologies europe segment had orders of million  a decrease of in relation to orders of million 
the segment s sales decreased from million in to million in  or approximately 
the decreases in relation to the prior year were due in part to adverse currency effects and increasingly soft economic conditions in europe in the second half of the year 
consistent with the decrease in sales and orders  manufacturing margins decreased and the segment had an operating loss of million in compared to operating earnings of million in the segment s restructuring costs were million in and 
million in excluding these amounts  the loss for was million compared to earnings of million in problems arising from the eighteen month long reorganization of the segment s blow molding machinery operations  which was completed in  contributed to the adverse margin and earnings comparisons 
as previously discussed  these problems continued into mold technologies the mold technologies segment had new orders of million in compared to orders of million in the segment s sales were million in and million in the decreases occurred despite the contributions of the acquisitions of eoc and reform see acquisitions and resulted principally from lower levels of industrial production and capacity utilization in the plastics processing industry in north america 
adverse currency effects also contributed to the decreases 
the segment s manufacturing margin decreased by approximately five percentage points due to reduced volume 
including restructuring costs of million  the segment had operating earnings of million in compared to earnings of million in excluding restructuring costs  the segment s operating earnings decreased from million in to million in industrial fluids orders for industrial fluids decreased from million in to million in while the segment s sales decreased from million to million 
the decreases occurred principally in north america due to reduced levels of industrial production 
manufacturing margins decreased modestly but the segment s operating profit increased from million to million as a result of favorable one time adjustments 
excluding restructuring costs of 
million the segment s earnings for were million 
earnings loss before income taxes for  milacron s loss before income taxes was million compared to earnings of million in the amount for includes restructuring costs of million compared to million in excluding restructuring  milacron s pretax loss was million compared to earnings of million in the same factors that caused the significant reductions in order levels and sales low levels of industrial production and significantly lower levels of capital spending in the plastics processing industry were the principal reasons for the adverse comparison to income taxes during  milacron recorded a net benefit related to income taxes due to the combined effects of operating losses in the us and an unfavorable effective tax rate for non us operations 
the losses incurred by our us operations resulted in tax benefits based on the federal statutory rate and the company s effective tax rate for state and local tax purposes  in both cases adjusted for permanent differences and applicable credits 
the unfavorable tax rate for non us operations was due in part to increases in valuation allowances as discussed below which was partially offset by a favorable ruling from a non us tax authority and the resolution of tax contingencies in other jurisdictions 
milacron entered both and with significant net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions  along with valuation allowances against the carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and revised based on a more likely than not assessment of whether the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
increases or decreases in these valuation allowances serve to unfavorably or favorably affect our effective tax rate 
milacron s effective tax rate for was less than the federal statutory rate due principally to reductions of valuation allowances and to favorable rulings from various taxing authorities

the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
at december   milacron had outstanding forward contracts totaling million compared to million at december  the annual potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material at either date 
interest rate risk at december   milacron s continuing operations had fixed interest rate debt of million  including million of notes due march   and million million of eurobonds due april  
table of contents we also had floating rate debt totaling million  with interest fluctuating based primarily on changes in libor 
at december   fixed rate debt related to continuing operations totaled million  and floating rate debt totaled million 
we can also sell up to million million effective january  of accounts receivable under our receivables purchase agreement which results in financing fees that fluctuate based on changes in commercial paper rates 
as a result  annual interest expense and financing fees fluctuate based on changes in short term borrowing rates 
the potential annual loss on floating rate debt from a hypothetical increase in interest rates would be approximately 
million at december  and million at december  liquidity and sources of capital at december   milacron had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million since december  as of december   milacron s current ratio related to continuing operations was compared to at december  in  operating activities provided million cash compared to a million use of cash in the generation of cash in was due principally to our aggressive working capital management initiatives which included programs to further reduce inventories 
the amount for includes the negative effects of a million reduction of the amount of accounts receivable sold under our receivables purchase agreement 
however  cash flow from operations in benefited from reductions in accounts receivable in the normal course of business due to lower sales volume and from significant reductions in inventories that were achieved through our working capital reduction plan 
investing activities provided million of cash in due almost entirely to the proceeds from the sales of valenite  widia and werk 
in  investing activities used million of cash  including million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
in  financing activities used million of cash due to repayments of borrowings under lines of credit using the divestiture proceeds and cash provided by operations 
financing activities provided million of cash in due to net additional borrowings of million  the effects of which were partially offset by dividends of million 
total shareholders equity was million at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease resulted principally from the million net loss incurred during which includes the million cumulative effect adjustment related to goodwill impairment 
in addition  the company recorded a million after tax minimum pension liability adjustment as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
this adjustment is more fully described above in the section captioned significant accounting policies and judgments 
the company s debt and lease obligations for and beyond are shown in the table that follows 
debt and lease obligations after in millions long term debt and lease obligations revolving credit facility other lines of credit total debt obligations operating leases total debt and lease obligations note the above table excludes contingent liabilities of up to million related to sales of receivables and loan guarantees and million of purchase price adjustments that will be paid to the buyers of valenite  widia and werk in the first quarter of our ability to satisfy our obligations and other liquidity needs is a function of a number of factors  the most important of which include our available cash and cash equivalents  our continued ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and other lines of credit  our ability to continue to utilize our us receivables purchase agreement and other similar arrangements  and our cash flow from operating activities 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
at december   milacron had lines of credit with various us and non us banks totaling approximately million  including a million committed revolving credit facility 
at december   million was drawn against the facility  including outstanding letters of credit of million 
the facility includes a number of financial covenants and at december   was scheduled to mature on december  as discussed below  the facility was amended in february  to  among other things  change the maturity date to march  
table of contents effective december  the revolving credit facility was amended to  among other things  reduce the commitment amount from million to million in connection with a reorganization of our round metalcutting tools business in anticipation of its expected sale 
the current agreement includes covenants  including those which i require the company to achieve specified minimum levels of quarterly cumulative ebitda and ii limit the incurrence of new debt 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
the company had million of cash at december  and the ability to borrow an additional million for general corporate purposes under the revolving credit facility 
the company could also borrow approximately million under existing lines of credit other than the facility 
the facility also allows over million of additional indebtedness from other sources 
effective february   the revolving credit facility was amended to  among other things  reduce the facility to million reflecting a reduction in projected cash requirements for in addition to a reduction in the four quarter cumulative trailing ebitda covenant and suspension of the leverage test for all of  the amended agreement requires further permanent reductions in the facility on june   september  and december  to million  million and million  respectively 
the maturity date of the facility was changed from december  to march  for  the company s significant cost cutting actions coupled with an expected modest  gradual improvement in business conditions cause us to believe that operating earnings will continue to increase  which should allow us to continue to meet the covenants 
however  if unforeseen market conditions develop or the company is otherwise unable to meet the covenants  it is possible that it would not be in compliance 
in that event  we would attempt to renegotiate the covenants with the bank group to assure compliance 
however  our lenders actions are not controllable by us and if the renegotiations were not successful  the company could be placed in default under the agreement  which would allow the lenders to declare the outstanding borrowings currently due and payable 
in addition  due to cross default provisions in milacron s other agreements  over of our other debt could become payable in full and our receivables purchase program as discussed below could be terminated if we were in default under the credit facility 
were these events to occur  we would experience a material adverse impact on our reported liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  as of december  we had a number of other credit lines totaling million  of which approximately million was available for future borrowing 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility as amended  increases in debt are primarily limited to current lines of credit and certain other indebtedness from other sources 
milacron s debt and credit are rated by standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s 
on october   moody s announced it had lowered milacron s senior implied and senior secured rating one notch from ba with a negative outlook to b with a stable outlook and milacron s senior unsecured rating one notch from b with a negative outlook to b with a stable outlook 
on november   s p announced it had lowered milacron s corporate credit rating to b from bb with a negative outlook 
at the same time  the rating on the company s senior secured bank facility was lowered to b from bb 
milacron s senior unsecured debt was affirmed at b 
none of the company s debt instruments include rating triggers that would accelerate maturity or increase interest rates 
accordingly  the rating changes are expected to have no significant short term effect  although they could potentially affect the types and cost of credit facilities and debt instruments available to the company in the future 
another important source of liquidity is our accounts receivable purchase program 
although the agreement could be terminated upon the occurrence of certain events  some of which may be beyond our control  we expect to continue to be able to use the program at least through december  at december   million of the million facility was utilized 
of the total amount utilized  approximately million relates to the grinding wheels and round metalcutting tools businesses that are being treated as discontinued operations 
the amount available to the company was reduced to million effective january  and will be further reduced by million effective with each of the disposals of the company s grinding wheels and round metalcutting tools businesses 
as the amount of eligible accounts receivable increases due to improved business conditions  we expect to be able to utilize the remaining amounts available under the facility 
milacron expects to generate positive cash flow from operating activities during  which will be partially offset by up to million for capital expenditures 
assuming there is no further significant deterioration in the markets we serve  we believe that milacron s current cash position  cash flow from operations  available credit lines and capacity to sell receivables will be sufficient to meet the company s operating and capital requirements in cautionary statement milacron wishes to caution readers about all of the forward looking statements in the management s discussion and analysis section and elsewhere 
these include all statements that speak about the future or are based on our interpretation of factors that might affect our businesses 
milacron believes the following important factors  among others  could affect its actual results in and beyond and cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements global and regional economic conditions  consumer
