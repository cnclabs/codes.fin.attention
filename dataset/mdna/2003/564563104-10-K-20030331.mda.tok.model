item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discontinued operations and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect  under the heading discontinued operations  the company s estimate of the net losses it expected from these operations through the date it estimated they would be disposed  and all losses expected to be realized upon the disposal of these operations 
subsequent to the disposal of these businesses  the company may continue to be exposed to some liabilities arising from their prior operations 
for example  the company is involved in a lawsuit alleging that it caused or contributed to soil and groundwater contamination 
for more information on this lawsuit  see item legal proceedings 
the operations from this subsidiary  the company s former environmental consulting and remediation business  particularly the performance of environmental consulting and remediation services  may not have been or in the future may not be conducted in compliance with environmental laws  exposing the company to further liability and damages for the costs of investigating and cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
the company cannot assure you that its liability in these matters  or any other environmental liabilities that arise in the future  will not exceed its resources or will be covered by insurance 
even though the company has disposed of this and the other four discontinued operations  it likely will remain liable for any costs  damages or other liabilities imposed upon them that result from or relate to their operations prior to the disposition 
the company may be affected by intellectual property infringement claims 
the company s business operations rely extensively on procuring and deploying intellectual property 
the company s employees develop some of the software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that the company uses to provide information technology solutions to its customers  but it also licenses technology from primary vendors 
typically  under federal government contracts  the company s government customers may claim rights in the intellectual property the company develops  making it impossible for the company to prevent their future use of the company s intellectual property 
the company is and may in the future be subject to claims from its employees or third parties who assert that software solutions and other forms of intellectual property that the company used in delivering services and solutions to the company s customers infringe upon intellectual property rights of such employees or third parties 
if the company s vendors  the company s employees or third parties assert claims that the company or the company s customers are infringing on their intellectual property  the company could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
in addition  if any of these infringement claims are ultimately successful  the company could be required to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  obtain a license or additional licenses  or redesign the company s products and services that rely on the challenged software or technology 
covenants in the company s credit facility may restrict the company s financial and operating flexibility 
the company s credit facility contains covenants that limit or restrict  among other things  the company s ability to borrow money outside of the amounts committed under the credit facility  make investments in certain of its subsidiaries that are borrowers under the credit facility and designated as discontinued operations or in other entities not listed as borrowers under the credit facility  make other restricted payments  pay dividends on the company s common stock  sell or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business  merge or consolidate  or make acquisitions  in each case without the prior written consent of the company s lenders 
the company s credit facility also requires the company to maintain specified financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage  interest coverage  debt coverage  and minimum consolidated net worth 
the company s ability to satisfy these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control  and the company cannot assure you that it will meet these ratios 
for example  on two occasions in the past five years  in march and in november  the company obtained waivers for failure to maintain the required fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of the preceding quarters under the credit facility that was in effect at that time 
default under the company s credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
the company has pledged substantially all of its assets  including the stock of certain of the company s subsidiaries  to secure the debt under the company s credit facility 
if the lenders declare amounts outstanding under the credit facility to be due  the lenders could proceed against those assets 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business if the creditors determine to exercise their rights 
the company also may incur future debt obligations that might subject the company to restrictive covenants that could affect its financial and operational flexibility  restrict the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or subject the company to other events of default 
any such restrictive covenants in any future debt obligations the company incurs could limit the company s ability to fund its businesses with equity investments or intercompany advances  which would impede the company s ability to operate or expand its business 
from time to time the company may require consents or waivers from its lenders to permit actions that are prohibited by its credit facility 
if in the future the company s lenders refuse to provide waivers of the company s credit facility s restrictive covenants and or financial ratios  then the company may be in default under its credit facility  and the company may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain and expand its business 
the company s employees or subcontractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities 
the company is exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur 
in addition  from time to time the company enters into arrangements with subcontractors and joint venture partners to bid on and execute particular contracts or programs and it is exposed to the risk that fraud or other misconduct or improper activities by such persons may occur 
misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could include intentional failures to comply with federal laws  federal government procurement regulations or the terms of contracts that the company receives and failing to disclose unauthorized or unsuccessful activities to the company  which could lead to civil  criminal  and or administrative penalties including fines  imprisonment  suspension and or debarment from performing federal government contracts and reputational harm 
misconduct by the company s employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could also involve the improper collection  handling or use of the company s customers sensitive or classified information  which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to the company s reputation 
the company has from time to time experienced occurrences of misconduct and improper activities by its employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
it is not always possible to deter misconduct by the company s employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners 
under certain circumstances  conduct of the company s employees can be imputed to the mantech subsidiary for which they work and the conduct of mantech subsidiaries can be imputed to mantech international corporation with the consequence that mantech international corporation could be subject to sanctions and penalties for actions taken by its subsidiaries and or the employees of its subsidiaries 
the precautions the company takes to prevent and detect such activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses and such misconduct by employees  subcontractors or joint venture partners could result in serious civil or criminal penalties or sanctions or reputational harm to the company

like most large government defense contractors  the company s contract costs are audited and reviewed on a continual basis by an in house staff of auditors from the defense contract auditing agency 
in addition to these routine audits  the company is subject from time to time to audits and investigations by other agencies of the federal government 
these audits and investigations are conducted to determine if the company s performance and administration of its government contracts are compliant with contractual requirements and applicable federal statutes and regulations 
an audit or investigation may result in a finding that the company s performance and administration is compliant or  alternatively  may result in the government initiating proceedings against the company or its employees  including administrative proceedings seeking repayment of monies  suspension and or debarment from doing business with the federal government or a particular agency  or civil or criminal proceedings seeking penalties and or fines 
audits and investigations conducted by the federal government frequently span several years

on august   the company was served with a grand jury subpoena issued by the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia 
the us attorney s office for the eastern district of virginia has advised the company that the investigation relates to whether the company improperly charged a portion of its corporate merger and acquisition related expenses and certain expenses of its australian based software consulting subsidiary which is one of the company s businesses included in discontinued operations in a manner that would have resulted in those expenses being reimbursed by the us government 
as anticipated  the company received a second grand jury subpoena seeking documents relating to this investigation on august  based on the facts known to the company as of the date of this annual report  the company does not expect the consequences of this investigation to have a material adverse effect on its business  prospects  financial condition or operating results

the subpoena seeks the production of certain documents concerning a department of defense contract pursuant to which one of the company s subsidiaries  mantech solutions technologies corporation mstc  performed personnel security clearance background checks for the defense security service 
although the company did not handle classified information under this contract  the terms of the contract required mstc to utilize personnel with appropriate security clearances 
the company believes that the investigation relates  in part  to whether it improperly charged certain costs under the contract  as well as to the propriety of the security clearances and credentials of certain subcontractors and employees who provided services under the contract 
after receiving this subpoena  the company s outside counsel and the company s chief compliance officer began an investigation of mstc regarding certain matters relevant to the subpoena 
in the course of the company s internal investigation  which remains in process  the company discovered that up to five weekly time sheets of one person who performed services under the contract and who did not possess the proper security clearance had been manually changed after receipt of the subpoena and before they were produced to the department of defense office of inspector general to indicate that such person did not directly charge time to the contract 
none of the changed information was entered into the company s official accounting records  and  therefore  the information in the company s accounting system was not compromised 
the company promptly informed the government of this development  and it terminated certain employees of mstc following its discovery relating to the changed time sheets 
the company notes that this development may result in proceedings against certain current and or former employees of mstc and possibly mstc itself 
based on the facts known to the company  the company does not expect the consequences of the government s investigation to have a material adverse effect on its business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
however  this investigation is at a preliminary stage and it is not possible to tell how it may develop in the future

the company also is currently subject to an investigation by the inspector general of the epa originating from a subpoena received in march of regarding the number of hours the company charged in the performance of a contract with the epa 
the company does not believe that the outcome of this investigation will have a material adverse effect on its business  prospects  financial condition or operating results 
the company is fully cooperating with the federal government s investigation of this matter 
in addition to the foregoing  the company is subject to certain other legal proceedings  investigations  claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of its business 
although the company cannot predict the outcomes of these other legal proceedings  investigations  claims and disputes  based on the information now available to it  the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its business  prospects  financial condition or operating results

critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and cost estimation the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company has a standard internal process that it uses to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
this standard internal process includes a monthly review of contract revenues and expenses by several levels of management 
this review covers  among other matters  progress against schedule  project staffing and levels of effort  risks and issues  subcontract management  incurred and estimated costs  and disposition of prior action items 
this monthly internal review is designed to determine whether the overall progress on a contract is consistent with the effort expended and revenue recognized to date 
the company s revenues consist primarily of payments for the work of the company s employees  and to a lesser extent  the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with the company s customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation  and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
the majority of the company s revenues are derived from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price  or time and materials contracts 
absent evidence to the contrary  the company recognizes revenue as follows 
under cost plus fixed or award fee contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred and include an estimate of applicable fees earned 
under firm fixed price contracts  revenues are estimated on the percentage of completion method  on the basis of costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs  or upon delivery of specific products or services  as appropriate 
for time and material contracts  revenues are computed by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
performance incentives are incorporated in certain contracts  which provide increased and decreased revenues based on actual performance compared to established targets 
incentives based upon cost performance are recorded when earned and other incentives and awards are recorded when the amounts are earned and can be reasonably determined  or are awarded 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 
prior to agreeing to commence work directed by the customer and before receipt of the written modification or amendment to the existing contract  the company requires the completion of an internal memo that assesses the probability of the modification being executed in a timely fashion and the company s ability to subsequently collect payment from the customer 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of the company s progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of the company s standard management processes  facts develop that require the company to revise its estimated total costs or revenues 
in most cases  these revisions relate to changes in the contractual scope of the company s work 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  the company records the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known
