item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein 
overview our primary sources of revenue are net interest income and servicing income 
net interest income is the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the primary components of servicing income include late charges and other collection related fee income on managed contracts  retained interest income or expense  and contractual specified servicing income on contracts in securitization transactions treated as sales for accounting purposes and whole loan sales 
the primary components of operating expenses are salaries  credit and collection expenses and data processing costs 
critical accounting policies management believes critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require difficult and complex judgments because they rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the impact of changing market conditions 
the following is a summary of accounting policies we consider critical 
retained interest in securitized assets automobile contract asset backed securitization transactions are treated as either sales or secured financings for accounting purposes depending upon the securitization structure 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  also known as the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  also known as sfas no 
 to replace statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  also known as sfas no 
sfas no 
revises the standards for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral and requires certain disclosures  but it generally carries over most of sfas no 
s provisions without reconsideration 
sfas no 
defines the criteria used to evaluate securitization structures in determining the proper accounting treatment 
these criteria pertain to whether or not the transferor has surrendered control over the transferred assets 
if a securitization transaction meets all the criteria defined in sfas no 
 the transaction is required to be treated as a sale 
if any one of the criteria is not met  the transaction is required to be treated as a secured financing 
since march   our securitization transactions included certain provisions which allow us to effectively maintain control over the transferred assets 
as a result  these securitization transactions are required to be treated as secured financings 
our securitization transactions prior to march  did not give us this right and  therefore  we were required to treat such transactions as sales 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows on a cash out basis  net of the write off of dealer participation and gains or losses on hedges 
we determined whether or not we must record a servicing asset or liability by estimating future servicing revenues  including servicing fees  late charges  other ancillary income and float benefit  less the actual cost to service the loans 
in determining the fair value of our retained interest in securitized assets  also known as risa  we evaluated the cost basis of contracts relative to the fair value of such contracts and the fair value of the risa recorded 
the risa was capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the underlying contracts 
net interest income and servicing fees earned on these contracts are recognized over the life of the securitization transactions as contractual servicing income  retained interest income and fee income 
the amortization of the risa is calculated so as to recognize retained interest income on an effective yield basis 
these amounts are reported as servicing income on our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents risa is classified in a manner similar to available for sale securities and as such was marked to market each quarter 
market value changes were calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the current market discount rate 
any changes in the market value of the risa were reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluated the carrying value of the risa in light of the actual performance of the underlying contracts and made adjustments to reduce the carrying value  if appropriate 
for securitization transactions treated as secured financings  the contracts are retained on the balance sheet with the securities issued to finance the contracts recorded as notes payable on automobile secured financing 
we record interest income on the securitized contracts and interest expense on the notes issued through the securitization transactions 
the excess cash flows generated by securitized contracts are deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitization transactions 
in addition  we advance additional monies to initially fund these spread accounts 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  amounts due to us held in the spread accounts and servicing income earned by us for which we have not yet received repayment from the trust are reported as amounts due from trust on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
as servicer of these contracts  we hold and remit funds collected from the borrowers on behalf of the trustee pursuant to reinvestment contracts that we have entered into 
for securitization transactions treated as sales  these amounts are reported as amounts held on behalf of trustee on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
allowance for credit losses management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on a review of various quantitative and qualitative analyses 
quantitative analyses include the review of chargeoff trends by contract program and contract type on an owned and managed basis  analysis of cumulative losses on both a managed and sold basis and evaluation of credit loss experience by credit tier and geographic location 
other quantitative analyses include the evaluation of the size of any particular asset group  the concentration of any credit tier  the level of nonperformance and the percentage of delinquency 
qualitative analyses include trends in chargeoffs over various time periods and at various statistical midpoints and high points  the severity of depreciated values of repossessions  trends in the number of days repossessions are held in inventory  trends in the number of contract modifications  trends in delinquency roll rates  trends in deficiency balance collections both internally and from collection agencies  trends in custom scores and the effectiveness of our custom scores and trends in the economy generally or in specific geographic locations 
despite these analyses  we recognize that establishing allowance for credit losses is not an exact science and can be highly judgmental in nature 
the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is not only dependent upon effective quantitative and qualitative analyses  but also effective contract review and asset classification 
we classify our assets in accordance with regulatory guidance into five categories pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
based upon our asset classifications  we establish general and specific valuation allowances 
general valuation allowances are determined by applying various factors to loan balances that are classified as pass  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
specific valuation allowances represent contracts that are classified as loss 
some assets may be split into more than one asset classification due to fair value or net realizable value calculations 
this approach allows for enhanced analysis as it highlights the need for more allowance than would be generally allocated if held in one classification 
all contracts that are to days delinquent are automatically classified as special mention 
any contract that is or more days delinquent is automatically classified as substandard 
any contract where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or the vehicle has been repossessed by us and is subject to a redemption period is classified as substandard  with the difference between the wholesale book value and contract balance classified as loss 

table of contents the allowance for credit losses is reduced by net chargeoffs as well as decreases in required allowances due to sales of contracts and by lowering the level of required reserves based upon improved contract performance 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by recording amounts to the provision for credit losses 
derivatives and hedging activities the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we may enter into various hedge agreements prior to closing the transaction 
the market value of these hedge agreements is designed to respond inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization transaction  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization transaction is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
if we issue certain variable rate notes payable in connection with our securitization activities  we may also enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  also known as sfas no 
 or that we choose not to designate as hedges 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives is recorded to noninterest income each month 
any income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recognized as miscellaneous noninterest income or expense 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is affected by the difference between the rate earned on our interest earning assets and the rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and the relative amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income in is primarily the result of us holding a greater percentage of contracts on balance sheet as we utilized the liquidity sources provided by our parent and completed public securitizations totaling approximately billion and a conduit financing totaling million that were accounted for as secured financings 
our decision to account for our securitizations as secured financings by changing the structure of our securitizations was based upon a business philosophy that focuses on presenting high quality  cash based earnings and maintaining a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
in order to defeat sale treatment  some of our securitization transactions include a provision that provides us with the right to repurchase contracts at our option 
the percentage of contracts that we could repurchase was increased from to as of march other securitization transactions allow the trust to invest in other financial assets 
we 
table of contents believe that a presentation in which assets and liabilities remain on the balance sheet for securitization transactions treated as secured financings provides a better understanding of our business and the inherent risks associated with our securitizations 
in addition  by accounting for our securitizations as secured financings we no longer record a retained interest asset upon completion of each securitization  the valuation of which is based upon subjective assumptions

the total interest rate spread decreased basis points in compared with due to a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points and a decrease in the cost of funds of basis points 
the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets is primarily due to our shift to originating a higher percentage of prime credit quality contracts originated and a lower interest rate environment 
the decrease in the cost of funds in and is primarily due to a lower interest rate environment

if there is no balance in the previous year  the total change is allocated to volume 
servicing income since the first quarter of  we have not completed a securitization that has been accounted for as a sale 
for transactions treated as sales prior to april  we recorded a non cash gain equal to the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the portfolio of contracts sold less the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
for these securitizations  net interest earned on the contracts sold are recognized over the life of the transactions as contractual servicing income and retained interest income or expense 
we occasionally sell contracts to westcorp in whole loan sales 
these sales are designed to utilize additional capital raised by westcorp 
these contracts are subsequently securitized by westcorp and continue to be managed by us under the terms of such securitizations 
we recognize a cash gain on a whole loan sale equal to the cash premium received adjusted for the write off of dealer participation balances and the effect of hedging activities 
the components of servicing income were as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands fee income contractual servicing income retained interest expense income  net of risa amortization total servicing income servicing income decreased primarily as a result of decreases in contractual servicing income and higher retained interest expense  offset by increases in other fee income 

table of contents fee income consists primarily of documentation fees  late charges and deferment fees on our managed portfolio  including contracts securitized in transactions accounted for as sales and secured financings  as well as contracts sold in whole loan sales and contracts not securitized 
the increase in fee income is due to the growth in our average managed portfolio to billion in from billion in and billion in contractual servicing income earned by us from westcorp relating to the whole loan sales totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
according to the terms of each securitization  contractual servicing income is generally earned at rates ranging from to per annum on the outstanding balance of contracts securitized 
for accounting purposes  this income is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
contractual servicing income earned by us relating to sales to securitization trusts totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease from to was a result of the decrease in the average balance of the sold portfolio 
retained interest expense totaled million for the year ended december   compared with retained interest expense of million and retained interest income million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
for accounting purposes  this income or expense is only recognized on contracts sold through securitizations treated as sales 
retained interest income or expense is dependent upon the average excess spread on the contracts sold  credit losses and the size of the sold portfolio 
the retained interest expense recognized in is the result of higher chargeoff experience on our sold portfolio as well as revised estimates of future chargeoffs due to continued slowing in the economy 
net chargeoffs on the sold portfolio decreased to million in from million in and million in the outstanding sold portfolio had a weighted average gross interest rate spread of in compared with and in and  respectively 
the average balance of the sold portfolio  excluding the loans sold in the whole loan sale on which we do not recognize retained interest income  was million in compared with billion in and billion in

the securitization closed on february  
table of contents provision for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to cover probable losses that can be reasonably estimated for contracts held on the balance sheet 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on such contracts or by reversing the allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses when the amount of contracts held on balance sheet is reduced from securitization transactions treated as sales and from whole loan sales 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held on balance sheet and historical loss trends 
we believe that the allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to absorb probable losses in our owned portfolio that can be reasonably estimated 
the provision for credit losses was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net chargeoffs were million  million and million for the same respective periods 
the increase in the provision for credit losses is the result of a greater amount of contracts held on balance sheet as well as higher credit losses due to slowing in the economy 
operating expenses operating expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared with in and in operating expenses as a percentage of average managed contracts declined to in compared with in and in as the result of operating efficiencies achieved through the centralization and automation of certain processes as well as the deployment of new technologies 
the efficiencies realized include increasing the conversion ratios on contracts purchased through dealer education  automating the loan application and underwriting system  increasing the percentage of applications received via the internet  outsourcing the data entry process  centralizing the verification process  and implementing proprietary credit scorecards and electronic funds transfers for our dealers 
operating efficiencies also include implementing automated dialers  centralizing and upgrading payment processing and asset recovery processes  upgrading toll free lines for customer service and interactive voice response technology  implementing direct debit for our borrowers  imaging for record retention and retrieval  and implementing a new behavioral scoring collection system 
currently  we pay a monthly management fee to the bank and westcorp  which covers various administrative expenses 
additionally  the bank and westcorp pay fees to us for information technology and other services 
the management fee is based on the actual costs incurred and estimates of actual usage 
we believe that the management fee approximates the cost to perform these services on our own behalf or to acquire them from third parties 
we have the option  under the management agreements  to procure these services on our own should it be more economically beneficial for us to do so 
see business transactions with related parties management agreements 
income taxes we file federal and certain state tax returns as part of a consolidated group that includes the bank and westcorp 
we file other state tax returns as a separate entity 
tax liabilities from the consolidated returns are allocated in accordance with a tax sharing agreement based on the relative income or loss of each entity on a stand alone basis 
our effective tax rate was approximately in compared with in and in  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of a one time benefit of new legislation enacted by the state of california which eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debts for large banks and financial corporations for taxable income purposes 
in the first year of this change  of the ending reserve amount deducted from taxable income in prior periods will be included in the current year california taxable income 
the remaining of the reserve is not required to be recaptured into income but rather represents a permanent difference between gaap and california tax accounting 
the deferred tax liability related to this permanent difference has been eliminated from our balance sheet and the current year 
table of contents state income tax provision has been reduced accordingly 
see business transactions with related parties tax sharing agreement 
pro forma portfolio basis statements of income during the first quarter of  we changed the structure of our securitizations so that they would no longer be accounted for as sales but rather recorded as secured financings 
this decision is consistent with our business strategy to record high quality earnings and to maintain a conservative  well capitalized balance sheet 
if treated as secured financings  no gain on sale or subsequent contractual servicing and retained interest income or expense is recognized 
instead  the earnings of the contracts in the trust  including servicing fees  and the related financing costs are reflected over the life of the underlying pool of contracts as net interest income 
additionally  no risa is recorded on the balance sheet  which must be written off over the life of a securitization 
this asset is subject to impairment if assumptions made about the performance of a securitization are not realized 
since  our securitizations that were recorded as sales have matured and an increasing percentage of securitized contracts are represented by securitizations that are accounted for as secured financings 
during the transitory period  we have presented pro forma portfolio basis statements of income that present our results under the assumption that all our outstanding securitizations and whole loan sales to westcorp are treated as secured financings rather than as sales 
these statements provided a method by which to gauge our year to year performance while we made this transition 
effective the first quarter of  we will discontinue presenting portfolio basis earnings since we have completed our transition to treating securitization transactions as secured financings rather than sales for accounting purposes and have fully amortized our residual interest assets 
the growth in our portfolio basis earnings reflects the growth in our managed contract portfolio to billion at december   compared with billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we monitor the periodic portfolio basis earnings of our managed contract portfolio and believe these portfolio basis statements assist in better understanding our business

financial condition overview we originated billion and billion of contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of higher contract originations  our portfolio of managed contracts reached billion at december   up from billion at december  
table of contents amounts due from trusts the excess cash flows generated by contracts sold to each of the securitization trusts are deposited into spread accounts in the name of the trustee under the terms of the securitizations 
in addition  at the time a securitization closes  the bank advances additional monies to our subsidiary that originated the securitization trust to initially fund these spread accounts 
as these spread accounts reach the balances required by the trust  excess amounts are released to us and are used to pay down these amounts 
the amounts due from trusts represent initial advances made to spread accounts and excess cash flows that are still under obligation to be held in the spread accounts for transactions treated as sales 
the amounts due from trusts at december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease is the result of a reduction in the outstanding amount of securitizations treated as sales for accounting purposes 
amounts due from trusts is expected to continue to decline in retained interest in securitized assets none of our securitization transactions in or were treated as sales 
therefore  we did not record any retained interest in securitized assets 
the following table sets forth the components of the risa for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period additions amortization change in unrealized gain loss on risa balance at end of period the change in unrealized gain loss on risa represents temporary changes in valuation including changes in the discount rate based on the current interest rate environment 
such amounts will not be realized unless the risa is sold 
changes in prepayment and credit loss assumptions for the risa are other than temporary in nature and impact the value of the risa 
such other than temporary differences are immediately recognized in income as a component of retained interest income or expense 
there were no restrictions on the risa

table of contents asset quality overview we provide financing in a market where there is a risk of default by borrowers 
chargeoffs directly impact our earnings and cash flows 
to minimize the amount of credit losses we incur  we monitor delinquent accounts  promptly repossess and remarket vehicles  and seek to collect on deficiency balances

table of contents cumulative static pool losses are another means of analyzing contract quality 
the cumulative static pool loss ratio of a securitization is the cumulative amount of losses actually recognized  net of recoveries  as to the contracts securitized  up to and including a given month  divided by the original principal balance of the contracts in that securitization

table of contents allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses was million at december  compared with million at december  we have increased our percentage of allowance for credit losses from at december  to at december  as we have experienced higher losses in our owned portfolio due to a slowing economy 
based on the analyses we performed related to the allowance for credit losses as described under critical accounting polices  we believe that our allowance for credit losses is currently adequate to cover probable losses in our contract portfolio that can be reasonably estimated

our ability to maintain positive cash flows from operations is the result of our consistent managed growth  our ability to manage risk adjusted returns and our efficient operations 
in addition to our indirect statement of cash flows as presented under gaap  we also analyze the key cash flows from our operations on a direct basis excluding certain items such as the purchase or securitization of contracts 
the following table shows our operating cash flows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands cash flows from owned contracts cash flows from off balance sheet trusts contractual servicing income cash gain on sale fee income less dealer participation operating costs operating cash flows operating cash flows improved for compared with and for compared with as a result of the growth in our managed portfolio as well as improved operating efficiencies 

table of contents principal sources of cash collections of principal and interest from contracts our primary source of funds is the collection of principal and interest from contracts originated and securitized  to the extent that the transaction is an on balance sheet transaction 
these monies are deposited into collection accounts established in connection with each securitization  or into our accounts for non securitized contracts 
pursuant to reinvestment contracts entered into in connection with most securitizations  we receive access to the amounts deposited into collection accounts and amounts held in the spread accounts 
we use those amounts so received in our daily operations to fund the purchase of contracts or to cover the day to day costs of our operations 
if delinquency or chargeoff rates in a securitization exceed established triggers  amounts required to be held in spread accounts will increase  requiring additional pledged collateral 
we may bear additional expense due to an increase in required collateral 
if the reinvestment contracts were no longer deemed an eligible investment  which determination would be made by the rating agencies or fsa  we would no longer have the ability to use this cash in the ordinary course of business and would need to obtain alternative financing  which may only be available on less attractive terms 
see business transactions with related parties reinvestment contracts 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would also have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
also  a significant increase in credit losses could have a material adverse impact on our collections of principal and interest from contracts 
principal and interest collections totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in principal and interest collections is primarily due to an increase in the amount of contracts managed 
contract sales and securitizations our business depends on our ability to aggregate and sell contracts in the form of asset backed securities 
these sales generate cash proceeds that allow us to repay amounts borrowed and to purchase additional contracts 
since  we have sold or securitized over billion of automobile receivables in public offerings  making us the fourth largest issuer by dollar amount of such securities in the nation 
changes in our asset backed securities program could materially adversely affect our earnings or ability to purchase and resell contracts on a timely basis 
such changes could include a delay in the completion of a planned securitization  negative market perception of us  or failure of the contracts we intend to sell to conform to insurance company and rating agency requirements 
if we are unable to effectively securitize our contracts  we may have to reduce or even curtail our contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
borrowings from parent our parent company is a federally insured savings institution 
it has the ability to raise significant amounts of liquidity by attracting both short term and long term deposits from the general public  commercial enterprises and institutions by offering a variety of accounts and rates 
the bank may also raise funds by issuing commercial paper  obtaining advances from the federal home loan bank  also known as the fhlb  and selling securities under agreements to repurchase and utilizing other borrowings 
we are able to utilize these liquidity sources through agreements we have entered into with our parent 
these include notes  lines of credit and the wfs reinvestment contract 
the notes are long term  unsecured debt  while the lines of credit are designed to provide financing to us and our subsidiaries 
these financing arrangements provide us with another source of liquidity beyond the secondary markets  thereby providing a source of short term funding and affording us a greater ability to choose the timing of our

the availability of these financing sources depends upon factors outside of our control  including regulatory issues such as the capital requirements of the bank and availability of funds at the bank 
if the bank were unable to extend this financing to us  we would need to replace it with outside sources or curtail contract purchasing activities  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations  by increasing our interest expense  reducing our interest income and negatively impacting our ability to remain a preferred source of financing for the dealers from whom we purchase contracts 
conduit financing we enter into secured conduit financing transactions using an automobile receivable securitization structure for short term financing needs 
for the years ended december  and  we issued million and million of notes secured by contracts through conduit facilities established in january and december  respectively

payments for such contracts are sent to our dealers either via an electronic funds transfer or check 
we purchased billion of contracts in compared with billion in and billion in payments of principal and interest on securitizations under the terms of our reinvestment contract  we fund quarterly payments of interest and principal to security holders derived from the cash flows on the securitized contracts that we service 
payments of principal and interest to security holders totaled billion in compared with billion and billion in and  respectively

advances due to servicer as the servicer of contracts sold in securitizations  we periodically make advances to the securitization trusts to provide for temporary delays in the receipt of required payments from borrowers in accordance with servicing agreements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk fluctuations in interest rates and early prepayment of contracts are the primary market risks facing us 
the credit and pricing committee is responsible for setting credit and pricing policies and for monitoring credit quality 
our asset liability committee is responsible for the management of interest rate and prepayment risks 
asset liability management is the process of measuring and controlling interest rate risk through matching the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets with those of interest bearing liabilities 
the asset liability committee closely monitors interest rate and prepayment risks and recommends policies for managing such risks 
the primary measurement tool for evaluating this risk is the use of interest rate shock analysis 
this analysis simulates the effect of an instantaneous and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points on our assets and liabilities and measures the resulting increase or decrease to the net present value  also known as npv  of our assets and liabilities 
it should be noted that shock analysis is objective but not entirely realistic in that it assumes an instantaneous and isolated set of events 
the contracts originated and held by us are fixed rate and  accordingly  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
to protect against potential changes in interest rates affecting interest payments on future securitization transactions  we enter into various hedge agreements 
we enter into euro dollar future contracts and forward agreements in order to hedge our future interest payments on our notes payable on automobile secured financing 
the market value of these hedge agreements responds inversely to changes in interest rates 
because of this inverse relationship  we can effectively lock in a gross interest rate spread at the time of entering into the hedge transaction 
gains and losses on these agreements are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
any ineffective portion is recognized in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
upon completion of the securitization  the gains or losses are recognized in full as an adjustment to the gain or loss on the sale of the contracts if the securitization is treated as a sale or amortized on a level yield basis over the duration of the notes issued if the transaction is treated as a secured financing 
these hedge instruments are settled daily  and therefore  there are no related financial instruments recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
credit risk related to these hedge instruments is minimal 
as we issued certain variable rate notes payable in and  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge our variable interest rate exposure on future interest payments 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is included in notes payable on automobile secured financing  and any change in the fair value is reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
any ineffective portion is recorded in interest expense during that period if the hedge is greater than effective 
related interest income or expense is settled on a quarterly basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income 
we also enter into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
or that we choose not to designate as hedges 
these derivatives pertain to variable rate notes issued in conjunction with the securitization of our contracts 
any change in the market value of such derivatives is recorded to income each month 
any income or expense recognized on such derivatives is recognized as miscellaneous income or expense 
the asset liability committee monitors our hedging activities to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by our senior management based upon the monitoring activities of the asset liability committee 
as a result of our approach to interest rate risk management and our hedging strategies  we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will materially affect our results of operations or liquidity  although we can provide no assurance in this regard 
there were no material changes in market risks in the current year compared with the prior year
