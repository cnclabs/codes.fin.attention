item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  may  will  or could and similar expressions or the negatives of these words or phrases are intended to identify forward looking statements 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this document  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections 
since our inception in as a wholly owned subsidiary of sepracor inc  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to establishing our business and conducting research and development activities related to our proprietary product candidates  including anidulafungin and dalbavancin  as well as collaborative product candidates 
since  we have been operating as an independent company 
in august  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in an initial public offering  and in september the underwriters exercised an over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares 
we received total net proceeds from the initial public offering and the over allotment of approximately million 
on april   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to selected institutional investors at a purchase price of per share 
we received net proceeds from the private placement of approximately million 
on february  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of biosearch italia spa  a publicly listed company in italy 
we have issued shares of our common stock for each outstanding share of biosearch stock  or approximately million shares 
we also intend to issue options covering approximately  common shares  including options issued to replace or assume options currently held by biosearch employees and consultants 
as a result  former versicor stockholders now own approximately of our outstanding common stock and former biosearch shareholders own approximately 
since we began our operations in  we have not generated any revenues from product sales 
our lead antifungal product candidate  anidulafungin  is in phase iii clinical trials and our lead antibiotic product candidate  dalbavancin entered into phase iii clinical trials in december we also have several lead compounds in pre clinical studies 
our revenues in the near term are expected to consist primarily of collaborative research payments  license fees and milestone payments to be received from our collaborators 
certain of these payments are dependent on achievement of specified milestones 
if the development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we will generate revenues from sales of these products and from receipt of royalties on sales of these products 
our expenses have consisted primarily of costs incurred when in licensing existing product candidates  research and development of new product candidates and in connection with our collaboration agreements  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect licensing costs to increase as certain milestones are achieved  and our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
following our recently completed merger with biosearch  we also expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel  integrate our operations and continue to expand our research and development operations 
we expect to incur sales and marketing expenses in the future when we establish our sales and marketing organization 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses  which may increase for the foreseeable future  including at least through december  we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible to ascertain 
major research and development projects our ongoing clinical trials of anidulafungin and dalbavancin are our two most significant research and development projects  generating and  respectively  of our total research and development expenses excluding non cash stock compensation expense since our inception 
anidulafungin anidulafungin is our lead antifungal product candidate 
we in licensed anidulafungin from eli lilly pursuant to the may agreement described below 
as of december   the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin is in phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis  patient enrollment completed  phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of invasive candidiasis candidemia  and phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of aspergillosis 
in may  we obtained from eli lilly an exclusive worldwide license for the development and commercialization of anidulafungin 
we paid million for the license and an additional million for product inventory which we have received 
as a result  we recognized million of research and development costs in if specified milestones are achieved on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin in the united states and canada  we will be obligated to make additional payments of up to million to eli lilly 
we are also obligated to make additional payments of up to million to eli lilly if specified milestones on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin are achieved in europe  and additional payments of up to million if specified milestones on the intravenous formulation of anidulafungin are achieved in japan 
we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if sales of an intravenous formulation of anidulafungin exceed specified targets in the united states and canada  europe and japan 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will be obligated to make all or a significant portion of these payments to eli lilly 
in addition  we are obligated to make royalty payments in respect of sales of any product resulting from the compound 
we are not currently developing an oral formulation of anidulafungin and do not presently intend to do so in the future 
however  under the license agreement with eli lilly  we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if  and only if  specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in the united states  additional payments of up to million if specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in europe  and additional payments of up to million if specified milestones are achieved on an oral formulation of anidulafungin in japan 
in addition  we are obligated to make additional payments to eli lilly of up to million if  and only if  sales of an oral formulation of anidulafungin exceed specified targets worldwide 
because an oral formulation of anidulafungin is not currently feasible  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be obligated to make any of these payments to eli lilly 
we have also granted to eli lilly an option to license the exclusive worldwide rights to any oral formulation of anidulafungin  which is exercisable upon successful completion of phase ii clinical trials 
if eli lilly exercises this option  eli lilly would pay us an up front fee and royalties based on net product sales  and would reimburse us for any milestone payments paid plus the value  on a cost plus basis  of all prior development expenses attributed to the development and commercialization of the oral formulation of anidulafungin 
however  due to the speculative nature of the oral formulation of anidulafungin  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be entitled to receive fees or royalties and reimbursement of expenses from eli lilly 
research and development expense excluding non cash stock compensation expense allocated to our anidulafungin project  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for the year compare to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for the each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our anidulafungin project is to obtain marketing approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
to obtain the first of such approvals  we hope to file a new drug application  or nda  with the fda at the conclusion of our phase iii trials for treatment of esophageal candidiasis  which has completed patient enrollment  assuming that the clinical trial s results support a filing 
that trial began in the first quarter of and  assuming successful completion of the phase iii trials  we anticipate filing an nda for anidulafungin by the end of april material cash inflows relating to our anidulafungin project will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if anidulafungin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
to date  we have not received any revenues from product sales of anidulafungin 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our anidulafungin project will commence  if ever 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for anidulafungin would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity because our research and development projects are independent  a failure to obtain marketing approval for anidulafungin would not necessarily interrupt our development programs for dalbavancin or our pre clinical compounds  however  we might reduce our development staff unless one or more of our other product candidates is then entering in late stage clinical trials  in which case we might re assign anidulafungin researchers to those projects  we would be relieved of our contingent obligation to make further milestone payments and royalty payments to eli lilly  we would not earn any sales revenue from anidulafungin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
dalbavancin dalbavancin is our lead antibiotic product candidate 
we in licensed dalbavancin from biosearch pursuant to the february agreement described below 
as of december   dalbavancin is in phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections  and phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of catheter related blood stream infections 
in february  we entered into a license agreement and a collaborative agreement with biosearch 
under the license agreement  biosearch granted us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize dalbavancin in the united states and canada 
in exchange for the license and upon the receipt of favorable results in pre clinical studies  we paid an initial license fee of million and issued  shares of our common stock to biosearch 
in may and december  we paid biosearch additional milestone payments for the start of phase ii and phase iii clinical trials  respectively 
research and development expense excluding non cash stock compensation expense allocated to our dalbavancin project  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for the year compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  our development administration overhead costs are included in total research and development expense for each period  but are not allocated among our various projects 
the goal of our dalbavancin project is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies  and we will consider the project substantially complete if we obtain those approvals even though subsequent to that time we might incur additional expenses in conducting additional clinical trials and follow up studies 
before we can obtain such marketing approvals we will need to complete pivotal phase iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
in any case  we would not expect to file an nda for dalbavancin until the second half of  at the earliest 
we are unable to estimate the costs to completion for our dalbavancin project due to the risks surrounding the clinical trial process  including the risk that we may repeat  revise or expand the scope of our ongoing clinical trials or conduct additional clinical trials to secure marketing approvals and the additional risks listed under the caption risk factors risks related to our business if clinical trials for our product candidates are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines  which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
material cash inflows relating to our dalbavancin project will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if dalbavancin finds acceptance in the marketplace 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our anidulafungin project will commence  if ever 
a failure to obtain marketing approval for dalbavancin would likely have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity because our research and development projects are independent  a failure to obtain marketing approval for dalbavancin would not necessarily interrupt our development programs for anidulafungin or our pre clinical compounds  however  we might reduce our development staff unless one or more of our other product candidates is then entering in late stage clinical trials  in which case we might be able to re assign dalbavancin researchers to those projects  we would not earn any sales revenue from dalbavancin  which would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our other development efforts  and our reputation among investors might be harmed  which might make it more difficult for us to obtain equity capital on attractive terms or at all 
risks relating to our major research and development projects we face many risks that could prevent or delay the completion of our anidulafungin and dalbavancin projects  including those listed under the caption risk factors risks related to operating in our industry 
development administration research and development expense excluding non cash stock compensation expense comprising development administration overhead costs  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from our inception through december  we do not allocate our development administration costs among our various projects because our development administration group is managed as a separate cost center and its expenditures are not always project specific 
other research and development projects the remaining of our total research and development expenses excluding non cash stock compensation expense from our inception through december  were generated by various pre clinical studies and drug discovery programs  including our collaborations with pharmacia and novartis described below 
oxazolidinones collaboration with pharmacia 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with pharmacia corporation pursuant to which we are collaborating to discover  synthesize and develop second and third generation oxazolidinone product candidates 
in connection with the collaboration  pharmacia made an equity investment in us of million and paid us research support and license fee payments 
under the terms of the agreement and in consideration of our research obligations  we are entitled to receive funding from pharmacia to support certain of our full time researchers 
if specified milestones are achieved  pharmacia is obligated to pay us additional payments of up to million for each compound  a portion of which may be credited against future royalty payments to which we are entitled on the worldwide sales of any drug developed and commercialized from the collaboration 
in october  pharmacia increased its funding for this collaboration by  and in june  we received a milestone payment for the initiation of clinical development of one of the compounds 
in july  we agreed with pharmacia by amendment to extend the collaboration for an additional three years through march through december   pharmacia has made aggregate payments to us under this collaboration agreement excluding equity investments of million 
research and development expense excluding non cash stock compensation expense allocated to our collaboration with pharmacia  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from january  through december  the goal of our collaboration with pharmacia is to discover  synthesize and obtain marketing approval for second and third generation oxazolidinone product candidates 
we supply research  product leads and other specified intellectual property to the collaboration 
the collaboration also depends upon pharmacia to develop the product candidates  to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies and to manufacture and sell any products resulting from the collaboration 
material cash inflows in the form of royalties relating to this collaboration will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
one product candidate resulting from the collaboration has entered phase i clinical trials 
in order to obtain marketing approval  pharmacia will need to complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
pharmacia is under no obligation to continue the development of any product candidate resulting from this collaboration 
because of this  and the substantial risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our collaboration with pharmacia will commence  if ever 
deformylase inhibitors collaboration with novartis 
in march  we entered into a collaboration agreement with novartis pharma ag pursuant to which we are collaborating to discover and develop novel deformylase inhibitors 
in connection with the collaboration  novartis made an initial equity investment in us of million 
we have also received a number of milestone payments from novartis and are entitled to receive additional payments of up to million for our compounds or up to million for novartis compounds upon the achievement of specified milestones 
novartis may deduct a portion of these milestone payments from the royalties it will be obligated to pay us on the worldwide sales of any drug developed and commercialized from this collaboration 
as a result of progress achieved by the collaboration  in july we agreed with novartis by amendment to extend the collaboration by an additional year through march through december   novartis has made aggregate payments to us under this agreement excluding equity investments of million 
research and development expense excluding non cash stock compensation expense allocated to our collaboration with novartis  expressed as a percentage of total research and development expense for the period excluding non cash stock compensation expense  was for the year  compared to for the year and for the year  and in the aggregate from january  through december  the goal of our collaboration with novartis is to discover  synthesize and obtain marketing approval for deformylase inhibitor product candidates 
we are responsible for supplying research to the collaboration  according to a research plan developed by a joint research committee 
our research obligations currently extend through march novartis provides us with funding to support some of our researchers on this project 
the collaboration will depend upon novartis to conduct the development of product candidates and to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international agencies 
material cash inflows in the form of royalties relating to this collaboration will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
currently all compounds identified by the collaboration are still in pre clinical stages 
in order to obtain marketing approval  novartis will need to initiate and complete phase i  ii and iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a nda to the fda 
novartis is under no obligation to continue the development of any product candidate resulting from this collaboration 
because of this  and the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from our collaboration with novartis will commence  if ever 
in addition to the work on deformylase inhibitors  under the collaboration agreement we have been delivering to novartis a series of screening assays based on novel anti bacterial targets 
for each screen that novartis accepts as validated  we receive a milestone payment 
in august and january  novartis paid us our fourth and fifth milestone payment  respectively  as a result of our delivery of our fourth and fifth target based screens  which we expect will be used in novartis high throughput screening laboratory to identify new anti infectives 
a failure by pharmacia or novartis to pursue or obtain marketing approval for any product candidate resulting from our collaborations could have the following results on our operations  financial position and liquidity we would not receive any further milestone payments or any royalty revenue from the collaborations  and while we do not rely on any particular external development collaboration to produce marketable products and  ultimately  royalty revenues  the failure of all of our external development collaborations would increase the likelihood that we would need to obtain additional financing for our internal research and development efforts 
deferred stock compensation we have recorded deferred stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
we recorded deferred stock compensation net of cancellations of   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
revenues consisted of million  million and million of collaborative research and development  contract services and licensing fees from pharmacia in  and  respectively  and million  million and million of collaborative research and development fees and milestone payments from novartis in  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in revenues in is due to a decrease in revenue from the pharmacia upfront license and contract research fees that were recognized as revenue over the initial three year contract term through march  the increase in revenues in was due to the increase in collaborative research and development funding from both pharmacia and novartis 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  as well as the costs of consultants  parts and supplies and clinical trials associated with research and development projects 
during  and  we recorded  million and million of amortization of non cash stock compensation  respectively 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenditure in both and is primarily due to the increase in clinical expenditure for the development of our product candidates 
our lead product candidate  anidulafungin  moved into phase iii clinical trials in the first half of and our second product candidate  dalbavancin  moved into phase ii clinical trials in the second quarter of and phase iii clinical trials in december we have also increased the size of our development administration team from one person in february to at december  in addition  we have expanded our collaborative and internal research programs 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for executive and other administrative personnel  as well as the costs of facilities  insurance  legal fees and administrative service fees paid to sepracor prior to our initial public offering in august general and administrative costs included amortization of non cash stock compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding the amortization of non cash stock compensation charges  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in mainly due to a reduction in business development activity from the increase in general and administrative expenses in over is due to the increase in personnel  legal  insurance and other expenses associated with being a public company  the expansion of our research and development operations and business development activities 
net interest income expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net interest income expense consists of interest income on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest expense on our term loans and equipment notes 
the decrease in net interest income in and is due to the significant reduction in interest rates during these two years 
income taxes 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we also have federal research credit carryforwards of million 
the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change in ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations principally with the proceeds of million from a series of six preferred stock offerings over the period through  and net proceeds of million from our initial public offering received in august and september in addition  on april   we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock to selected institutional investors at a purchase price of per share  from which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we have also received approximately million in payments for collaborative research  contract services and milestone payments  as well as license fees from our collaborators  including sepracor 
of these payments  million constitutes deferred revenue as of december  we have also increased our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as a result of our recently completed merger with biosearch 
at december   biosearch had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
in addition  we have a million term loan and million equipment note with a commercial bank 
the term loan accrues interest at the prime rate plus the prime rate was at december  and the equipment note s interest rate is based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin the applicable libor rate for our note was at december  
as of december   there was an outstanding loan balance of million and an outstanding note balance of million 
proceeds from the loan were used to repay sepracor for leasehold improvements to our facilities and for general corporate purposes 
proceeds from drawdowns on the equipment note were used to finance capital expenditure 
the terms of the term loan were renegotiated in january and the balance of million is now repayable in eight equal quarterly installments beginning on march  with the final payment due on december  the final note balance is also payable on december  also  in january the term loan was amended to include a three year equipment note for million that we are able to draw down on through december  the note bears interest at the prime rate unless we exercise an option to have the interest on all or any portion of the principal amount based on the libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the interest on the note is payable in quarterly installments during the draw down period 
the principal of the note is payable in equal installments beginning on march  with the final payment due on december  years ended december   and cash used in operations was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the net loss of million for was offset by non cash charges for the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million less an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the net loss of million for was partially offset by non cash charges for the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
in both and  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is a direct result of the increase in our operating costs principally relating to the increase in clinical trial expenditure for the development of our product candidates 
in  the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily relates to prepaid acquisition costs relating to the merger of biosearch with and into versicor 
in  the net loss of million was partially offset by non cash charges for the amortization of non cash stock compensation and depreciation of million and also the release of million of restricted cash that was no longer required to be maintained under our term loan agreement with fleet national bank 
the decrease in non cash stock compensation in and is due to the fact that the majority of the compensation relates to options issued prior to our initial public offering in august and is being amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
investing activities used million  million and million of cash during  and  respectively 
in  the net change in marketable securities was million as proceeds from our private placement in april funded the majority of our operating loss for the year 
in  cash was primarily used for the net purchases of marketable securities of million due to a change in investment portfolio managers and in  cash was primarily used for the net purchases of marketable securities with the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
capital expenditure was  million and  in  and  respectively 
higher capital expenditure in related to leasehold improvements at our california facility 
financing activities provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
in  our principal source of cash resulted from net proceeds of million received from the private placement of  shares of common stock to certain institutional investors in april repayments on our term loans increased in due to the equipment note that we entered into in the second half of in  the draw down on our equipment loan of million was partially offset by repayments of our term loan of  in  we received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering in august future payments under debt and lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands term loan and equipment notes operating leases total thereafter   we expect to have negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur increasing research and development  and general and administrative expenses  including expenses relating to clinical development  additions to personnel  production and commercialization efforts and the integration of our operations with those of biosearch 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing markets for our products  payments received or made under collaboration agreements  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new products or compounds  the status of competitive products and the availability of other financing 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents  trading securities and available for sale securities acquired in the merger  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt repayments and capital requirements for at least months 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this standard will require gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of unusual and infrequent in opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
any gain or loss on extinguishment will be recorded in the most appropriate line item to which it relates within net income before extraordinary items 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   however  certain sections are effective for transactions occurring after may  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard will require us to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the standard replaces the existing guidance provided by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on its financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenues as they are earned 
revenue from license fees and contract services are recognized over the initial license or contract service term as the related work is performed  which generally is on a straight line basis 
nonrefundable milestone payments received are recognized when they are earned  which is when the specific events which coincide with the achievement of substantive elements in the related collaboration agreements are achieved 
milestone payments received that are creditable against future royalty payments are deferred and recognized as revenue when the royalties are earned or when the payment is no longer creditable against future payments 
collaborative research and development payments are recognized as the related work is performed 
valuation allowance we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our term loan and equipment notes with a commercial bank 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
however  due to the conservative and short term nature of these investments  such exposure is limited 
borrowings under our term loan and equipment loan are also exposed to interest rate risk as they are subject to interest rates based on the bank s base rate or libor 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents  average interest rate marketable securities  average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities approximate the principal amounts reflected above based on the short term maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our debt obligations approximates the principal amounts due based on the interest rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the years presented 
currency risk as a result of our recently completed merger with biosearch  we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions insofar as we might desire to use us dollars to make contract payments denominated in euros or vice versa 
as the net positions of our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuates  our earnings might be negatively affected 
in addition  we are exposed to risks associated with the translation of euro denominated financial results and accounts into us dollars 
although our reporting currency remains the us dollar  a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and costs now arise in euros  which we restate in us dollars for purposes of financial reporting  based on exchange rates prevailing at the end of the applicable reporting period 
in addition  the reported carrying value of our euro denominated assets and liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period
