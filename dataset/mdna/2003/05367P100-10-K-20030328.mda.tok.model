item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  market  sell and support a wide range of software and hardware for digital media production  management and distribution 
digital media are video  audio or graphic elements in which the image  sound or picture is recorded and stored as digital values  as opposed to analog  or tape based  signals 
during  we announced and implemented restructuring plans to decrease costs through the consolidation of operations 
the restructuring actions were taken to improve our cost structure and profitability given the economic pressures facing the company  and were generally not targeted at specific products or services 
as a result  we recorded total charges of million during the year related to the termination of employees  or of our work force  and the vacating of certain facilities 
in january  we acquired the remaining ownership interest in inews  which was formerly held by the grass valley group a unit of thomson multimedia 
since the acquisition date  operating results of inews have been included in our consolidated operating results 
for  our share of the operating results of inews was included in other income expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management continuously re evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for product returns and exchanges  allowance for bad debts  the valuation of inventories and income tax assets  and reserves for recourse under financing transactions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of the company s financial condition and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenue from sales of software or products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and all other revenue recognition criteria of sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
our products do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires insignificant effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  certain transactions  those typically involving orders from end users of a significant number of products for a single customer site  may require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be non routine and complex 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenue from either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if such orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenue is recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
approximately of our revenue is derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
most of our resellers and distributors are not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  some channel partners  particularly those who resell our audio products  have agreements with us that grant them limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers  and considers the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions  and other known factors 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management s estimates of potential product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from actual experience 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element s is deferred and the remaining portion of the revenue is recognized 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
at the time of a sale transaction  avid must make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is only recognized at that time if management is reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  management considers customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
at that same time  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable  considering the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transaction without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days but up to days after the invoice date  we evaluate whether the fee is fixed or determinable 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions avid maintains allowances for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
avid  through a third party  provides lease financing options to many of its customers 
during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
see footnote i to our consolidated financial statements in item we record revenue from these transactions upon the shipment of our products since we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participated in the program could require additional reserves 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months  and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   we believe it is more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one period or over many periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring and other costs  net amortization of acquisition related intangible assets total operating expenses operating income loss other income and expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss net revenues our net revenues are derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  non linear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of related software  and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
this market has been  and we expect it to continue to be  highly competitive 
a significant portion of these revenues is generated by sales near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to accurately forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
increasingly  revenues are also being derived from sales of solutions encompassing multiple products and networking capabilities that enable users to share and manage media throughout a project or organization 
such solution sales may include training and installation services  as well as workflow management assistance  to be provided by us or a third party 
depending upon the complexity of the arrangement and the level of our involvement  the revenues resulting from these solution sales may be deferred for one or more quarters while the services are being performed 
net revenues decreased from million in to million in revenues in our video and film editing and effects video business declined million or  while revenues in our professional audio audio business grew by million or 
we believe that a portion of the video business decline was due to the general worldwide economic slowdown 
more specifically  we believe that a reduction in advertising spending worldwide had a negative impact on our post production video business  causing our customers to reduce capital spending pending an upturn in their businesses 
revenue in our video segment was also adversely impacted by pricing reductions and discounts  driven in part by the introduction of new lower end products into the market by us and our competitors 
our audio business contributed favorably to revenues during due to strong demand for our new flagship digital audio workstation  pro tools hd  which was introduced in january we generally see an increase in revenues when we introduce a significant new product or product enhancement 
net revenues decreased from million in to million in this decrease occurred across product families in both our video business and our audio business 
we believe that a portion of this overall decline was due to the general worldwide economic slowdown 
certain product families within the video business segment  in particular broadcast products and services  avid unity  and avid ds hd introduced in early  showed growth year over year  but this growth was more than offset by declines in other product families  including our media composer family 
the increase in broadcast product and service revenue was attributable primarily to the acquisitions of inews in january and pluto in september the decline in the audio business segment was primarily attributable to weaker third and fourth quarter revenues as customers anticipated the release in early january of the new hd products 
during  we began shipping new releases of most of our products 
these releases included pro tools hd  avid unity lanshare ex v  avid xpress dv v  avid ds hd v  newscutter xp v  newscutter xp mobile v avid symphony v  avid media composer v  avid xpress v and softimage xsi v and v during  we began shipments of avid ds hd  newscutter xp v  newscutter xp mobile  avid unity medianetwork v  avid unity lanshare and softimage xsi v  as well as several point releases of other existing products 
we also began offering inews products and services as a result of the acquisition in january net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for  compared to of net revenues for and of net revenues for the increase in direct selling from to was due primarily to the growth in sales to our broadcast customers that generally require a longer selling cycle with more direct support 
we expect sales to broadcast customers will be an area of potential revenue growth in the future 
international sales sales to customers outside the united states and canada accounted for of our net revenues  compared to for and for international sales decreased by approximately million or in compared to  and by million or in compared to half of the decrease in international sales in compared to occurred in europe  with the remainder occurring in the asia pacific region and latin america 
management believes these declines were attributable to the economic climate and  in asia  the impact of currency translation 
the decrease in international sales in compared to reflected decreases in europe primarily and  to a lesser extent  in asia pacific and latin america 
management believes these declines were attributable to the poor economic climate and the impact of currency translation 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing  and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs  royalties for third party software included in the products  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
the resulting gross profit fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our gross margin decreased to in compared to in  which had increased from in the decrease during primarily reflects the impact of price reductions  discounts and promotions and higher manufacturing costs  primarily in the audio segment  partially offset by a favorable product mix in other words  a greater proportion of higher margin products were sold in as compared to  a positive margin impact from the audio segment delivering third party promotional software for which revenue had previously been deferred  and a positive impact from currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the increase during reflects lower vendor material costs  manufacturing efficiencies  and in the video business  a favorable product mix 
these increases in were partially offset by a shift to lower margin audio products and the negative impact of currency fluctuations  primarily a weakening of the japanese yen  and to a lesser extent the euro  resulting in lower us dollar equivalent revenue 
research and development research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to  and increased by million  or  in compared to the decrease in expenditures in was primarily due to lower personnel related costs in the video business as a result of restructuring actions taken during  as well as lower depreciation expense  partially offset by higher hardware development costs and the absence of third party funding of certain research and development projects which occurred in the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to increased personnel related expenses and facility costs  primarily associated with the acquisitions of inews in january and pluto in september and the relocation of digidesign s facilities in late  partially offset by a reduction in variable employee compensation expense 
research and development expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues  to in from in  primarily due to the decreased expenses noted above 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues  to in from in  primarily due to the increased expenses noted above and the decreased revenue base in marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to  and by million  or  in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to lower marketing expenditures such as trade shows  advertising and direct mailings  as well as lower personnel related expenses resulting from various restructuring actions that occurred in we are  however  continuing to invest in sales resources as we see opportunities for revenue growth 
the decrease in expenditures in compared to was primarily due to reductions in bad debt expense  variable employee compensation and trade show expenditures 
these decreases were partially offset by twelve months of incremental inews costs 
marketing and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the decreased expenses noted above 
marketing and selling expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to a decreased revenue base in general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or in compared to  and by million  or  in compared to the decrease in occurred primarily as a result of reduced external legal fees  lower personnel related expenses and depreciation  partially offset by expense related to executive severance benefits incurred in the decrease in expenses in compared to was primarily the result of reduced personnel related costs  including variable compensation expense  recruiting and relocation costs and executive severance benefits 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the reductions in expenses discussed above 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenues to in from in  primarily due to the reductions in personnel related costs discussed above 
restructuring and other costs in december  we recorded a charge of approximately million in connection with vacating excess space in our daly city  california  tewksbury  massachusetts  and montreal  canada facilities 
the tewksbury charge of million was a revision of our estimate related to the august restructuring action discussed below  based on our attempts to sublet the related space during the remaining portion of the charge for daly city and montreal was the result of our ceasing to use a portion of each facility in december and hiring real estate brokers to assist in finding subtenants 
the daly city charge of million reflects a depressed real estate market in the area 
in march  we implemented a restructuring plan related to our softimage operations 
as a result  employees were terminated  primarily in montreal  canada  and we vacated a leased facility in california 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a million restructuring charge during the first quarter of the restructuring charge included approximately million for severance and related costs of terminated employees and million for facility vacancy costs  including a non cancelable lease commitment 
in june  we implemented a restructuring plan related to the avid internet solutions operations resulting in the termination of seven employees and a restructuring charge of million for severance and related costs 
in august  we implemented a restructuring plan to further decrease costs through the consolidation of operations and the reduction of approximately jobs worldwide 
in connection with this plan  we recorded a charge to operating expenses of million in the third quarter 
the restructuring charge included approximately million for severance and related costs of terminated employees and million for facility vacancy costs  of which million represented non cash charges relating to the disposition of leasehold improvements that were abandoned upon vacating the related properties in these restructuring actions were expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  and management believes that these savings have been achieved 
in connection with these and prior plans  we made cash payments in of million related to personnel severance related costs and million related to vacated facilities 
in  we made severance related payments of million  facilities related payments of million and wrote off million of leasehold improvements 
the remaining accrual balance at december  was million  of which million relates to personnel costs and million relates to facility costs 
in december  in connection with the resignation of two executive officers  we incurred and recorded a charge of million for termination benefits as specified in the employment contracts of the officers 
through december   cash payments of approximately million had been made in full satisfaction of our obligations 
as a result  in  we recorded a credit of million to restructuring and other costs  net  associated with a reduction in the estimated liability 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to sell its italian subsidiary to a third party which established the entity as a distributor of avid products 
the sale was completed in the first quarter of in  we recorded a loss of approximately million related to the sale  including a reserve of million for our guarantee of the new entity s line of credit with a bank 
this guarantee ended on january  without requiring any cash payment by us 
accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a credit associated with the reversal of the reserve  which was included under the caption restructuring and other cost  net  where the charge was originally recorded 
in addition  during each of the quarters ended june  and  we received payments of million in full satisfaction of a note received as partial consideration from the buyers of the italian subsidiary 
these payments were recorded as credits to restructuring and other costs  net since the note was fully reserved when initially recorded 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in connection with our august acquisition of softimage  we allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill and million to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies  work force  and trade name 
during  a balance sheet purchase accounting adjustment was recorded which decreased goodwill by approximately million 
included in the operating results for and is amortization of these intangible assets and goodwill of million and million  respectively 
as of december   these intangible assets  including goodwill  were fully amortized 
during  and  we recorded additional intangible assets as we acquired the following companies iknowledge  inc in  inews  llc in  and the motion factory  inc and pluto technologies international inc 
in in connection with these acquisitions  we allocated million to intangible assets consisting of completed technologies and work force 
included in the operating results for  and is amortization of these intangible assets of million  million and million  respectively 
as of january   in connection with the adoption of sfas  we reclassified million of a previously recorded assembled work force intangible to goodwill and  as a result  ceased amortizing this amount 
during  we recorded no goodwill or assembled work force amortization as compared to approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  for these acquisitions 
the unamortized balance of the intangible assets relating to these acquisitions  including goodwill  was million at december  other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  generally consists of interest income  interest expense and equity in income of non consolidated companies 
during  other income and expense  net  decreased million  from million in this decrease was primarily due to two items in the amount not recurring in a net gain of million recorded in upon the sale of all common stock received in connection with the sale in of our investment in avid sports llc  and our equity in the net income of inews related to their fourth quarter operations that was recorded in of million we acquired inews in january 
additionally  interest income decreased in compared to due to a decline in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  lower average cash and investment balances on hand 
we also recorded a further impairment charge of million during for an investment in an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the cost method  after this charge  our investment has been fully written off 
offsetting these decreases in interest and other income  net  was reduced interest expense in compared to  as a result of our prepayment in february of a note payable to microsoft 
during  other income and expense  net  increased million  from million in the increase was primarily due to the net gain of million recorded upon the sale of all common stock associated with the sale of our investment in avid sports llc discussed above 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest income  primarily attributable to a decline in interest rates  the elimination of our equity in the net income of inews as a result of the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in  and an impairment charge of million on an unconsolidated entity accounted for under the cost method 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  respectively  for   and the tax rate in each year includes net changes in the valuation allowance for us related deferred tax assets and an addition to the valuation allowance against a majority of the foreign deferred tax assets 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us and foreign taxable income  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the establishment of a full valuation allowance 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes  the us federal research tax credit and our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been for this differs from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state taxes  the us federal research tax credit and our foreign subsidiaries  which are taxed at different rates

liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations to date through both private and public sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities totaling approximately million 
with respect to cash flow  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in and million in during  cash generated from operating activities primarily reflects net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization  as well as cash generated through a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue 
this was partially offset by an increase in inventories 
during  cash generated from operating activities reflected net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization  as well as a decrease in accounts receivable 
this was partially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
during  cash generated from operating activities reflected net income after adjustment for depreciation and amortization and provision for doubtful accounts  offset by cash uses attributable primarily to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in we purchased million of property and equipment during  compared to million in and million in we also acquired million of property and equipment under capital leases during purchases in were primarily of computer hardware and software to support research and development activities and our information systems 
purchases in were primarily of computers and furniture and fixtures purchased in connection with the relocation of the digidesign facility to daly city  california and hardware and software to support research and development activities and our information systems 
purchases in were primarily of equipment to support research and development activities 
our capital spending program for is currently expected to be approximately million  primarily for hardware and software to support activities in the research and development  information systems  and manufacturing areas 
however  this amount could increase in the event we enter into strategic business acquisitions or for other reasons 
during  we made a cash payment of approximately million to acquire selected assets of iknowledge  inc as part of the purchase agreement  we may be required to make certain contingent cash payments  dependent upon the future revenues of the products acquired from iknowledge  through december as of december   contingent payments owed were immaterial 
during  we also made a cash payment  net of cash acquired  of million for the purchase of the remaining ownership interest in inews 
also during  we received million in cash upon the sale of all common stock received in connection with the sale in of our investment in avid sports llc

during  and  we generated cash of approximately million  million and million  respectively  net of common stock repurchases  from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
also in  we made a prepayment in full satisfaction of a million note to microsoft 
during  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
purchases were made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   the repurchase program was complete 
repurchased shares have been used for our employee stock plans 
as a result of our restructuring efforts during and prior periods  we have commitments to pay severance and other termination benefits to employees of approximately million over the next twelve months 
in connection with these restructuring efforts  as well as with the identification in of excess space in various locations  we also have facility related cash obligations of approximately million as a result of losses to be incurred or expected to be incurred on subleases of space or lease vacancies 
these payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate an earlier termination 
all restructuring related payments will be funded through working capital 
we believe existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
in the event we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms 
contractual and commercial obligations the following table sets forth future payments that we are obligated to make  as of december   under existing debt agreements  leases and other arrangements in thousands less than after total year years years years capital lease obligations  operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   other contractual arrangements that may result in cash payments consist of the following in thousands total less than year years transactions with recourse   stand by letter of credit   through a third party  we have entered into lease financing transactions with our customers 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user 
our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
as of december   our maximum exposure under this program was million 
we have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of default on our lease the landlord would  as of december   be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum of million  subject to an annual reduction of approximately million but not below million 
the letter of credit will remain at million throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september as of december   we were not in default of this lease 
we conduct our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange exposures of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   we are in a sell position with respect to the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar and australian dollar and in a buy position with respect to the british pound and singapore dollar 
our currency position at december  is summarized as follows in thousands approximate us dollar equivalent euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  british pound  australian dollar new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which nullifies eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had allowed the liability to be recorded at the commitment date of an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted the provisions of sfas  as permitted  in connection with charges taken for losses on vacated space recorded in december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on the amount of the charge or  as such  on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends safs no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  as we did not make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee awards in  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure  recognition and measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december   the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with characteristics of a controlling financial interest or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
additionally  companies with significant investments in variable interest entities  even if not required to consolidate the variable interest entity  have enhanced disclosure requirements 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf requires that for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  those deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria as defined by eitf arrangement consideration is to be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values and revenue recognition decisions should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the scope of eitf but believes that the company s multiple element arrangements fall within the scope of sop and therefore  eitf will not be applicable to the company 
certain factors that may affect future results some of the statements in this form k relating to our future performance constitute forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations and involve known and unknown risks 
realization of any of these risks may cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements 
certain of these risks are as follows our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products in the digital editing market 
our products  particularly the media composer family of products  have captured significant market share in our core digital video and film editing market 
as such  future growth in this market could be limited and will depend in part upon our ability to introduce new features and functionality for media composer products  improve upon their price performance  respond to competitive offerings  introduce and transition to new products  and adapt to new industry requirements and standards 
any delay or failure to develop these enhancements or to introduce other new products in this market could harm our business and reduce our operating results 
at the same time  the introduction and transition to new products could have an impact on the market for our existing products  which could adversely affect our revenues and business 
the broadcast market is large  widely dispersed  and highly competitive  and we may not be successful in growing our customer base or predicting customer demand in this market 
we are currently building our presence in the broadcast market and have augmented our newscutter product offering with the avid unity for news products  and the server  newsroom  and browser products obtained in the pluto and inews acquisitions 
the broadcast market is distinguished from our traditional video business in that turn key  fully integrated  complex solutions including the configuration of unique workflows  rather than discrete point products  are frequently required by the customer 
as a relatively new player in the broadcast market  we may encounter difficulties in establishing ourselves  creating compelling customer solutions  and developing a strong  loyal customer base 
large  complex broadcast orders often require us to devote significant sales  manufacturing  installation  and support resources to ensure their successful and timely fulfillment 
as the broadcast market converts from analog to digital  our strategy has been to build our broadcast solutions team in response to customer demand 
to the extent that customer demand for our broadcast solutions exceeds our expectations  we may encounter difficulties in the short run meeting our customers needs 
meanwhile  our competitors may devote greater resources to the broadcast market than we do  or may be able to leverage their market presence more effectively 
if we are unsuccessful in capturing and maintaining a share of this digital broadcast market or in predicting and satisfying customer demand  our business and revenues could be adversely affected 
we have a significant share of the professional audio market  and therefore growth in this market will depend in part on our ability to successfully introduce new products 
currently  products of our digidesign division have captured a significant portion of the professional audio market 
digidesign s strong performance in recent years reflects a series of successful product introductions 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to offer  on a timely and cost effective basis  new audio products and enhancements of our existing audio products 
the timely development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process  and we could experience design  manufacturing  marketing  or other difficulties that delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products or enhancements  which  in turn  could harm our business 
we are expanding our product line and offering solutions to new markets  and our future revenues depend in part on the success of this expansion 
traditionally  we have been a point product company 
increasingly  we are providing end to end solutions for our customers 
we are expanding our product line beyond our core video editing market to offer digital media production solutions to the broadcast news market including cable and internet news  the on line film and video finishing market  and the emerging market for multimedia production tools including the internet and corporate markets 
because these markets are evolving  we must anticipate our customers future needs and introduce compelling new products  gain market acceptance  and establish appropriate distribution channels  support  and maintenance 
to the extent that we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs  we may need to adjust our plans accordingly  which could cause delays  unexpected expenses  and reallocation of our resources  and which in turn could harm our business and reduce our operating results 
the markets for our products are competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the digital video  audio  and animation markets are competitive  with limited barriers to entry  and are characterized by pressure to reduce prices  incorporate new features  and accelerate the release of new products 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  support  or marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may use these resources to lower their product costs  allowing them to reduce prices to levels at which we could not operate profitably 
further  such competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to ours  or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
if we are unable to compete effectively in our target markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
competition in the d market has increased dramatically since our acquisition of softimage 
the d market has changed significantly from the time we acquired our softimage subsidiary in august while softimage once dominated the higher end of the d market ie  feature films and other intensive graphics applications  competitors products have eroded softimage s market share and have contributed to downward price pressure  which has resulted in reduced margins 
in addition  we have experienced delays in introducing new products into the d animation market 
finally  revenues in recent years have been increasingly derived from sales to the games industry and non traditional markets 
if these non traditional markets were to slow or delay their purchases of d tools  our revenues could be adversely affected 
to the extent that these factors continue or worsen  our business could suffer 
we use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities 
independent firms and contractors  some of whom are located in other countries  perform some of our product development activities 
we generally own the software developed by these contractors 
the use of independent firms and contractors  especially those located abroad  could expose us to risks related to governmental regulation  intellectual property ownership and rights  exchange rate fluctuation  political instability and unrest  natural disasters  and other risks  which could adversely impact our revenues 
we depend on a number of sole source suppliers 
we are dependent on a number of specific suppliers for certain key components of our products 
we purchase these sole source components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
we generally do not carry significant inventories of these sole source components and have no guaranteed supply arrangements 
if any of our sole source vendors failed to supply or enhance such components  it could imperil our supply of these components 
similarly  if any of our vendors encountered technical  operating or financial difficulties  it could threaten our supply of these components 
while we believe that alternative sources for these components could be developed  or our products could be redesigned to permit the use of alternative components  an interruption of our supply could damage our business and negatively affect our operating results 
our products are complex and delays or difficulties in introducing new products could harm our business 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to offer products that compete favorably with our competitors products in terms of reliability  performance  ease of use  range of features  product enhancements  reputation  price  and training 
delays or difficulties in product development and introduction may harm our business 
our products are internally complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
such errors or defects could cause us to issue corrective releases and could result in loss of revenues  increased product returns  lack of market acceptance  and damage to our reputation 
new product announcements by our competitors and by us could have the effect of reducing customer demand for our existing products 
some of our new products constitute upgrades of existing products 
in the past  we have offered discounts on the price of such upgrades to existing customers  which  where appropriate  have been based upon the return of circuit boards and system keys 
to the extent that such circuit boards and system keys are not returned  it can decrease the revenue generated by such new products 
new product introductions require us to devote time and resources to training our sales channels in product features and target customers  with the temporary result that the sales channels have less time to devote to selling our products 
qualifying and supporting our products on multiple computer platforms is time consuming and expensive 
our software engineers devote significant time and effort to qualify and support our products on various computer platforms  including most notably  microsoft s windows and apple s macintosh platforms 
computer platform modifications and upgrades require additional time to be spent to ensure that our products will function properly 
to the extent that the current configuration of the qualified and supported platforms change or that we need to qualify and support new platforms  we could be required to expend valuable engineering resources  which is likely to adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results are dependent on several unpredictable factors 
the revenue and gross profit from our products depend on many factors  including o mix of products sold  o cost and proportion of third party hardware included in such products  o product distribution channels  o timing of new product introductions  o product offers and platform upgrades  o price discounts and sales promotion programs  o volume of sales of aftermarket hardware products  o costs of swapping or fixing products released to the market with defects  o provisions for inventory obsolescence  o competitive pressure on product prices  o costs incurred in connection with solution sales  which typically have longer selling and implementation cycles  o timing and delivery of solutions to customers  and o currency fluctuations 
negative changes in any of these factors could reduce our revenue and gross profit 
our operating costs are tied to projections of future revenues  which may differ from actual results 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenues 
such future revenues are difficult to predict 
for example  the current worldwide economic slowdown has had an impact on our recent results  and if this slowdown persists  it may continue to lower our revenues 
additionally  a significant portion of our business occurs near the end of each quarter  which can impact our ability to precisely forecast revenues on a quarterly basis 
further  we are generally unable to reduce quarterly operating expense levels rapidly in the event that quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations 
therefore  if quarterly revenue levels fail to meet internal expectations upon which expense levels are based  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
poor global macroeconomic conditions could disproportionately impact our industry 
as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  our customers in the media  broadcast and content creation industries have delayed or reduced expenditures 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends primarily on the overall demand for our products 
softening demand for our products resulting from ongoing economic uncertainty may result in decreased revenues or earnings levels or growth rates 
if global economic conditions worsen  demand for our products may weaken  and our business and results of operations could suffer 
terrorism  acts of war  and other international conflicts may seriously harm our business 
terrorism or acts of war throughout the world may disrupt our business and harm our employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue and operating results 
the potential for future terrorist attacks and other threats to national security  and the responses of the united states and other countries to such attacks or threats  including the present action against iraq  have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and stock price in ways that cannot be predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism  acts of war  or other international conflicts 
if we fail to maintain strong relationships with our resellers  distributors  and suppliers  our ability to successfully deploy our products may be harmed 
we sell many of our products and services indirectly through resellers and distributors 
the resellers and distributors of our video segments products typically purchase software and kits from us  and other turn key components from other vendors  in order to produce complete systems for resale 
any disruption to our resellers and distributors  or their third party suppliers  could reduce our revenues 
moreover  we are increasingly distributing our products directly  which could put us in competition with our resellers and distributors and could adversely affect our revenues 
most of the resellers and distributors of our video products are not granted rights to return products after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  our revenue from sales of audio products is generally derived from transactions with distributors and authorized resellers that typically allow limited rights of return  inventory stock rotation and price protection 
accordingly  reserves for estimated returns  exchanges and credits for price protection are provided  as a reduction of revenues  upon shipment of the related products to such distributors and resellers  based upon our historical experience 
to date  actual returns have not differed materially from management s estimates 
however  if returns of our audio segment products were to exceed estimated levels  our revenues and operating results could be adversely impacted 
if we become dependent on third party hardware for our products  our operating results could be harmed 
our gross profit margin varies from product to product depending primarily on the proportion and cost of third party hardware included in each product 
from time to time  we add functionality and features to our products 
if we effect such additions through the use of more  or more costly  third party hardware  and are not able to increase the price of such products to offset these increased costs  then our gross profit margin on these products could decrease 
our future growth could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our success depends upon the services of a number of key current employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could harm our business 
our success also depends upon our ability to attract highly skilled new employees 
competition for such employees is intense in the industries and geographic areas in which we operate 
if we are unable to compete successfully for such employees  our business could suffer 
our websites could subject us to legal claims that could harm our business 
some of our websites provide interactive information and services to our customers 
to the extent that materials may be posted on and or downloaded from these websites and distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  or other theories of liability based on the nature  content  publication or distribution of such materials 
in addition  although we have attempted to limit our exposure by contract  we may also be subject to claims for indemnification by end users in the event that the security of our websites is compromised 
as these websites are available on a worldwide basis  they could potentially be subject to a wide variety of international laws 
regulations could be enacted that restrict our internet initiatives 
as a result of the increasing use and popularity of the internet  federal  state  and local authorities may adopt new laws and regulations governing the internet 
these laws and regulations may cover issues such as privacy  distribution  and content 
the enactment of any additional laws or regulations could impede the growth of the internet  harm our internet initiatives  and place additional financial burdens on our business 
we could incur substantial costs protecting our intellectual property or defending against a claim of infringement 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we rely upon a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secret  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions  as well as hardware security keys  to protect our proprietary technology 
however  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
from time to time unauthorized persons have obtained  copied  and used information that we consider proprietary 
policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
we occasionally receive communications suggesting that our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
it is our practice to investigate the factual basis of such communications and negotiate licenses where appropriate 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more products or relating to current or future technologies  we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology or unable to negotiate licenses for the use of others intellectual property  our business could be impaired 
we are currently involved in various legal proceedings  including patent litigation 
an adverse resolution of any such proceedings could harm our business and reduce our results of operations 
see note i  commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements 
if we acquire other companies or businesses  we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business 
we periodically acquire businesses  form strategic alliances  or make debt or equity investments 
the risks associated with such acquisitions  alliances  and investments include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the target companies  the failure to realize anticipated return on investment  cost savings and synergies  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
such acquisitions  alliances  and investments often involve significant transaction related costs and could cause short term disruption to normal operations 
if we are unable to overcome or counter these risks  it could undermine our business and lower our operating results 
our operating results could be harmed by currency fluctuations 
a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in the value of major foreign currencies including the euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen relative to the value of the us dollar could lower future revenues and operating results 
a portion of our sales are financed under a third party leasing program 
we have an established leasing program with a third party that allows certain of our customers who choose to do so to finance their purchases 
if this program ended abruptly or unexpectedly  some of our customers might be unable to purchase our products unless or until they were able to arrange for alternative financing  and this could adversely impact our revenues 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the recent past and could fluctuate substantially in the future based upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include o changes in our quarterly operating results  o shortfalls in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  o changes in analysts recommendations or projections  o fluctuations in investors perceptions of us or our competitors  o shifts in the markets for our products  o development and marketing of products by our competitors  o changes in our relationships with suppliers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  or customers  and o continuing effects of the worldwide economic downturn 
further  the stock market has witnessed unusual volatility with respect to the price of equity securities of high technology companies generally  and this volatility has  at times  appeared to be unrelated to or disproportionate to any of the factors above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk our primary exposures to market risk are the effect of volatility in currencies on asset and liability positions of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies  and the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
foreign currency exchange risk we generally derive approximately half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income loss and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are over or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had million of forward exchange contracts outstanding  denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen  canadian dollars  singapore dollars and australian dollars  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
for the twelve month period ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward exchange contracts were recorded  which offset net transaction and translation gains of million on the related assets and liabilities 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term us and canadian government and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
