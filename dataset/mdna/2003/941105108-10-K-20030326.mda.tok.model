table of contents in august  we introduced our new firebox soho  firebox soho tc  and firebox soho tc user models 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to i revenue recognition  including sales returns and allowances  ii the provision for bad debt  iii inventory reserves  iv restructuring reserves  v the allocation of the purchase price in business combinations to intangible assets and vi analysis of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
the complexity of the revenue recognition rules and estimates inherent in the revenue recognition process makes revenue results difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenues could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we generate revenues through sales of products and service subscriptions indirectly through our distribution network at a discount from list price  sales of products and service subscriptions directly and  from time to time  indirectly through our distributors  to our service provider customers at volume pricing rates  and sales of service subscription renewals directly to end users 
product revenues include sales of our security appliance and the perpetual software license fees for our firebox products that are bundled with the sale of our security appliance as part of our security solutions  revenues from sales of software options  such as user expansion and software management modules  hardware sales of our rapidstream secured by checkpoint line of high performance security appliances  sales of our serverlock products and anti virus solutions for server content  application and desktop security  and revenues from sales of our noc security suite software license as part of our managed security solution 
revenues from products are generally recognized upon delivery if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed and determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair 
table of contents value for undelivered elements of the arrangement has been established 
while we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment  revenues on product sales for some of our major distributors are recorded when these distributors have sold the product to their customers 
service revenues primarily include the initial fees for our livesecurity service subscriptions  which have periods ranging from days to one year and are sold as part of our security solutions  and for livesecurity service subscription renewals  which have periods ranging from one to two years  from our enterprise customers and end users 
these service fees provide our customers access to our livesecurity service for product updates  security threat responses  general security information and technical support 
these service fees also enable our service provider customers access to the livesecurity service and the ability to manage and update a specific number of their customers security appliances 
service subscription revenues are recognized ratably on a monthly basis  generally over periods ranging from days to two years 
when service fees are bundled with the sales of our products in multiple element arrangements  the elements of those arrangements are unbundled using our objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements represented by our customary pricing for each element when sold in separate transactions 
since customers receive the services over a period of time  watchguard determines the fair value of the service portion of the arrangement as an undelivered element  based on the renewal price of the service 
changes in the composition of such multiple element arrangements  our ability to identify the existence of the vendor specific objective evidence for the elements in the arrangement or our ability to estimate the fair value of elements in the arrangement could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
we have established allowances for estimated returns  return rights and pricing protection rights 
we also established an allowance for promotional rebates that may be earned by our customers 
we estimate these reserves and adjust them periodically based on historical rates of returns and allowances  as well as the expected effect of current promotional programs and new product introductions 
we estimate the allowance for promotional rebates based on the maximum amounts potentially available to the customers  unless we accumulate sufficient historic evidence for individual customers with respect to their realization of rebates 
if new or expanded promotional programs are introduced  or new products are announced  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if actual promotional rebates fall below maximum exposure levels  we may reduce the allowances and recognize additional revenue 
bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
significant judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables  including the probability of collection and the creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write our inventories down to estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
variation in market trends  customer preferences and introduction of new products that replace existing products or technological advances could  however  significantly affect these estimates and result in additional inventory write downs 
restructuring in and  we recorded significant accruals related to our restructuring plans 
these accruals included estimates related to the abandonment of excess facilities 
we had to adjust the restructuring accruals due to continued poor real estate market conditions in the areas where these excess facilities are located 
the actual costs related to the restructuring may differ from our estimate if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable 
table of contents tenants for excess facilities or if there are further changes in the real estate market in those areas where excess facilities are located 
any additional adjustments resulting from these factors could have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
accounting for goodwill and other intangibles our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired as well as capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
required business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value of those assets exceeds their fair value 
before  we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of five years 
with the required adoption of sfas no 
 beginning january   we no longer amortize goodwill into earnings 
sfas no 
prescribes the use of the two phase approach for testing goodwill for impairment 
the first phase is a screen for potential impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  measures the amount of impairment  if any 
during we completed our first phase impairment analysis and found no instances of impairment 
accordingly  the second testing phase was not required 
separable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
these assets are also periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business in accounting principles board opinion no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying value of intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
acquisition of rapidstream  inc on april   we acquired rapidstream  a privately held provider of high performance  asic based firewall and vpn appliances 
the acquisition of rapidstream brought advanced asic technology and a family of high performance systems that allows us to address customers that require a high performance security solution with enterprise level networking functionality and vpn scalability 
immediately after the rapidstream acquisition  watchguard announced a partnership with check point to deliver a new class of high performance vpn and security appliances integrating check point next generation software 
these secured by check point appliances were developed by rapidstream 
the acquisition of rapidstream had a significant impact on our financial position and operating results in specifically product revenues increased during due to sales of asic based products originating from our acquisition of rapidstream  which we began shipping late in the second quarter of given the current economic uncertainty  however  it is difficult to predict revenue levels in future quarters  product returns may increase due to sales of future products resulting from the acquisition  
table of contents stock based compensation increased due to deferred stock based compensation associated with the acquisition  we recorded additional amounts for goodwill and other intangible assets  amortization expense on definite lived intangibles increased  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the second quarter of and an additional million was recorded in the fourth quarter of  as we implemented a plan primarily designed to eliminate redundancies and excess headcount resulting from the acquisition 
this plan included a reduction in workforce  consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of technology related contracts that are no longer required or part of our strategy  and we expended approximately million in cash in the second quarter of for consideration paid as part of the purchase price  acquisition related costs and additional costs of closing 
this expenditure was partially offset by million in cash held by rapidstream at the time of the acquisition 
results of operations the following table provides financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  revenues product service total revenues cost of revenues product service total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of goodwill amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired acquired in process technology restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss years ended december  and revenues total revenues  which consist of product revenues and service revenues  increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
the increase in total revenues reflects a increase in service revenues and a increase in product revenues 
the increase in service revenues resulted from 
table of contents amortization of previous deferrals attributable to bundled product revenues and amortization of the renewals of livesecurity service subscriptions by our existing customer base 
the increase in product revenues reflects an increase in units shipped as a result of new product releases and improved sales channel performance 
we categorize our revenues into three geographic regions the americas  europe middle east africa  or emea  and asia pacific  or apac 
revenue information by geographic region  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  americas emea apac total revenue information for countries representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  united states japan united kingdom less than revenue information for customers representing more than of total revenues  in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  tech data ingram micro cdw less than product revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in  due to a lower growth rate associated with continued slowing of economic conditions  and an increase in service revenues from an increased base of customers renewing their livesecurity service subscriptions 
given the current economic uncertainty and slowdown in capital spending  it is difficult to predict product revenue levels in future quarters  which may remain depressed or fluctuate more than they have historically 
we may be unable to maintain or increase the demand for our products  our revenues may not continue to grow at the same rate as in the past or at the rate expected  and we may be unable to achieve similar results in future periods 
service revenues increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
the increase in service revenues is due to a greater number of installed products in and to an increase in livesecurity service renewals 
as a percentage of total revenues  service revenues increased from in to in  which reflects an increased base of customers renewing their livesecurity service subscriptions and a reduced growth rate for product sales 
we expect a slower growth rate of service revenue in 
table of contents the provision for sales returns and allowances was million  or of total revenues before returns and allowances  in and million  or of total revenues before returns and allowances  in the higher provision in reflects the major product replacement of the firebox ii with the firebox iii undertaken in  in combination with related promotional rebates associated with selling residual firebox ii inventory and the introduction of firebox iii products 
the decrease in the provision in as a percentage of revenue reflects improved trends in actual returns and allowances 
we expect to continue to introduce new products each year  which may affect our reserve for sales returns and allowances 
cost of revenues and gross margin total cost of revenues  which includes product and service costs  decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of revenues decreased from in to in correspondingly  gross margins  as a percentage of total revenues  increased from in to in gross margins are affected by various factors  including the volume discount levels contained in our channel partner agreements  the cost of our firebox and rapidstream secured by check point appliances  expense associated with a provision for inventory reserves  lower of cost or market assessment of inventory carrying value  fixed manufacturing overhead  the mix of product and service sales  which may include hardware and software products and service subscriptions  or both  the cost of royalties associated with our products  promotional programs  and the costs of our technical support organization and livesecurity service 
cost of product revenues  which includes the cost of manufacturing our security appliances  distribution operations  product packaging and third party product licensing fees  decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from in to in and  as a percentage of product revenues  decreased from in to in the dollar and percentage decrease of cost of product revenues in is due to the introduction of new products with higher product margins and more favorable pricing obtained from original equipment manufacturers 
we expect an absolute dollar increase in cost of product revenues in  if we achieve the expected increase in shipments 
we expect product gross margins to increase in  primarily as a result of increased volume combined with a more favorable product mix aimed at a greater quantity of higher margin products 
however  our gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by competitive selling pressures  the impact on the existing inventory values when replacement products are introduced and availability of key components 
cost of service revenues  which includes the costs of our technical support organization and costs associated with our livesecurity service  increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  cost of service revenues decreased from in to in and  as a percentage of service revenues  cost of service decreased from in to in the percentage decrease in cost of service revenue is primarily due to a broader customer base 
we expect service costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as our user base expands 
in the longer term  as revenues from livesecurity service subscriptions increase and account for a greater percentage of total revenues  we expect our service margins to increase 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and employee related expenses and certain variable marketing expenses  including distributor promotional costs  public relations costs  marketing collateral and trade show expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in to in the dollar increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases in payroll and related costs from headcount increases associated with the realignment of our sales and marketing organization beginning in the fourth quarter of and from the rapid stream 
table of contents acquisition  and to higher commissions expense associated with increased revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in travel expenditures 
specifically  salaries  commissions  recruiting  consulting and related expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in in absolute dollars in connection with our continued investment in sales and marketing programs designed to increase distribution through our reseller network 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we focus on improving depth and productivity of our existing channel partners 
research and development 
research and development expenses include salaries  costs of noncapitalized equipment and software tools  depreciation of capital equipment and software  costs associated with our security appliance prototypes and payments to designers and contractors 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased from in to in due to the revenue increase being greater than the increase in research and development expenses 
the dollar increase in research and development expenses reflects the increased employee related expenses resulting from the rapidstream acquisition  as well as product integration costs to accelerate the rollout of new products associated with the rapidstream acquisition 
specifically  major components of the increase included an increase in payroll and related expenses from million to million  the majority of which is a result of our acquisition of rapidstream  and an increase in security appliance prototype development and consulting costs from million to million  related to expanded product offerings in and integration of the new rapidstream and firebox products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decline as a percentage of revenue in we will continue to provide sufficient funding to our research and development effort in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  to ensure continued development of new products as technology advances  and to enhance and expand our current product offerings 
general and administrative

general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in due to the revenue increase being greater than the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses reflects the expansion of our infrastructure to manage the growth of our operations 
the increase was partially offset by the reduction in bad debt expenses 
the fluctuations in major components of total general and administrative expenses included an increase in payroll and consulting and related expenses from million to million  the majority of which is related to our acquisition of rapidstream  an increase in business insurance from  to  primarily reflecting changes in market price for premiums for directors and officers insurance  and a  decrease in bad debt expense as a result of tighter credit policies implemented during a period of changing global economic conditions and fewer small direct channel customers 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and decline as a percentage of revenue in  as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and our operation as a public company  including new regulatory and corporate governance requirements 

table of contents stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expenses arise from amortization of previously deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of common stock subject to repurchase and stock options 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation expenses was million in and million in in  the allocation of stock based compensation expense was  for sales and marketing  million for research and development and  for general and administrative 
in  the allocation of the stock based compensation expenses associated with the functional operating expense categories was  for sales and marketing  million for research and development  and  for general and administrative 
deferred stock based compensation is recorded as a component of stockholders equity as the difference between the exercise price of options and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  and for the value of common stock subject to repurchase that we issued in connection with our october acquisition of beadlenet  our october acquisition of qiave and our april acquisition of rapidstream 
in addition  deferred stock based compensation is recorded for the fair value of stock options granted to consultants 
we recorded  of deferred stock based compensation in in connection with the rapidstream acquisition 
amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill related to our acquisitions of beadlenet and qiave was million in amortization of goodwill was discontinued in due to the adoption on january  of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be periodically reviewed for impairment 
during the last quarter of  we performed the required annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
no impairment of goodwill was identified 
amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired 
amortization of other intangible assets acquired consists of amortization of capitalized technology and other definite lived intangibles related to our acquisitions of qiave and rapidstream 
the intangible assets associated with our acquisition of beadlenet in were fully amortized in we are amortizing the intangible assets on a straight line basis over useful lives ranging from two to five years 
we recorded amortization charges related to these intangible assets of million in and we recorded amortization and impairment of these intangible assets of million in the increase in amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired in resulted primarily from the following major factors 
during the fourth quarter of  we developed a business plan that  because of limited resources  de emphasized further development and integration of the qiave technology 
separately  we continued to realize lower than expected revenue from products based on qiave technology 
as a result  the expected future cash flows were determined to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the qiave capitalized technology 
we therefore recorded an impairment charge of million of capitalized technology related to the acquisition of qiave 
in  we recorded million amortization of new intangible assets related to the acquisition of rapidstream 
we expect our amortization of other intangible assets to decrease in compared to due to the impairment charge described above 
acquired in process technology 
acquired in process technology expenses of million in consists of in process research and development  or ipr d  expense related to our acquisition of rapidstream 
restructuring charges 
we carried out restructuring plans in both and in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan designed to streamline operations and reduce operating costs 
this restructuring plan included a reduction in workforce and a consolidation of excess facilities  in addition to other cost saving strategies

all these employees were terminated prior to june  other expenses associated with the reorganization consisted of stock based compensation expense associated with the acceleration of vesting of stock subject to repurchase and stock options held by terminated employees  the discontinuation of the consumer security market products and the abandonment of facilities and equipment 
costs that related to ongoing operations were not included as restructuring charges 
all restructuring charges have been paid as of december   except accrued amounts primarily related to losses for the lease buyout or sublease of abandoned facilities  which are expected to be realized through august revenues recorded from the consumer security market were insignificant prior to the restructuring 
the charges recorded to results of operations in and  related to the restructuring plan of  were as follows in thousands restructuring charges in restructuring charges in severance and termination benefits stock based compensation abandoned facilities and other total in the second quarter of  we implemented a second restructuring plan primarily designed to eliminate redundancies and excess headcount resulting from the acquisition of rapidstream  which included a reduction in workforce  consolidation of excess facilities and elimination of technology related contracts that are no longer required or part of our strategy

 consolidated statement of operations data revenues product service total revenues cost of revenues product service total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative stock based compensation amortization of goodwill amortization and impairment of other intangible assets acquired acquired in process technology restructuring charges total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss during and  global economic  political and other uncertainties  as well as constrained corporate information technology spending  appeared to slow the demand for our products and services 
like most companies in the technology sector  we are experiencing a downturn in the growth rate of revenues that began in the fourth quarter of and continues through the fourth quarter of we believe that both our revenues and our operating results for the eight quarter period presented above were negatively affected by the worldwide economic conditions and an overall reduction in capital spending by businesses 
additionally  revenues and operating results for the fourth quarter of were negatively affected by changes in our sales and marketing organizations and a realignment of our distribution and channel partner strategy 
while these changes of our sales and marketing organizations negatively affected our revenues and operating results in the fourth quarter of  we believe they were required to compete effectively in the global internet security market 
as a result of this realignment  as well as due to the decreases in both sales returns and allowances  we achieved greater revenues sequentially for each of the four quarters of given the current economic uncertainty and slowdown in capital spending  it is difficult to predict product revenue levels in future quarters  which may remain depressed or fluctuate more than they have historically 
we may be unable to maintain or increase the demand for our products  our revenues may not continue to grow at the same rate as in the past or at the rate expected  and we may be unable to achieve similar results in future periods 
beginning in the first quarter of  sequential quarterly revenues increased by million  million  million and million  resulting in total revenues of million  million  million and 
table of contents million for the four sequential quarters of the revenues in the second  third and fourth quarters of were higher than the revenues in the second quarter of  which was the highest revenue level achieved in our gross margins in  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  remained relatively flat until the fourth quarter of  when we experienced a sharp decline in gross margins 
gross margins in the fourth quarter of were affected by the factors described above  as well as by a change in product mix that resulted in a higher concentration of lower priced  lower margin products being sold  fixed manufacturing overhead and customer support costs spread over a smaller revenue base  and the write down of existing firebox ii products and related assets 
during  firebox ii product promotional programs that we established to facilitate the introduction of the new firebox iii product line also negatively affected gross margins 
our gross margins  both in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  have increased sequentially in each of the four quarters of beginning with the gross margins of the fourth quarter of  primarily due to higher revenues  including revenues from the initial sale of asic based products  a product mix of higher margin products  and a nonrecurring write down of firebox ii products in the fourth quarter of overall  our total operating expenses have fluctuated  in dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in the eight quarter period ended december   due primarily to the acquisition of rapidstream in and to restructuring charges in both and the components of the total operating expenses fluctuated as follows sales and marketing expenses increased in the first two quarters of compared to the last quarter of and were relatively flat for the third and fourth quarters of the higher sales and marketing expenses in reflect changes in our sales and marketing organizations and the realignment of our distribution and channel partner strategy  as well as increased sales commissions associated with increased revenues 
research and development expenses increased in the second quarter of as a result of the rapidstream acquisition  reflecting additional personnel and general development costs  and returned to the level comparable to that of by the last quarter of  as a result of eliminating duplicate resources during our restructuring in the second quarter of general and administrative expenses have been relatively stable for the eight quarter period ended december  stock based compensation charges  associated mainly with the acquisition of qiave in october  have decreased each sequential quarter since the third quarter of  due primarily to recognizing a much larger portion of the expense in the early quarters after an acquisition 
amortization of goodwill was recorded in all quarters of  but was discontinued in the first quarter of as a result of the required adoption of sfas no 
on january  amortization of other intangible assets acquired increased in the second quarter of as we capitalized technology acquired in connection with the rapidstream acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge of the capitalized technology related to the acquisition of qiave  as we revised downwards our estimate of future cash flow streams from products based on this technology 
ipr d expense was recorded as a one time cost in the second quarter of in connection with the acquisition of rapid stream 
restructuring charges were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of and the second and fourth quarters of associated with our and restructuring plans 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised upwards our estimates of restructuring losses on abandoned facilities due to the continued poor real estate market conditions in the areas where these excess facilities are located 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which were invested primarily in high quality money market accounts and marketable securities 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not material 
we currently have outstanding a million unconditional letter of credit that we issued in september to our landlord in conjunction with the building lease for our corporate headquarters 
currently  our letter of credit is collateralized by short term investments with our bank 
our working capital as of december  was million 
operating activities our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million in and million in the operating cash outflows during these periods resulted primarily from significant investments in sales and marketing and research and development  all of which led to operating losses 
net losses for and exceeded cash used in operating activities primarily as a result of non cash charges included in net losses totaling million in and million in these non cash charges were primarily associated with the amortization and impairment of other intangibles  amortization of goodwill in  depreciation and amortization of capital assets  and compensation charges resulting from the issuance of stock options and common stock subject to repurchase by watchguard 
cash provided by working capital components for operating activities was million in and million in in  there were large fluctuations within some of our major working capital components  as described below a net receivables increased from million at december  to million at december   primarily reflecting the increase in revenues from million for the three months ended december  to million for the three months ended december  days sales outstanding  or dsos  calculated on a quarterly basis  improved from days at december  to days at december  dsos are affected by the payment terms contained in our customer contracts  risks associated with the uncertain economy  whether revenues in a particular quarter are linear that is  are evenly distributed throughout the quarter or weighted more toward the end of the quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue contained in the receivable balance that has not been recognized as revenue 
based on our current sales mix  the linearity of revenues in past and future quarters  timing differences arising from the varying payment terms in our customer agreements and the growth of deferred revenue  we expect our dsos to generally range from to days in the future 
any change in these factors  however  could negatively affect expected dso results 
b accounts payable and accrued expenses increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase resulted from corresponding increases in sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses in the last quarter of compared to the last quarter of those expenses increased from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of c accrued restructuring and acquisition costs increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase is related primarily to the remaining million of acquisition liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of rapid stream  and to the remaining amounts of the restructuring liabilities of  for the restructuring plan and million for the restructuring plan as of december  d deferred revenue increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase reflects the deferral of revenue from bundled livesecurity service subscriptions included in new product revenues and renewals of livesecurity service subscriptions from a growing customer base 

table of contents investing activities cash provided by investing activities was  in and  in during  these activities primarily related to short term investment of the proceeds received from our public offerings  offset by capital expenditures for equipment and furniture 
during  these activities primarily related to short term investment of the proceeds received from our public offerings  offset by the net cash consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of rapidstream 
to complete the acquisition of rapidstream  we expended approximately million in cash in  net of acquired rapidstream cash balances  including consideration paid as part of the purchase price  settlement of acquisition related costs and additional costs of closing 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in both periods reflects the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our existing cash and securities balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the increased operating expenses associated with the acquisition of rapidstream  for other potential acquisitions or technology investments  for our announced plan to potentially repurchase up to million of our common stock and for our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may need to seek additional funding before that time through public or private financings or other arrangements  however  if the underlying assumed levels of spending for other potential acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses or technologies prove to be inaccurate 
contractual obligations we lease office space and some computer equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
our facilities commitments include a lease for our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington  which expires in september we have the option to extend this lease for an additional five year term 
we also lease a product fulfillment and distribution warehouse in seattle  with a lease term through april we lease facilities in aliso viejo and san jose  california and waltham  massachusetts under operating leases that expire in years between and  in addition to leases for other sales offices under operating leases or other lease obligations that expire over various terms 
our excess facilities at our corporate headquarters in seattle  and in aliso viejo and san jose  california  are partially subleased to tenants  with sublease terms that expire between and we also have several operating leases for computer equipment 
watchguard is also a party to several noncancelable and nonrefundable agreements to purchase inventory 
our contractual commitments at december  associated with lease obligations  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities  net of future minimum rental income from subleases of million  are as follows in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total other commitments in the event that the average of the high and low sales prices of watchguard common stock on april   the first anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition of rapidstream  is less than the average of the 
table of contents high and low sales prices of watchguard common stock on april   the closing date of the merger  watchguard will make an aggregate cash payment to the former holders of rapidstream common stock equal to the product of multiplied by the difference between i the average trading price on the closing date   discounted to reflect the effect on fair market value of the lockup restrictions on the shares of watchguard common stock issued to the former rapidstream shareholders and ii the average trading price on the first anniversary of the closing date  multiplied by the number of shares of watchguard common stock issued to and held by the former holders of rapidstream common stock  or up to approximately  shares 
watchguard expects that any payment  if required  would not be material to its financial position 
this payment  if required  will be a downward adjustment to the additional paid in capital  reflecting the reduction in value of securities issued in the transaction 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or derivative equity securities in our investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio or million per issuer at the time of purchase  with the exception of us treasury and agency securities and money market funds  which are exempt from this size limitation 
our policy limits all investments to those that mature in two years or less  with the average maturity of our investments equal to one year or less 
the securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly affected by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio  which is summarized in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk 
all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are currently denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses 
while we incurred some expenses in foreign currencies during and and expect to continue to do so in the future  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be material to us 
although we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  we may do so in the future
