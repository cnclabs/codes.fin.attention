item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in october we commenced operations in november  following our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and certain of the liabilities of partec ltd  our predecessor company that began its operations in january since commencing operations  our activities have been primarily devoted to developing our technologies  raising capital  purchasing assets for our corporate offices and laboratory facilities and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private placements of equity securities and from our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
we have two wholly owned operating subsidiaries  keryx biomedical technologies ltd 
and keryx israel ltd  which engage in research and development activities and administrative activities in israel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development  facilities related and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our product candidates  as well as expenses related to in licensing or acquisition of new product candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including business development  general legal activities and facilities related expenses 
our results of operations include non cash compensation expense as a result of the grants of stock  stock options and warrants 
compensation expense for options and warrants granted represents the intrinsic value the difference between the stock price of the common stock and the exercise price of the options or warrants of the options and warrants at the date of grant  as well as the difference between the stock price at reporting date and the exercise price  in the case where a measurement date has not been reached 
we account for stock based employee and director compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  as allowed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
compensation for options and warrants granted to consultants and other third parties has been determined in accordance with sfas no 
 as the fair value of the equity instruments issued  and according to the guidelines set forth in eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
the compensation cost is recorded over the respective vesting periods of the individual stock options and warrants 
the expense is included in the respective categories of expense in the statement of operations 
we expect to record additional non cash compensation expense in the future  which may be significant 
however  because some of the options and warrants issued to employees  consultants and other third parties either do not vest immediately or vest upon the achievement of certain milestones  the total expense is uncertain 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
in applying these critical accounting policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in making certain estimates 
these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our critical accounting policies include the following foreign currency translation 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we translate non us dollar amounts in the financial statements of our israeli subsidiaries into us dollars 
under the relevant accounting guidance the treatment of any gains or losses resulting from this translation is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiaries 
generally  the currency in which a subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency 
however  any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included as a separate part of our stockholders equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
however  if the functional currency of the subsidiary is deemed to be the us dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the us dollar to be the functional currency for each of our israeli subsidiaries because the majority of the transactions of each subsidiary  including billings  payroll  taxes and other major obligations  are conducted using the us dollar 
therefore all gains and losses from translations are recorded in our statement of operations 
had we used the israeli currency as the functional currency of our subsidiaries  exchange gains and losses would have been treated as other comprehensive income  included in a statement of comprehensive income 
we believe that the amount of such comprehensive income in would not have been material 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have fully offset our us deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
our lack of earnings history and the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate taxable income prior to the expiration of such deferred tax assets were the primary factors considered by management in establishing the valuation allowance 
the deferred tax asset in our financial statements relates to our wholly owned israeli subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries continue to generate taxable income in respect of services provided within the group  and therefore we believe that the deferred tax asset relating to the israeli subsidiaries will be realized 
in the event that our subsidiaries services would not generate such taxable income  we would need to write off the deferred tax asset as an expense in the statement of operations 
it should be noted that as the income is derived from companies within the consolidated group  it is eliminated upon consolidation 
in september  one of our israeli subsidiaries received the status of an approved enterprise which grants certain tax benefits in israel in accordance with paragraph of the law for the encouragement of capital investments  
through december   this israeli subsidiary will have received tax benefits of approximately  as a result of the subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise 
in june  the subsidiary received formal temporary notification that it had met the requirements for implementation of the benefits under this program 
in january  the subsidiary notified the israeli governmental authority of reductions in its staff and operations that had formed the basis of its approved enterprise program  and requested that the program instituted prior to the cost reductions be approved 
in february  the israeli governmental authority informed this subsidiary that it may be in non compliance with the conditions of its approved enterprise program because of the indicated reductions 
nevertheless  the israeli governmental authority indicated that it will defer any decision in connection with the subsidiary s approved enterprise program until december   and will allow it until such date to meet the objectives of its original program 
in the event that the subsidiary s program is not approved as a result of these cost reductions  we may be liable to repay some or all of the tax benefits received to date  which could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations 
the company is of the opinion that the reduction of its activity should not have a bearing on benefits received as of december  stock compensation 
during historical periods  we have granted options to employees  directors and consultants  as well as warrants to other third parties 
in applying sfas no 
 we use the black scholes pricing model to calculate the fair market value of our options and warrants 
the black scholes model takes into account volatility in the price of our stock  the risk free interest rate  the estimated life of the option or warrant  the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price 
we have assumed for the purposes of the black scholes calculation that an option will be exercised one year after it fully vests 
we base our estimates of our stock price volatility on the volatility during the year prior to the grant of the option or warrant 
however  this estimate is neither predictive nor indicative of the future performance of our stock 
for purposes of the calculation  it was assumed that no dividends will be paid during the life of the options and warrants 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  total compensation expense for options issued to consultants is determined at the measurement date 
the expense is recognized over the vesting period for the options 
until the measurement date is reached  the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain 
we record option compensation based on the fair value of the options at the reporting date 
these options are then revalued  or the total compensation is recalculated based on the then current fair value  at each subsequent reporting date 
this results in a change to the amount previously recorded in respect of the option grant and additional expense or a negative expense may be recorded in subsequent periods based on changes in the assumptions used to calculate fair value  such as changes in market price  until the measurement date is reached and the compensation expense is determined 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
we have adopted sfas no 
from january   accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or used in its disposal 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we have conducted such a review in light of our restructuring in we believe that based upon this review of our future net cash flow estimates for each of drug candidates and our continued use of our assets  there is no need to record an impairment charge as of december  notwithstanding this conclusion  as a result of additional restructuring of our activities in our jerusalem laboratory facility in march  we believe that we will need to record an impairment charge during the first quarter of  although the amount of this impairment charge and other costs associated with the cessation of our jerusalem laboratory activities cannot be determined at this time 
at december   the carrying value of the assets  including fixed assets and patents  that could be impaired  thus resulting in a non cash write down  totaled approximately  we do not believe at this time that we will have to write down such assets completely 
restructuring we implemented a strategic reorganization  initiated in august and continuing through year s end 
the reorganization included staff reductions and pay cuts of 
the program was designed to substantially reduce our early stage research expenditures so that we could focus primarily on our lead product candidate krx for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy  as well as to provide us with the resources to potentially in license additional product candidates 
the reorganization included a person  or approximate  reduction in our work force  including senior management  administrative staff  and research personnel involved in early stage projects 
as of december   employees had left under our restructuring plan 
as part of our focus on the core indication of our lead product  we also announced that we had terminated our aids related kidney disease hivan clinical trial of krx through december   we had total accumulated expenses of approximately  for severance benefits for employees terminated under our reorganization 
consequently  we took a charge of approximately  approximately  of which was included in general and administrative expenses and approximately  of which was included in research and development expenses 
the remaining amount of approximately  had been expensed as part of our ongoing accrual for employee severance benefits in accordance with israeli law 
as of december   employees have left under our restructuring plan and approximately  of severance benefits have been paid 
as of december   approximately  in severance obligations related to our restructuring is included in accrued compensation and related liabilities 
a portion of this amount was formerly included in liability in respect of employee severance obligations and was reclassified to current liabilities after it became short term in nature 
with respect to this liability  we funded deposits in respect to employee severance obligations of approximately  that was reclassified to current assets as it will be redeemed in the short term 
in march  we gave notice of termination to an additional employees  all based in our jerusalem laboratory facility 
as a result  we may also incur other costs related to the further restructuring of our research activities 
the portion of our lease obligations relating to the jerusalem laboratory facility amounts to approximately  through the end of costs of severance benefits for the employees who received notice of termination in march are accrued to balance sheet date as part of the liability in respect of employee severance benefits in accordance with israeli law 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
we did not have any revenue for the years ended december  and december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  including non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants and warrant issuances  increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to increased licensing costs for the in licensing of small integrated building blocks sib technology as well as for the in licensing of the worldwide rights for the manufacturing process of krx  increased personnel and related costs  increased facilities related costs and increased non manufacturing clinical development costs associated with krx these increases were partially offset by a decline in manufacturing expenses associated with the krx clinical trial materials as well as a result of the implementation of cost control measures initiated in august we expect our research and development costs to decrease over the next year as the result of the implementation of our strategic reorganization 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants and warrant issuances was negative  for the year ended december  as compared to negative  for the year ended december  this negative non cash compensation expense was primarily due to the revaluation of previously issued options and warrants to consultants and other third parties as a result of the decline in our stock price pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants and warrant issuances  decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a reduction in outside consulting service costs and as a result of the implementation of cost control measures initiated in august  partially offset by increased severance expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease over the next year as the result of the implementation of our strategic reorganization initiated in august non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was negative  for the year ended december  as compared to  for year ended december  this decrease in non cash compensation expense was primarily due to the revaluation of previously issued options and warrants to consultants and other third parties as a result of the decline in our stock price pursuant to sfas no 
and eitf interest income expense  net 
interest income  net  decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to income of  for the year ended december  the decrease during the year resulted from a lower level of invested funds and the general decline in market interest rates when compared to last year 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to an expense of  for year ended december  the decrease in income tax expense is attributable to the lower income tax rate used for one of our subsidiaries that attained israeli approved enterprise status see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in addition  pursuant to receiving formal temporary notification that it met the requirements for implementation of benefits under the approved enterprise  the subsidiary reversed an income tax liability recorded prior to having received this notification 
as of december   we have recorded a deferred tax asset  arising from book and tax timing differences  and a deferred tax liability against income taxes for the period then ended arising from the potential distribution by the subsidiary of a cash dividend out of retained earnings which were tax exempt due to the approved enterprise status 
income tax expense is attributable to taxable income from the continuing operations of our subsidiaries in israel 
this income is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation and changing prices on our operations were not significant during the periods presented 
years ended december  and revenue 
we did not have any revenue for the years ended december  and december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  this increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to growth in personnel  manufacturing expenses associated with krx clinical trial inventory and increased preclinical work to advance our kinace platform 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was negative  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this negative non cash compensation expense was primarily due to the revaluation of previously issued options to consultants pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and eitf general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to expenses of  for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in non cash compensation offset by increased personnel and management expenses  and increased investments in business development and facilities required to support our growth 
non cash compensation expense related to stock option grants was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  interest income expense  net 
interest income  net  increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to income of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted from a higher level of invested funds due primarily to proceeds from our initial public offering that closed in august  that were invested for a full year in income taxes 
income tax expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to an expense of  for the year ended december  income tax expense is attributable to taxable income from the continuing operations of our subsidiaries in israel 
as of december   we have recorded a deferred tax asset against income taxes  arising from book and tax timing differences  for the period then ended 
income taxes are related to the taxable income of our israeli subsidiaries 
this income is eliminated upon consolidation of our financial statements 
impact of inflation 
the effects of inflation and changing prices on our operations were not significant during the periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations from inception primarily through various private and public financings 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering  and million from private placement issuances of common and preferred stock  including million raised through the contribution by holders of their notes issued by our predecessor company 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and short term securities  a decrease of million from december  cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in cash used in operating activities was due primarily to increased expenses associated with the expansion of our business 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities was primarily the result of the maturity of short term securities  partially offset by capital expenditures 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since our inception 
we anticipate incurring negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts and our clinical trials 
as of december   we have known contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies of  of this amount   relates to research and development agreements  of which  is due during  a total of  is due during and  and  relates to other agreements due during the additional  relates to operating lease obligations  of which  is due during  with the remaining  due during and payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years research development agreements    other agreements   operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    in january  we terminated several sponsored research agreements 
as a result of such terminations  we have reduced our future research and development commitments by approximately  additionally  we have undertaken to make contingent milestone payments to certain of our licensors of up to approximately million over the life of the licenses  which expire from to in certain cases  such payments will reduce any royalties due on sales of related products 
in the event that the milestones are not achieved  we remain obligated to pay one licensor  annually until the license expires 
we believe that our million in cash  cash equivalents  interest receivable and short term securities as of december  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  are invested in highly liquid investments such as cash  money market accounts and short term us corporate debt securities 
as of december   we are unaware of any known trends or any known demands  commitments  events  or uncertainties that will  or that are reasonably likely to  result in a material increase or decrease in our required liquidity 
we expect that our liquidity needs throughout will continue to be funded from existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term securities 
our forecast of the period of time through which our cash  cash equivalents and short term securities will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following o the timing of expenses associated with product development of our proprietary product candidates  especially krx  and including those expected to be in licensed  partnered or acquired  o the timing of the in licensing  partnering and acquisition of new product opportunities  o the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements  o our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements  o the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and o the amount of any funds expended to repurchase our common stock 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our stock or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
nullifies eitf according to sfas  commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a one time charge for most anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and they will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
sfas no 
revises accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   however earlier adoption is encouraged 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
on january  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

safs no 
permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also requires new disclosures about the ramp up effect of stock based employee compensation on reported results 
the statement also requires that those effects be disclosed more prominently by specifying the form  content  and location of those disclosures 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted in certain circumstances 
the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements applicable to fiscal years ending after december   and are considering our position with regard to the adoption of sfas no 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others hereinafter the interpretation  which addresses  among other things  the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
these disclosure requirements are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
we are evaluating the anticipated effect of the recognition provisions of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
as noted above  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation see note and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
we maintain our portfolio in cash equivalents and short and long term interest bearing securities  including corporate debt  money market funds and government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is required 
foreign currency rate fluctuations 
while our israeli subsidiaries transact business in new israel shekels or nis  most operating expenses and commitments are linked to the us dollar 
as a result  there is currently minimal exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
any foreign currency revenues and expenses are translated using the daily average exchange rates prevailing during the year and any transaction gains and losses are included in net income 
in the future  our subsidiaries may enter into nis based commitments that may expose us to foreign currency rate fluctuations
