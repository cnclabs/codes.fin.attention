item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as of february   we believe that approximately million of the million may be forgiven prior to january   although there is no assurance that any of the million may be ultimately forgiven 
otc alliances in december  we entered into a license and supply agreement granting to novartis exclusive rights to market an otc generic claritin loratadine product 
under the terms of the agreement  impax is responsible for developing and manufacturing the product  while novartis is responsible for its marketing and sale 
the structure of the agreement includes milestone payments and a royalty on novartis sales 
in june  we signed a semi exclusive development  license and supply agreement with wyeth relating to our loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets and loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets for the otc market under the alavert tm brand 
impax is responsible for developing and manufacturing the products  while wyeth is responsible for their marketing and sale 
the structure of the agreement includes milestone payments and a royalty on wyeth sales 
in june  we signed a non exclusive licensing  contract manufacturing and supply agreement with schering plough relating to our loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets for the otc market under the claritin d hour brand 
the structure of the agreement includes milestone payments and agreed sales prices 
we commenced shipments to schering plough at the end of january manufacturing we manufacture our finished dosage form products at our san antonio street  hayward  california facility and then package  warehouse and distribute the products from our philadelphia facility 
this strategy allows us to use the lower operating cost and larger philadelphia facility for packaging and warehousing  which requires significant space  while focusing the san antonio street  hayward  california facility on tablet and capsule manufacturing  which requires less space 
the facility currently manufactures loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets  orphenadrine citrate mg extended release tablets  sotalol hydrochloride mg  mg  mg  and mg tablets  methitest tm methyltestosterone tablets  minocycline hydrochloride mg  mg  and mg capsules  fludrocortisone acetate tablets mg  terbutaline sulfate mg and mg tablets  and rimantadine hydrochloride mg tablets 
we began full scale manufacturing in this facility in june and believe we have sufficient capacity to produce new products in the future 
currently  we are using about one third of our estimated annual production capacity of up to approximately billion tablets and capsules 
our research and development activities are situated at huntwood avenue  hayward  california 
we believe this proximity allows for a more efficient transfer and scale up of products from research and development to manufacturing 
currently  our huntwood avenue  hayward  california facility serves as our research and development center and analytical development laboratory  and has a pilot plant that can accommodate our current development work 
this facility will also provide space for the expansion of our development resources in future years 
currently  our philadelphia facility packages and distributes the ten pancreatic enzyme products that comprise our lipram family of products  in addition to the products manufactured in hayward and by others 
a third party  eurand america  inc  for whom we distribute these products under an exclusive license distribution agreement  manufactures the lipram tm family of products 
raw materials the active chemical raw materials  essential to impax s business  are generally readily available from multiple sources in the us and throughout the world 
certain raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are  however  available from limited sources and  in some cases  a single source 
any curtailment in the availability of such raw materials could result in production or other delays and  in the case of products for which only one raw material supplier exists or has been approved by the fda  could result in material loss of sales with consequent adverse effects on impax s business and results of operations 
also  because raw material sources for pharmaceutical products must generally be identified and approved by regulatory authorities  changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays  higher raw material costs  and loss of sales and customers 
impax obtains a portion of its raw materials from foreign suppliers  and its arrangements with such suppliers are subject to  among other risks  fda approval  governmental clearances  export duties  political instability  and restrictions on the transfers of funds 
in addition  recent changes in patent laws in foreign jurisdictions may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for research and development prior to expiration of applicable united states or foreign patents 
any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  or any significant price increases that can not be passed on to customers  could have a material adverse effect on impax laboratories  inc to date  impax has not experienced any significant delays from lack of raw material availability 
however  significant delays may occur in the future 
quality control in connection with the manufacture of drugs  the fda requires testing procedures to monitor the quality of the product  as well as the consistency of its formulation 
we maintain a quality control laboratory that performs  among other things  analytical tests and measurements required to control and release raw materials  in process materials  and finished products 
quality monitoring and testing programs and procedures have been established by us in our effort to assure that all critical activities associated with the production  control  and distribution of our drug products will be carefully controlled and evaluated throughout the process 
by following a series of systematically organized steps and procedures  we seek to assure that established quality standards will be achieved and built into the product 
our policy is to continually seek to meet the highest quality standards  with the goal of thereby assuring the quality  purity  safety  and efficacy of each of our drug products 
we believe that adherence to high operational quality standards will also promote more efficient utilization of personnel  materials  and production capacity 
regulation the federal government extensively regulates all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including the fda  the drug enforcement agency dea  and various state agencies 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  the prescription drug marketing act of pdma  the controlled substances act  the generic drug enforcement act of  and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacture  labeling  testing  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in recalls  seizure of products  injunctions  suspension of production  refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve drug applications  civil and criminal fines  criminal prosecution  and disgorgement of profits 
fda approval is required before any new drug  as defined in section p of the ffdca  may be distributed in interstate commerce 
a drug that is the generic equivalent of a previously approved prescription drug ie  the reference drug or listed drug also requires fda approval 
many otc drugs also require fda pre approval if the otc drug is not covered by  or does not conform to  the conditions specified in an applicable otc drug product monograph and is therefore considered a new drug 
all facilities engaged in the manufacture and packaging and repackaging of drug products must be registered with the fda and are subject to fda inspection to ensure that drug products are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices 
for fiscal year  annual establishment fees for facilities that produce products subject to ndas are approximately  and product listing fees are approximately  per product 
generally  two types of applications are used to obtain fda approval of a new drug new drug application nda for drug products with an active ingredient or ingredients or indications not previously approved by the fda  a prospective manufacturer must submit a complete application containing the results of a clinical study or studies supporting the drug product s safety and efficacy 
these studies may take anywhere from two to five years  or more 
an nda may also be submitted through section b for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved  if the method of delivery is changed  or if the abbreviated procedure discussed below is not available 
currently  fda approval of an nda  on average  is estimated to take approximately to months following submission to the fda 
during fiscal year  user fees to file an nda are approximately  abbreviated new drug application anda the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  referred to as the hatch waxman amendments  established an abbreviated new drug application procedure for obtaining fda approval of generic versions of certain drugs 
an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda waives the requirement that the applicant conduct and submit to the fda clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug 
instead  for drugs that contain the same active ingredient and are of the same route of administration  dosage form  strength and indication s as drugs already approved for use in the united states the reference or listed drug  the fda ordinarily only requires bioavailability data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference drug  indicating that the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the previously approved reference drug product 
according to information published by the fda  the fda currently takes approximately to months on average to approve an anda following the date of its first submission to the fda 
currently  the ffdca does not require applicants to pay user fees for andas 
patent certification requirements for generic drugs could also result in significant delays in obtaining fda approvals 
first  where patents covering a listed drug are alleged to be invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed  the holder or holders of the brand name drug patents may institute patent infringement litigation 
second  the first company to file an anda for a given drug and which certifies that an unexpired patent covering the reference brand name drug is invalid  unenforceable  or will not be infringed by its product  can be awarded days of market exclusivity following approval of its anda during which the fda may not approve any other andas for that drug product 
while the hatch waxman amendments codify the anda mechanism for generic drugs  they also fosters pharmaceutical innovation through incentives that include market exclusivity and patent term extension 
first  the hatch waxman amendments provide two distinct market exclusivity provisions that either preclude the submission or delay the approval of an abbreviated drug application for a drug product 
a five year marketing exclusivity period is provided for new chemical compounds  and a three year marketing exclusivity period is provided for approved applications containing new clinical investigations essential to an approval  such as a new indication for use or new delivery technologies 
the three year marketing exclusivity period would be applicable to  among other things  the development of a novel drug delivery system  as well as a new use 
in addition  companies can obtain six additional months of exclusivity if they perform pediatric studies of a listed drug product 
the marketing exclusivity provisions apply equally to patented and non patented drug products 
second  the hatch waxman amendments provide for patent term extensions to compensate for patent protection lost due to time taken in conducting fda required clinical studies and during fda review of ndas 
patent term extension may not exceed five additional years  nor may the total period of patent protection following fda marketing approval be extended beyond years 
in addition  by virtue of the uruguay round agreements act of that ratified the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt  certain brand name drug patent terms have been extended to years from the date of filing of the pertinent patent application which can be longer than the former patent term of years from date of issuance of a patent 
these extensions can further delay anda effective dates 
patent term extensions may delay the ability of impax to use its proprietary technology in the future to market new extended release products  file section b ndas referencing approved products see below  and file andas based on listed drugs when those approved products or listed drugs have acquired patent term extensions 
with respect to any drug with active ingredients not previously approved by the fda  a prospective manufacturer must submit a full nda  including complete reports of pre clinical  clinical  and other studies to prove that product s safety and efficacy for its intended use or uses 
an nda may also need to be submitted for a drug with a previously approved active ingredient if  among other things  the drug will be used to treat an indication for which the drug was not previously approved  if the method of delivery is changed  or if the abbreviated procedure discussed above is otherwise not available 
a manufacturer intending to conduct clinical trials for a new drug compound as part of an nda is required first to submit an investigational new drug ind application to the fda containing information relating to pre clinical and planned clinical studies 
the full nda process is expensive and time consuming 
controlled or extended release versions of approved immediate release drugs will require the filing of an nda 
the fda will not accept andas when the delivery system or duration of drug availability differs significantly from the listed drug 
however  the ffdca provides for nda submissions that may rely in whole or in part on publicly available clinical data on safety and efficacy under section b of the ffdca 
we may be able to rely on the existing safety and efficacy data for a chemical entity in filing ndas for extended release products when the data exists for an approved immediate release version of that chemical entity 
however  the fda may not accept our applications under section b  or that the existing data may not be available or useful 
utilizing the section b nda process is uncertain because we have not had significant experience with it 
additionally  under the prescription drug user fee act of  as amended by the prescription drug user fee amendments of  all ndas require the payment of a substantial fee upon filing  and other establishment and product fees must be paid annually after approval 
these fees increase on an annual government fiscal year basis 
no assurances exist that  if approval of an nda is required  the approval can be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
pdma  which amends various sections of the ffdca  requires  among other things  state licensing of wholesale distributors of prescription drugs under federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage  handling  and recordkeeping 
it also sets forth civil and criminal fines and penalties for violations of these and other provisions 
the states and the fda are still implementing various sections of the pdma 
nevertheless  failure to comply with the wholesale distribution provisions and other requirements of the pdma could have a materially adverse effect on impax s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
among the requirements for new drug approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s facility  production methods and recordkeeping practices  among other factors  conform to fda regulations on current good manufacturing practices 
the current good manufacturing practices regulations must be followed at all times when the approved drug is manufactured 
in complying with the standards set forth in the current good manufacturing practices regulations  the manufacturer must expend time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical and regulatory compliance 
failure to comply can result in possible fda actions  such as the suspension of manufacturing  seizure of finished drug products  injunctions  consent orders  payment of civil and criminal fines  civil and criminal penalties  and disgorgement of profits 
federal  state and local laws of general applicability  such as laws regulating working conditions  also govern us 
the generic drug enforcement act of establishes penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
in general  fda is authorized to temporarily bar companies  or temporarily or permanently bar individuals  from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market off patent drugs under certain circumstances 
in addition to debarment  fda has numerous discretionary disciplinary powers  including the authority to withdraw approval of an anda or to approve an anda under certain circumstances and to suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct 
we are subject to the maximum allowable cost mac regulations which limit reimbursements for certain generic prescription drugs under medicare  medicaid  and other programs to the lowest price at which these drugs are generally available 
in many instances  only generic prescription drugs fall within the mac regulations limits 
generally  the methods of reimbursement and fixing of reimbursement levels are under active review by federal  state and local governmental entities  as well as by private third party reimbursers 
at present  the justice department and us attorneys offices and state attorneys general have initiated investigations  reviews  and litigation into pharmaceutical pricing and promotional practices 
we cannot predict the results of those reviews  investigations  and litigation or their impact on our business 
virtually every state  as well as the district of columbia  has enacted legislation permitting the substitution of equivalent generic prescription drugs for brand name drugs where authorized or not prohibited by the prescribing physician  and currently states mandate generic substitution in medicaid programs 
environmental laws we are subject to comprehensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern  among other things  air polluting emissions  waste water discharges  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and the remediation of contamination associated with current or past generation handling and disposal activities  including the past practices of corporations as to which we are the successor 
we are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by various environmental regulatory agencies 
a phase i environmental study was conducted with respect to our philadelphia plant and operations in and all environmental compliance issues that were identified at that time  including the discovery of asbestos in certain areas of the plant and the existence of underground oil storage tanks  have been resolved 
we periodically monitor compliance with applicable environmental laws 
there can be no assurance that future changes in environmental laws or regulations  administrative actions or enforcement actions  or remediation obligations arising under environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on impax s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
employees as of february   we employed approximately full time employees 
of these employees  approximately are in operations  are in research and development  work in the quality area  are in administration  and work in sales and marketing 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements with labor unions  and we believe our employee relations are good

item legal proceedings patent litigation there has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical  biological  and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture  use  and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights 
one or more patents cover most of the brand name controlled release products for which we are developing generic versions 
under the hatch waxman amendments  when a drug developer files an anda for a generic drug  and the developer believes that an unexpired patent which has been listed with the fda as covering that brand name product will not be infringed by the developer s product or is invalid or unenforceable  the developer must so certify to the fda 
that certification must also be provided to the patent holder  who may challenge the developer s certification of non infringement  invalidity or unenforceability by filing a suit for patent infringement within days of the patent holder s receipt of such certification 
if the patent holder files suit  the fda can review and approve the anda  but is prevented from granting final marketing approval of the product until a final judgment in the action has been rendered or months from the date the certification was received  whichever is sooner 
should a patent holder commence a lawsuit with respect to an alleged patent infringement by us  the uncertainties inherent in patent litigation make the outcome of such litigation difficult to predict 
the delay in obtaining fda approval to market our product candidates as a result of litigation  as well as the expense of such litigation  whether or not we are successful  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patent litigation will be resolved prior to the month period 
as a result  even if the fda were to approve a product upon expiration of the month period  we may be prevented from marketing that product if patent litigation is still pending 
litigation has been filed against us in connection with twelve of our paragraph iv filings 
the outcome of such litigation is difficult to predict because of the uncertainties inherent in patent litigation 
astrazeneca ab et al 
v 
impax the omeprazole cases in may  astrazeneca ab and four of its related companies filed suit against impax in the united states district court in wilmington  delaware claiming that impax s submission of an abbreviated new drug application for omeprazole delayed release capsules  mg and mg  constitutes infringement of six us patents relating to astrazeneca s prilosec product 
the action seeks an order enjoining impax from marketing omeprazole delayed release capsules  mg and mg  until february   and awarding costs and attorney fees 
there is no claim for damages 
in february  astrazeneca and the same related companies filed the same suit against impax in the same federal court in delaware for infringement  based upon impax s amendment to its anda adding mg strength omeprazole delayed release capsules 
astrazeneca filed essentially the same lawsuits against nine other generic pharmaceutical companies andrx  genpharm  cheminor  kremers  lek  eon  mylan  apotex  and zenith 
due to the number of these cases  a multidistrict litigation proceeding  in re omeprazole mg  mg  and mg delayed released capsules patent litigation  mdl  has been established to coordinate pre trial proceedings 
both lawsuits filed by astrazeneca et al 
against impax have been transferred to the multidistrict litigation 
early in the multidistrict litigation  the trial court ruled that one of the six patents in suit was not infringed by the sale of a generic omeprazole product and that another is invalid 
in particular  the patent omeprazole in combination with clarithromycin in the treatment of h 
pylori  combination therapy for h 
pylori related disease  and the patent h 
pylori treatment were declared invalid either in pre trial summary proceedings or after the trial described below 
the trial court also ruled that the sulphenamide salt of omeprazole was not infringed in related summary proceedings 
these rulings effectively eliminated these four patents from the trial of these infringement cases  although astrazeneca may appeal these decisions as part of the overall appeal process in the case 
on october   after a day long trial involving andrx  genpharm  cheminor  and kremers  the trial judge handling the multidistrict litigation rendered a page opinion that ruled on astrazeneca s complaints that these four defendants the first wave defendants infringed the remaining patents in suit 
most importantly  the trial judge ruled that three of the first wave defendants  andrx  genpharm  and cheminor  infringed the and patents asserted by astrazeneca in its complaints  and that those patents are valid until the court construed the specific language of those two related patents and found that each of these three first wave defendants proposed to manufacture their generic equivalents of omeprazole using a process that employed an alkaline reacting compound  which the trial court said was defined in the patent to include disodium hydrogen phosphate a substance also used in impax s formulation  to create a stabilizing alkaline protective microenvironment around active omeprazole particles in the core region 
the trial court also construed the language of these patents to require that an inert subcoating be disposed on the core 
the court said that the language of the patents should be construed to mean that such a subcoating might be created in situ by some reaction between elements of the core and an enteric coating 
the court held that the formulations employed by andrx  genpharm  and cheminor met these patent requirements as well  and that these three first wave defendants thus infringed both the and patents 
in the same ruling  the trial court ruled that the remaining first wave defendant  kremers  did not infringe either the or the patent 
this defendant s formulation differed from the formulation used by the other first wave defendants in several respects 
among other things  the trial court s opinion stated that kremers does not use an alkaline reacting compound in its core 
the formulation that impax would employ in manufacturing its generic equivalent of omeprazole has not been publicly announced 
impax s formulation has elements that resemble those of other first wave defendants  but it also has elements that differ 
although the ruling by the trial court in the multidistrict litigation has significant effect on the course of astrazeneca s litigation against impax  application of the trial court s opinion is not certain 
impax believes that it has defenses to astrazeneca s claims of infringement  but the opinion rendered by the trial court in the first wave cases makes the outcome of astrazeneca s litigation against impax less certain 
in december  following proceedings before a special master appointed to supervise discovery in the case  the trial court entered a new scheduling order governing pre trial proceedings relating to the six second wave defendants  including impax 
the timing of further proceedings in this litigation may be adversely affected by the appellate proceedings that have been commenced by astrazeneca and several of the first wave defendants 
under the scheduling order entered by the court  discovery and pretrial proceedings have already commenced  with the parties exchanging additional document requests and interrogatories 
depositions of fact witnesses commenced on february  and  under the scheduling order  must be completed by june expert witness depositions will occur thereafter and must be completed by mid august two of the second wave defendants filed motions for summary judgment of non infringement based upon judge jones october ruling 
the trial court has deferred ruling on those motions until discovery is completed 
under the scheduling order  any further motions for summary judgment must be filed by mid september and will be heard by the trial court later in the fall of impax may well file a motion for summary judgment of non infringement following the close of discovery 
if the case is not summarily resolved as by summary judgment  the case involving impax will be returned to the us district court in delaware for trial 
a possibility exists that the case will be transferred back to new york for a consolidated trial before the same judge who decided the first wave cases 
trial will commence as soon as practicable thereafter 
if impax does not file a motion for summary judgment or if such a motion is denied  impax will press the court to schedule a date for trial of the case in  but no assurance can be given that trial will commence at any particular time 
impax believes  however  that any trial that might be scheduled in the case will commence no later than early impax is vigorously defending the action brought by astrazeneca 
impax s defense of the action is being conducted under an insurance policy issued by aig  which pays a portion of the costs of impax s defense of astrazeneca s suit see insurance below 
in march   astrazeneca advised all of the defendants in the multidistrict litigation that four new patents had been added to the fda s orange book as omeprazole patents 
impax filed paragraph iv certifications asserting that  to its knowledge  its omeprazole mg  mg  and mg delayed released capsules will not infringe valid claims of the four newly listed patents 
the forty five day period for astrazeneca to file suit against impax under the four patents expired on august  astrazeneca did not file suit on these patents against impax or any other generic company that filed paragraph iv certifications for these patents 
abbott laboratories et al 
v 
impax the fenofibrate capsule cases in august  abbott laboratories and fournier industrie et santee and a related company  filed suit against impax in the united states district court in chicago  illinois claiming that impax s submission of an anda for fenofibrate micronized capsules  mg  constitutes infringement of a us patent owned by fournier and exclusively licensed to abbott  relating to abbott s tricor product 
in december  abbott and fournier filed a second action against impax in the same court making the same claims against impax s mg fenofibrate micronized capsules 
a third action was filed for impax s mg fenofibrate micronized capsules in march all three actions seek an injunction preventing impax from marketing its fenofibrate products until january   and an award of damages for any commercial manufacture  use  or sale of impax s fenofibrate product  together with costs and attorney fees 
abbott and fournier have filed essentially the same lawsuits against novopharm and teva  also in the us district court in chicago 
impax responded to the complaints by filing an answer asserting that its proposed generic fenofibrate product does not infringe the patent in suit and by asserting that the patent in suit is invalid and not enforceable against impax 
in march  judge darrah granted novopharm s motion for summary judgment of non infringement 
the grounds for finding non infringement by novopharm were directly applicable to impax 
impax filed its own motion for summary judgment of non infringement before judge gottschall  the judge who is presiding over the impax case 
in the interim  abbott appealed judge darrah s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
impax has filed a brief in that appeal as a friend of court  although impax is not directly a party to the appeal 
on march   the court of appeals upheld the lower court s decision 
on march   judge gottschall ruled that impax s product does not infringe on abbott s patent 
an appeal by abbott is likely 
impax is vigorously defending the action brought by abbott labs under an insurance policy issued by aig  which pays a portion of the costs of impax s defense of abbott s suit see insurance below 
glaxosmithkline glaxo v

against impax in the united states district court for the northern district of california on november  alleging infringement of us patent no 
 covering wellbutrin sr zyban 
on november   impax filed its answer to the complaint which included defenses to the infringement claim  and counterclaimed for patent invalidity 
glaxo has filed suit against andrx  watson  eon only with regard to wellbutrin sr and excel for similar anda filings 
all parties attended a status conference in july to discuss the need for a markman claim construction hearing 
impax was successful in convincing the court that a markman hearing was unnecessary because there was no literal infringement and no dispute regarding the claim construction proffered by glaxo 
instead  impax advocated that our summary judgment motion  based upon prosecution history estoppel grounds  be calendared for oral argument 
the parties completed the briefing on this issue and oral argument was held on november  at the request of the court  in july  both sides submitted briefs on the impact of the recent supreme court decision in festo v 
shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushi co  et al 
to the pending motion for summary judgment 
an additional motion for summary judgment was brought in early august  requesting judge patel apply the district court for the eastern district of virginia s decision limiting the scope of the patent in the glaxo v 
excel case to impax s anda formulation 
on august   judge patel granted impax s motions for summary judgment  stating that prosecution estoppel bars infringement by equivalents throughout the patent 
glaxo has appealed judge patel s decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit and that appeal was fully briefed on january  oral argument will be scheduled for sometime in the first quarter  after which impax expects a decision on the appeal

aventis pharmaceuticals inc  et al 
v 
impax the fexofenadine cases on march   aventis pharmaceuticals inc  merrell pharmaceuticals inc  and carderm capital lp collectively aventis sued impax in the united states district court for the district of new jersey civil action no 
cv alleging that impax s proposed fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride tablets  containing mg of fexofenadine and mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride  infringe united states patent nos 
     and  on november   aventis filed an amended complaint  which added an allegation that impax s fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride mg mg extended release tablet product infringes united states patent no 
 aventis seeks an injunction preventing impax from marketing its fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride mg mg extended release tablet product until the patents in suit have expired  and an award of damages for any commercial manufacture  use  or sale of impax s fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride mg mg extended release tablet product  together with costs and attorneys fees 
on march   aventis filed a virtually identical complaint against impax in the united states district court for the district of delaware civil action no 

the delaware complaint was filed in case aventis could not obtain personal jurisdiction over impax in new jersey 
on may   impax moved to dismiss the new jersey action for lack of personal jurisdiction 
on december   impax s motion to dismiss the action in new jersey was denied 
on december   a stipulation dismissing the delaware action without prejudice was filed 
because of the pending procedural motions  discovery is in its early stages 
impax believes  however  that it has strong defenses to the claims made by aventis based on noninfringement and invalidity 
the court has scheduled trial for september aventis has also filed a suit against barr laboratories  inc in new jersey asserting the same patents against barr s proposed fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride mg mg extended release tablet product 
the impax case will be coordinated with the barr case for discovery purposes  but it has not yet been decided whether the two will be consolidated for trial 
purdue pharma lp et al 
v impax the oxycodone cases on april   purdue pharma and related companies filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york alleging that impax s submission of anda no 
for mg oxycontin tablets infringes three patents owned by purdue 
the purdue patents are us  us  and us  all directed to controlled release opiod formulations 
on september   purdue filed a second infringement complaint regarding impax s mg oxycontin generic product 
on october   purdue filed a third infringement complaint regarding impax s mg and mg oxycontin generic products 
purdue is seeking  among other things  a court order preventing impax from manufacturing  using or selling any drug product that infringes the subject purdue patents 
impax is currently disputing the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york in which purdue has brought this matter by pursuing a motion to dismiss purdue s action 
as of march   the court has not ruled on impax s pending motion 
discovery will begin once this jurisdictional question has been resolved 
purdue previously has sued boehringer ingelheim roxane  endo and teva on the same patents 
it is possible that one or more of these other defendants will resolve the invalidity issues surrounding the purdue patents prior to impax going to trial 
impax v 
aventis pharmaceuticals  inc the riluzole case in june  impax filed suit against aventis pharmaceuticals  inc in the united states district court in wilmington  delaware  seeking a declaration that the filing of an abbreviated new drug application to engage in a commercial manufacture and or sale of riluzole mg tablets for treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral scleroses als does not infringe claims of aventis us patent no 
 the patent and a declaration that this patent is invalid 
in response to impax s complaint  aventis filed counterclaims for direct infringement and inducement of infringement of the patent 
in december  the district court granted aventis motion for preliminary injunction and enjoined impax from infringing  contributory infringing  or inducing any other person to infringe claims  or of the patent by selling  offering for sale  distributing  marketing or exporting from the united states any pharmaceutical product or compound containing riluzole or salt thereof for the treatment of als 
the parties are currently engaged in the discovery phase of the action 
impax is pursuing its assertions that claims of the patent are invalid in view of prior art and are unenforceable in view of inequitable conduct committed during the prosecution of the patent before the us patent trademark office 
until discovery is completed  no estimate can be given of impax s likelihood of success on its invalidity and unenforceability defenses 
if impax is not ultimately successful in proving invalidity or unenforceability  there is a substantial likelihood that the court will enter a permanent injunction enjoining impax from marketing riluzole mg tablets for the treatment of als in the united states until the expiration of the patent june  
if impax is ultimately successful in proving either defense  the preliminary injunction would be set aside and impax would be permitted to market its riluzole mg tablet product for the treatment of als in the united states 
abbott laboratories v 
impax the fenofibrate tablets cases on january   abbott laboratories filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court in delaware alleging patent infringement related to impax s filing of an anda for a generic version of abbott s tricor fenofibrate mg tablets 
impax believes that it has strong defenses to the claims made by abbott based on non infringement 
abbott has filed the same lawsuits against novapharm  teva and pharmaceutical resources 
merck co  inc v 
impax the carbidopa and levodopa case on february   merck co  inc filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court in delaware alleging patent infringement related to impax s filing of an anda for a generic version of sinemet cr tablets 
impax believes that it has strong defenses to the claims made by merck based on non infringement 
other than the patent litigations described above  we are not aware of any other material pending or threatened legal actions  private or governmental  against us 
however  as we file additional applications with fda that contain paragraph iv certifications  it is likely we will become involved in additional litigation related to those filings 
insurance as part of our patent litigation strategy  we have obtained two policies covering up to million of patent infringement liability insurance from american international specialty line company aislic  an affiliate of aig international 
this litigation insurance covers us against the costs associated with patent infringement claims made against us relating to seven of the andas we filed under paragraph iv of the hatch waxman amendments 
at present  we believe this insurance coverage is sufficient for our legal defense costs related to these seven andas 
correspondence received from aislic indicated that  as of january   one of the policies had approximately  remaining on the limit of liability and the second of the policies had approximately  remaining on the limit of liability 
in addition  as per the agreement with teva  for the six products already filed at the time of the agreement  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs in excess of the million to be paid by aislic 
for the three products filed since the agreement was signed  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs  and for the remaining three products  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs 
however  we do not believe that this type of litigation insurance will be available to us on acceptable terms for our other current or future andas 
in those cases  our policy is to record such expenses as incurred 
product liability claims by customers constitute a risk to all pharmaceutical manufacturers 
we carry million of product liability insurance for our own manufactured products 
this insurance may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims to which we may become subject

as a reverse acquisition  the historical operating results prior to the merger are those of impax pharmaceuticals and only include global s operating results after the merger 
the following unaudited pro forma information on results of operations assumes the companies had combined on january  pro forma year ended december  operating revenue  research and development  operating loss  net loss  net loss per share basic and diluted 
excludes non recurring charges related to acquisition of  or per share 
we were considered a development stage company until december  includes acquired in process research and development of  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to returns  rebates and chargebacks  inventory reserves  impaired assets and goodwill 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
the policies require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition are as follows during the year  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab issued by the securities and exchange commission sec in december we recognize revenue from the sale of products when the shipment of products is received and accepted by the customer 
provisions for estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded 
if historical data used to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future activity  our net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could be impacted 
the application of the sab guidance to the company s previous revenue recognition policy requires us to defer revenue recognition from the sale of product until the shipment of product is received and accepted by the customer  rather than recognizing revenue only upon shipment 
the change in accounting policy resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment at january   of  and also resulted in an increase in revenue and gross margin of  and  respectively  for the twelve month period ended december  revenue from strategic alliances includes up front payments and milestone payments 
up front payments are generally deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are generally recognized when the requirements set forth in the related agreement are met and such recognition represents a separate earnings process 
in evaluating whether a separate earnings process has been met  the company considers the following criteria a level of effort involved in achieving the milestone  b reasonableness of the milestone payment in relation to the effort expended in achieving the milestone  c the amount of time that has passed from the up front payment  if any  to the milestone payment and between various milestones  d the amount of the payment in relation to the risk involved in achieving the milestone  and e relationship between the amount of the up front payment and the first milestone payment 
our critical accounting policy related to returns reserve is as follows the sales return reserve is calculated using historical lag period that is  the time between when the product is sold and when it is ultimately returned as determined from the company s system generated lag period report and return rates  adjusted by estimates of the future return rates based on various assumptions which may include changes to internal policies and procedures  changes in business practices and commercial terms with customers  competitive position of each product  amount of inventory in the pipeline  the introduction of new products  and changes to ndc numbers 
our returned goods policy requires prior authorization for the return  with corresponding credits being issued at the original invoice prices  less amounts previously granted to the customer for rebates and chargebacks 
products eligible for return must be expired and returned within one year following the expiration date of the product 
prior to  we required returns of products within six months of expiration date 
because of the lengths of the lag period and volatility that may occur from quarter to quarter  we are currently using a rolling month calculation to estimate our product return rate 
in addition to the rolling month calculation  we review the level of pipeline inventory at major wholesalers to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of future returns 
although the pipeline inventory information may not always be accurate or timely  it represents another data point in estimating the sales returns reserve 
if we believe that a wholesaler may have too much inventory on hand  a discussion with the wholesaler takes place and an action plan is developed to reduce inventory levels related to a particular product including  but not limited to  suspending new orders and redirecting the inventory to other distribution centers 
further  in  we have developed an order flagging mechanism based on historical purchases by individual customers 
this new process will allow the company to evaluate any customer orders  which have quantities higher than historical purchases 
the company believes that its estimated returns reserves were adequate at each balance sheet date since they were formed based on the information that was known and available at the time of the form k filing  management s expectations  which were supported by the company s historical experience when similar events occurred in the past  and management s overall knowledge of and experience in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
in estimating its returns reserve  the company looks to returns after the balance sheet date but prior to filing its financial statements to ensure that any unusual trends are considered 
at december  and  our returns reserve was million and million  respectively 
our critical accounting policy related to rebates and chargebacks is as follows the sales rebates are calculated at the point of sale  based on pre existing written customer agreements by product  and accrued on a monthly basis 
typically  these rebates are for a fixed percentage  as agreed to by the company and the customer in writing  multiplied by the dollar volume purchased 
the vast majority of chargebacks are also calculated at the point of sale as the difference between the list price and contract price by product with the wholesalers and accrued on a monthly basis 
therefore  for these chargebacks  the amount is fixed and determinable at the point of sale 
additionally  a relatively small percentage of chargebacks are estimated at the point of sale to the wholesaler as the difference between the wholesalers contract price and the company s contract price with retail pharmacies or buying groups 
at december  and  our reserves for rebates were million and million  respectively  and at december  and  our reserves for chargebacks were million and million  respectively 
while the determination of reserves for sales rebates and chargebacks does not require significant judgments or estimates  the company believes it is important for the users of its financial statements to understand the key components  which reduce gross sales to net sales 
our critical accounting policy related to inventory is as follows inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard cost method  which assumes a first in  first out fifo flow of goods 
standard costs are revised annually  and significant variances between actual costs and standard arising are apportioned to inventory and cost of goods sold based upon inventory turnover 
the company considers product costs as inventory once the company receives fda approval to market the related products 
costs include materials  labor  quality control  and production overhead 
inventory is adjusted for short dated  unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december  and  our inventory reserve was  and  respectively 
our critical accounting policy related to shelf stock reserve is as follows a reserve is estimated at the point of sale for certain products for which it is probable that shelf stock credits to customers for inventory remaining on their shelves following a decrease in the market price of these products will be granted 
when estimating this reserve  we consider the competitive products  the estimated decline in market prices  and the amount of inventory in the pipeline 
at december  and  the shelf stock reserve was  and  respectively 
our critical accounting policy related to impaired assets is as follows the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
as the company s assumptions related to assets to be held and used are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in recognition of a charge or benefit to earnings 
our critical accounting policy related to goodwill is as follows prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 effective january  under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performs the annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level  which the company has determined to be consistent with its business segment  that is  the entire company 
effective january   we evaluated the recoverability and measured the possible impairment of our goodwill under sfas the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company  as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the generic pharmaceutical industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  we compare our estimate of fair value for the company to the book value of our consolidated net assets 
if the book value of our net assets is greater than our estimate of fair value  we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the company and its goodwill 
if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred  we would consult with one or more valuation specialists in estimating the impact on our estimate of fair value 
we believe the estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
at december  and  the company had recorded goodwill of approximately million 
general impax laboratories  inc was formed through a business combination on december   between impax pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held drug delivery company  and global pharmaceutical corporation  a generic pharmaceutical company 
impax pharmaceuticals  inc merged with and into global  with impax pharmaceuticals  inc stockholders receiving shares of global common stock for each share of impax pharmaceuticals  inc at the conclusion of the merger  impax pharmaceuticals  inc stockholders held over of the combined company 
for accounting purposes  the merger has been treated as a recapitalization of impax pharmaceuticals  inc  with impax pharmaceuticals  inc deemed the acquirer of global in a reverse acquisition 
as a reverse acquisition  our historical operating results prior to the merger are those of impax pharmaceuticals  inc and only include the operating results of global after the merger

final approval is contingent upon the earlier of the resolution of patent infringement litigation brought by abbott against impax  or the expiration of the month stay process under the hatch waxman amendments  and the expiration of any generic marketing exclusivity 
final approval is also dependent upon the fda s evaluation of any new information it receives subsequent to this tentative approval 
in february  the fda accepted our filing of an anda for a generic version of allegra d fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride mg mg extended release tablets impax s eighth paragraph iv filing

because of the nature of returns discontinued products or short dated products  we concluded the returned inventory had no value to the company and the products were destroyed 
gross margin the gross margin for the year ended december  was  as compared to a negative gross margin of  for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due to higher net sales and better product mix from the newly introduced products

during  we met this condition  resulting in the reversal of the accrued interest in the fourth quarter of and no future interest will accrue 
net loss the net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   which included goodwill amortization of  the decrease in the net loss of  was primarily due to the absence of amortization of goodwill due to the adoption of sfas effective january  and increased sales that were partially offset by increases in research and development  and operating expenses 
the results included a benefit from the reversal of the interest expense on the refundable deposit from teva of approximately  year ended december  compared to year ended december  overview the net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss was primarily due to lower sales and higher infrastructure costs related to the new manufacturing facility in hayward  california and expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities 
revenues the net sales for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in the lower sales were primarily due to the fact that the company discontinued certain products during the discontinued products 
these discontinued products accounted for gross sales of approximately  in additionally  the company experienced higher sales returns expense of approximately  in these decreases were partially offset by the introduction of new products in that had gross sales of approximately  the following table summarizes the activity in net sales for the year ended december  and in s active products   discontinued products  sab adjustment gross sales   less actual returns  increase in reserve for product returns  rebates  chargebacks and other credits   net sales   due to the consolidation of all manufacturing activities in hayward  california  a number of products  which represented approximately of our sales for the period  were discontinued in august and a change in national drug code ndc numbers for one of the lipram products 
regarding the old ndc lipram  the company determined that  for customer relations purposes as well as for competitive reasons  it accepted the return of the old ndc lipram 
see note to the financial statements for a discussion of this adjustment 
the actual returns of  included approximately  of discontinued products 
the increase of  in returns reserve was the result of our review and analysis of the historical return rates through and the lag period  adjusted by estimates of the future return rates 
the increase in rebates  chargebacks  and other credits was primarily due to sales volume increase and increased competition 
cost of sales the cost of sales for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period in included in the cost of sales are startup costs of the new manufacturing facility in hayward  california  and unabsorbed fixed costs due to excess plant capacity in philadelphia  pennsylvania

general and administrative expenses the general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in the decrease in general and administrative expenses as compared to was primarily due to lower intangibles amortization caused by the impairment write off in the third quarter of  and lower patent infringement litigation insurance and related costs  partially offset by higher personnel expenses and professional fees 
the amortization of intangibles and goodwill for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period in other operating income the other operating income was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to lower license fees earned in restructuring charges and non recurring items we had no restructuring charges and non recurring items for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we incurred charges of  representing a one time write off for impairment of  of intangibles   of inventory  and  of equipment due to ceasing manufacturing in the philadelphia facility and rationalizing the product lines 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to increases in cash equivalents and short term investments from funds received in connection with the teva refundable deposit and equity investments  and the june private placement of equity  partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to the  interest accrued in on the refundable deposit from teva 
the interest expense is net of  in capitalized interest related to the renovation of the san antonio street  hayward  california building 
net loss the net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the same period in the increase in net loss was primarily due to lower net sales and higher infrastructure costs related to the new manufacturing facility in hayward  california and the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities 
our net loss was favorably impacted by the absence of restructuring charges and non recurring items  and lower intangibles amortization in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  at december  the net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately  consisting of proceeds of  from the sale of common stock to teva  proceeds of  from issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and warrants  net borrowing of  from congress financial less the transfer of  to a restricted cash account that serves as collateral for the million revolving credit facility and term loan agreement signed with congress financial in october during the year ended december   the sale and maturities of short term investments of  funded capital expenditures of approximately  related to the completion of the manufacturing facility in hayward  california and the purchases of machinery and equipment required for expansion of our operating capacity 
the  in net cash provided by investing activities and the  provided by financing activities funded our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  the increase in the accounts receivable and inventory was substantially offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable at december  were  or  higher than those at december   with the increase primarily attributable to increased product sales 
most of the company s major customers have payment terms between days and days 
as such  the accounts receivable balance normally represents the previous two to three months of net sales 
on october   we signed a three year  million loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation  comprised of a revolving loan of up to  and a term loan of up to  the revolving loan is collateralized by eligible accounts receivable and inventory  subject to sublimits and other terms  and the term loan is collateralized by machinery and equipment  with a month amortization 
in addition  a million restricted cash account was established as collateral for this credit facility to be reduced based on meeting certain profitability targets 
the interest rates for the revolving loans range from prime rate plus to  or eurodollar rate plus to  at our option  based on excess availability 
the term loan has an interest rate of prime rate plus  or eurodollar rate plus  at our option 
as of december   we borrowed approximately  against the revolving credit line and  against the term loan 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement have a number of quarterly covenants primarily covering minimum tangible net worth  and either ebitda or excess availability and annual capital expenditures limit of million 
at december   all the bank loan covenants were met 
the million refundable deposit from teva  less any forgiven amounts upon impax s attainment of certain milestone  if any  is due and payable on january   in cash or equity at our discretion 
as previously indicated in part i  item  as of february   we believe that approximately million of the million may be forgiven prior to january   although there is no assurance that any of the million may be ultimately forgiven 
these milestone events  if achieved  will represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
if we repay the loan in stock  such payment will result in dilution 
if we repay all our portion of the loan in cash  we may seek additional sources of liquidity to fund such payment  as discussed below 
our capital expenditures planned for include  primarily  purchases of machinery and equipment  and range between and million as compared to approximately  spent in we have no interest rate or derivative hedging contracts and material foreign exchange or commodity price risks 
we are also not party to any off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly research and development  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we  therefore  anticipate that such operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
although our existing cash and cash equivalents are expected to decline during  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  together with our million term loan and revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our operational plan for the next twelve months 
we may  however  seek additional financing through strategic alliances and or equity markets to repay the teva deposit  if required  and to fund our research and development plans  and potential revenues shortfall due to delays in new products introduction 
however  we may be unable to obtain such financing 
to date  we funded our research and development and other operating activities through equity and debt financings  and strategic alliances 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we plan to retain any earnings for the operation and expansion of our business 
our loan agreements and our strategic agreement with teva prohibit the payment of dividends without the other party s consent

the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
risk factors we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating losses and negative cash flow from operations  and our future profitability is uncertain 
we do not know whether or when our business will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow  and our ability to become profitable or obtain positive cash flow is uncertain 
we have generated minimal revenues to date and have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was  and we had outstanding indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of  including  due teva 
to remain operational  we must  among other things continue to obtain sufficient capital to fund our operations  obtain from the fda approval for our products  prevail in patent infringement litigation in which we are involved  successfully launch our new products  and comply with the many complex governmental regulations that deal with virtually every aspect of our business activities 
we may never become profitable or generate positive cash flow from operations 
we currently have a limited number of commercialized products and these products generate limited revenues and are expected to have declining revenues over their product lives 
we currently market twenty seven generic pharmaceuticals which represent dosage variations of twelve different pharmaceutical compounds 
our revenues from these products for the twelve months ended december  were million 
we do not anticipate further revenue growth from these products  rather  we anticipate that revenues from these products will decline over time 
as a result  our future prospects are dependent on our ability to successfully introduce new products 
as of december   we had nineteen andas pending at the fda for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals 
the fda and the regulatory authorities may not approve our products submitted to them  or our other products under development 
additionally  we may not successfully complete our development efforts 
even if the fda approves our products  we may not be able to market our products if we do not prevail in the patent infringement litigation in which we are involved 
our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to develop  receive fda approval for  and market new pharmaceutical products 
our efforts may not result in required fda approval of our new drug products 
we are required to obtain fda approval before marketing new drug products 
the fda approval requirements are costly and time consuming 
for drugs that contain the same active ingredient and are of the same route of administration  dosage form  strength and indication s as drugs already approved for use in the united states the reference or listed drugs  the fda ordinarily only requires bioavailability data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference drug  indicating that the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the previously approved reference drug 
our bioequivalence studies and other data may not result in fda approval to market our new drug products 
while we believe that the fda s abbreviated new drug application procedures will apply to our bioequivalent versions of controlled release drugs  these drugs may not be suitable for  or approved as part of  these abbreviated applications 
moreover  after the fda approves one of our products  we may have to withdraw it from the market if our manufacturing is not in accordance with fda standards or our own internal standards 
bioequivalent pharmaceuticals  commonly referred to as generics  are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of brand name drugs and are usually marketed under their established nonproprietary drug names rather than by a brand name 
controlled release drug delivery technologies generally provide more consistent and appropriate drug levels in the bloodstream than immediate release dosage forms and may improve drug efficacy and reduced side effects by releasing drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations in the body 
these technologies also allow for the development of patient friendly dosage forms that reduce the number of times a drug must be taken  thus improving patient compliance 
approvals for our new drug products may become more difficult to obtain if changes to fda approval requirements are instituted 
some abbreviated application procedures for bioequivalent controlled release drugs and other products are presently the subject of petitions filed by brand name drug manufacturers  which seek changes from the fda in the approval requirements for particular bioequivalent drugs 
we cannot predict at this time whether the fda will make any changes to its abbreviated application requirements as a result of these petitions  or the effect that any changes may have on us 
any changes in fda regulations or policies may make abbreviated application approvals more difficult and thus may materially harm our business and financial results 
we have no experience in conducting clinical trials or preparing a new drug application which may be required if a drug we develop does not qualify for the fda s abbreviated applications procedures 
in order to market a new drug that does not qualify for the fda s abbreviated application procedures  we may have to conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and submit a new drug application  or nda 
the process of completing clinical trials and preparing an nda may take several years and requires substantial resources 
we have never submitted an nda 
our studies and filings may not result in fda approval to market our new drug products and  if the fda grants approval  we cannot predict the timing of any approval 
we face significant delays in obtaining fda approval as a result of patent infringement litigation 
patent certification requirements for bioequivalent controlled release drugs and for some new drugs could also result in significant delays in obtaining fda approval if patent infringement litigation is initiated by the holder or holders of the brand name patents 
we apply our proprietary drug delivery technologies and formulation skills to develop bioequivalent versions of selected controlled release brand name pharmaceuticals 
specifically  we apply our proprietary processes and formulations to develop a product that will produce the brand product s physiological characteristics but not infringe upon the patents of the owner of the nda or other innovator 
in connection with this process  we conduct studies to establish that our product is bioequivalent to the brand product  and obtain legal advice that our products do not infringe the nda owner s or the innovator s patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable 
as required by the drug price competition and patent restoration act of  known as the hatch waxman amendments  we then assemble and submit an anda to the fda for review 
if we believe that our product does not infringe a patent associated with the brand product which has been listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluation book  commonly referred to as the orange book  or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable  we are required to make such a certification 
this is called a paragraph iv certification 
once the fda accepts our anda for filing  we must also send notice of a paragraph iv certification to the nda owner and patent holder 
the nda owner or patent holder may then initiate a legal challenge for patent infringement 
if they do so within days of their receipt of notice of our paragraph iv certification  that ensuing lawsuit will automatically prevent the fda from approving our anda until the earlier of months  expiration of the patent  or when the infringement case is decided in our favor 
brand name companies may obtain additional patents after an anda has been filed  but before final marketing approval has been granted  which may result in a new legal challenge and may require submission of a new paragraph iv certification and trigger a new notice and waiting period requirements 
thus  the developer of bioequivalent products may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of these products only to be subject to significant delays and the uncertain results of patent litigation before its products may be commercialized 
patent litigation has been instituted against us with respect to nine of our pending andas relating to our generic controlled release product candidates 
delays in obtaining fda approval of abbreviated applications and some new drug applications can also result from a marketing exclusivity period and or an extension of patent terms 
we are subject to substantial patent litigation that could delay or prevent our commercialization of products 
we have  and continue to face substantial patent infringement litigation with respect to our proposed products 
as of february   we had nineteen andas pending at the fda for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals 
to date  patent litigation has been filed against us in connection with twelve of the andas we have filed containing certifications relating to infringement  validity  or enforceability of patents 
in these andas  we have certified that we believe an unexpired patent that is listed with the fda and covers the brand name product will not be infringed and or is invalid or unenforceable 
patent litigation is both costly and time consuming 
if we are unable to prevail in these litigations or obtain any required licenses  we may be prevented from commercializing our products 
we anticipate that additional legal actions may be filed against us as we file additional andas 
patent litigation may also be brought against us in connection with nda products that we may pursue 
the outcome of patent litigation is difficult to predict 
prior to filing an anda or nda  we evaluate the probability of patent infringement litigation on a case by case basis 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed by the delays in marketing our products as a result of litigation  an unfavorable outcome in any litigation  or the expense of litigation  whether or not it is successful 
if our strategic alliance with teva fails to benefit us as expected  our business will be harmed 
in june  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with teva pharmaceuticals curacao nv  a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
teva for twelve controlled release generic products 
the agreement grants teva exclusive us marketing rights for six of our products 
the six products already filed at the time of the agreement were omeprazole mg  mg  and mg delayed released capsules generic of prilosec  bupropion hydrochloride mg and mg extended release tablets generic of wellbutrin sr  bupropion hydrochloride mg extended release tablets generic of zyban  loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets generic of claritin d hour and loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate mg mg hour extended release tablets generic of claritin d hour and loratadine mg orally disintegrating tablets generic of claritin reditabs 
of the six products to be developed at the time the agreement was signed  three have since been filed with the fda 
teva elected to commercialize a competing product to one of the three products filed since june  which it has developed internally 
pursuant to the agreement  we have elected to participate in the development and commercialization of teva s competing product and share in the gross margin of such product 
we will depend on our strategic alliance with teva to achieve market penetration and revenue generation for the products covered by the agreement 
we entered into the agreement with teva on the basis of certain expectations of the level of sales of the products that teva will achieve 
if we fail to maintain our strategic alliance with teva  or if our strategic alliance with teva fails to benefit us as expected  our revenues will not meet our expectations and our business will be harmed 
our stockholders may be adversely affected by strategic alliances or licensing arrangements we make with other companies 
we have entered into strategic alliances or license agreements with respect to certain of our products with teva  wyeth  novartis  and schering plough 
in the future  we may enter into strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with respect to other products with these or other companies 
these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to not be favorable to us  either of which could reduce the market value of our common stock 
we face intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry from both brand name and generic manufacturers  and wholesalers that could severely limit our growth 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  and other resources than us 
we are subject to competition from numerous other entities that currently operate in the pharmaceutical industry  including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled release drug delivery technologies and products  and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake in house development of these products 
our generic products may be subject to competition from  among other products  competing generic products marketed by the patent holder

in order to obtain market share for our generic products  our products will need to be successfully marketed to pharmaceutical wholesalers  chain drug stores which warehouse products  mass merchandisers  mail order pharmacies and others 
these entities often purchase generic products from a limited number of suppliers  which they then sell to end users 
among the factors considered by these entities in purchasing a generic product are price  on time delivery  a good record with the fda  and relationship 
in order to obtain market share for our brand name products  we will be dependent on physicians prescribing our products to their patients 
among the factors considered by physicians in prescribing a brand name product is the quality and effectiveness of the product 
we have only limited experience in marketing our generic products and have no experience in marketing brand name products 
we  or our strategic partners  may not be able to successfully market our products 
we face risks related to goodwill and intangibles 
at december   our goodwill and intangibles were approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we may never realize the value of our goodwill and intangibles 
we will continue to evaluate  on a regular basis  whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all  or a portion  of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable  in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired based on our assessment performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
any such future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of carrying value of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our limited capital may make it difficult for us to repay indebtedness  or require us to modify our business operations and plans by spending less money on research and development programs  developing fewer products  and filing fewer drug applications with the fda 
our cash used in operations has exceeded cash generated from operations in each period since our inception 
we anticipate continuing to incur expenses substantially in excess of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately  of which  bears interest at rates ranging from to annually 
for the year ended december   we paid interest on our indebtedness of approximately  additionally  as of december   we had an accumulated stockholders deficit of approximately  we may not be able to maintain adequate capital at any given time  or from time to time in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in restricted cash that serves as collateral for the million revolving credit facility and loan agreement with congress financial 
although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months of operations at our planned expenditure levels  these funds may not be sufficient 
the exact amount and timing of future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including continued progress with our research and development programs  expansion of these programs  the approval and launch of new products  as well as the amount of revenues generated by our existing products 
we may not be successful in obtaining additional capital in amounts sufficient to fund our operations 
additional financing also may not be available to us on terms favorable to us  our stockholders  or at all 
in the event that adequate funds are not available  our business operations and plans may need to be modified 
the lack of additional capital could result in less money being spent on research and development programs  fewer products being developed and at a slower pace  and fewer drug applications being filed with the fda 
generic drug makers are often most profitable when they are the first producer of a generic drug  and we do not know if we will be the first producer of any generic drug product 
in august  the fda proposed to amend its regulations relating to day marketing exclusivity for which certain bioequivalent drugs may qualify 
in its proposal  the fda explained that  to qualify for exclusivity  a pharmaceutical company must be the first generic applicant to file an anda with the fda in a substantially complete form  rather than the first company to successfully challenge a patent 
we believe we were first to file with the fda on only one anda 
we cannot predict whether or what changes the fda may make to its regulations 
in march  the fda issued new guidelines regarding the timing of approval of andas following a court decision in patent infringement actions and the start of the day marketing exclusivity period provided for in the hatch waxman amendments applicable to generic pharmaceuticals 
these guidelines could result in us not being able to utilize all or any portion of the day marketing exclusivity period on anda products we were first to file on  depending on the timing and outcome of court decisions in patent litigation 
we are unable to predict what impact  if any  the fda s new guidelines may have on our business or financial condition 
the first generic drug manufacturers receiving fda approval for generic equivalents of related brand name products have often captured greater market share from the brand name product than later arriving manufacturers 
the development of a new generic drug product  including its formulation  testing  and fda approval  generally takes approximately three or more years 
consequently  we may select drugs for development several years in advance of their anticipated entry to market and cannot know what the market or level of competition will be for that particular product if and when we begin selling the product 
in addition  by introducing generic versions of their own brand name products prior to the expiration of the patents for those drugs  brand name drug companies have attempted to prevent generic drug manufacturers from producing or capturing market share for certain products 
brand name companies have also attempted to prevent competing generic drug products from being treated as equivalent to their brand name products 
we expect efforts of this type to continue 
we face uncertainties related to clinical trials that could result in delays in product development and commercialization 
prior to seeking fda approval for the commercial sale of brand name controlled release formulations under development  we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use 
we have limited experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials 
a number of difficulties are associated with clinical trials 
the results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing 
clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and  as a result  during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested but which  nevertheless  affect the clinical trial results 
moreover  our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain fda approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in pre clinical studies 
these failures have often resulted in decreases in the stock prices of these companies 
if any of our products under development are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  our business and financial results could be materially harmed 
our assumptions may not bear out as we expect 
our expectations regarding the success of our products and our business are based on assumptions that may not bear out as we expect 
in our press releases and other public documents  we have forecasted the accomplishment of objectives material to our success  such as anticipated filings with the fda and anticipated receipt of fda approvals 
for example  we have assumed that we would file with the fda at least six andas per year 
the actual timing and results of these events can vary dramatically due to factors such as the uncertainties inherent in the drug development and regulatory approval process  and delays in achieving manufacturing capacity and marketing infrastructure sufficient to commercialize our products 
we may not make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as forecasted  or we may not be able to adhere to our current schedule for product launches 
the time necessary to develop generic drugs may adversely affect if and when  and the rate at which  we receive a return on our capital 
we begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand name drug equivalent 
the development process  including drug formulation  testing  and fda review and approval  often takes three or more years 
this process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near term return 
also  because of the significant time necessary to develop a product  the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product 
if this were to occur  our potential return on our investment in developing the product  if approved for marketing by the fda  would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product 
it is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the fda to switch the brand name drug from the prescription market to the over the counter market 
if this were to occur  we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an over the counter drug  in which case product revenues could be significantly less than we anticipated 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated  and could fluctuate significantly in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year 
variations may result from  among other factors the timing of fda approvals we receive  the timing of process validation for particular generic drug products  the timing of product launches  the introduction of new products by others that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive  the outcome of our patent infringement litigations  and the addition or loss of customers  including strategic partners 
our results of operations will also depend on our ability to maintain selling prices and gross profit margins 
as competition from other manufacturers intensifies  selling prices and gross profit margins often decline  which has been our experience with our existing products 
our future operating results may also be affected by a variety of additional factors  including the results of future patent challenges and the market acceptance of our new products 
restrictive fda regulations govern the manufacturing and distribution of our products 
in addition to requiring fda approval prior to marketing any of our products  we are subject to fda regulations regarding the development  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of prescription drugs 
in addition  the fda requires that certain records be kept and reports be made  mandates registration of drug manufacturers and listing of their products  and has the authority to inspect manufacturing facilities for compliance with their current good manufacturing practices 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure to comply with manufacturing and other requirements 
other requirements exist for controlled drugs  such as narcotics  which are regulated by the us drug enforcement administration dea 
further  the fda has the authority to withdraw approvals of previously approved drugs for cause  to request recalls of products  to bar companies and individuals from future drug application submissions and  through action in court  to seize products  institute criminal prosecution  or close manufacturing plants in response to violations 
the dea has similar authority and may also pursue monetary penalties 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed by these requirements or fda or dea actions 
we will need an effective sales organization to market and sell our future brand products and our failure to build or maintain an effective sales organization may harm our business 
we do not currently market products under our own brand and we cannot assure you that we ever will do so 
currently  we do not have an active sales division to market and sell any brand name products that we may develop or acquire 
we may not be able to recruit qualified sales personnel to market our brand name products prior to the time those products are available for commercial launch 
our inability to enter into satisfactory sales and marketing arrangements in the future may materially harm our business and financial results 
we may have to rely on collaborative partners to market our branded products 
these partners may not have our same interests in marketing the products and may fail to effectively market the products  and we may lose control over the sales of these products 
decreases in health care reimbursements could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues 
our ability to maintain revenues for our products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of pharmaceuticals will be available from government health administration agencies  private health insurers  and other organizations 
in addition  third party payors are attempting to control costs by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products  including pharmaceuticals  which may adversely affect the pricing of our products 
moreover  health care reform has been  and is expected to continue to be  an area of national and state focus  which could result in the adoption of measures that could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the amount of reimbursement available from third party payors 
we cannot assure you that health care providers  patients  or third party payors will accept and pay for our pharmaceuticals 
in addition  there is no guarantee that health care reimbursement laws or policies will not materially harm our ability to sell our products profitably or prevent us from realizing an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
we depend on our patents and trade secrets and our future success is dependent on our ability to protect these secrets and not infringe on the rights of others 
we believe that patent and trade secret protection is important to our business and that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection  and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we have been issued four us patents and various foreign patent applications relating to our drug delivery technologies 
our us patents are for our concentric multiple particulate delivery system  our timed multiple action delivery system  particle dispersion system  and our pharmaceutical stabilization system 
we expect to apply for additional us and foreign patents in the future 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
in addition  the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that our products do not infringe on the patents of others 
we cannot assure you that our patents  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents  any of our future processes or products will be patentable  any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions  our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or we will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own patent rights against infringement by third parties 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge that we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees  consultants  licensees and pharmaceutical companies 
if these agreements are breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known by our competitors 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed if we fail to avoid infringement of the patent or proprietary rights of others or to protect our patent rights 
we have exposure to patent infringement litigation as a result of our product development efforts  which could adversely affect our product introduction efforts and be costly 
the patent position of pharmaceutical firms involves many complex legal and technical issues and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
there is no clear policy establishing the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under these patents 
during the past several years  there has been an increasing tendency for the innovator of the original patented product to bring patent litigation against a generic drug company 
this litigation is often initiated as an attempt to delay the entry of the generic drug product and reduce its market penetration 
as of december   we had million of patent infringement liability insurance from aislic covering us against the costs associated with patent infringement claims made against us relating to seven andas we filed under paragraph iv of the hatch waxman amendments 
correspondence received from aislic indicated that  as of january   one of the policies had approximately  remaining on the limit of liability and the second of the policies had approximately  remaining on the limit of liability 
at present  we believe this remaining insurance coverage is sufficient for our defense costs related to these seven andas 
in addition  as for the agreement with teva for the six products already filed at the time of the agreement  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs in excess of the million we expect to be paid by aislic 
for the three products filed since the agreement was signed  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs  and for the remaining three products  teva will pay of the attorneys fees and costs 
this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any liability resulting from alleged or proven patent infringement 
additionally  we do not believe that this type of litigation insurance will be available to us on acceptable terms for our other current or future andas 
in those cases  our policy is to record such expenses as incurred 
we may be subject to product liability litigation and any claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon us 
the design  development and manufacture of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we currently have product liability insurance that covers us for liability of up to million 
this insurance may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims to which we may become subject 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain  may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
any claims brought against us  whether fully covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect upon us 
we are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials  and any delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products 
the fda requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products 
if raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier  fda approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved 
in addition  some materials used in our products are currently available from only one  or a limited number of suppliers 
approximately of our net sales were attributable to one product family  which is supplied by a sole source supplier  eurand america  inc  under an exclusive licensing agreement that expires in generally  we would need up to one year to find and qualify a new sole source supplier 
if we receive less than one year s notice from a sole source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials  it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved 
further  a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources 
foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad  including greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems  the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies  interim price volatility based on labor unrest  materials or equipment shortages  or fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights 
the delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products 
this can materially adversely affect our business and operations 
we depend on key officers and qualified scientific and technical employees  and our limited resources may make it more difficult to attract and retain these personnel 
as a small company with approximately employees as of february   the success of our present and future operations will depend to a great extent on the collective experience  abilities  and continued service of charles hsiao  our chairman and co chief executive officer  barry r 
edwards  our co chief executive officer  larry hsu  our president  michael wokasch our chief operating officer  and certain of our other executive officers 
we do not have any employment agreements with any of our executive officers  other than dr 
hsiao  mr 
edwards  and dr 
hsu 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of our executives 
if we lose the services of any of these executive officers  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are also highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key scientific and technical personnel would be significantly detrimental to our product development programs 
our small size and limited financial and other resources may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and qualified scientific and technical personnel 
we have limited manufacturing capacity requiring us to build additional capacity for products in our pipeline 
our manufacturing facilities must comply with stringent fda and other regulatory requirements 
we currently have four facilities the hayward huntwood avenue  california   square foot facility which serves as our corporate headquarters and our primary development center  the hayward san antonio street  california   square foot facility which serves as our primary manufacturing center and a  square foot administrative office and warehouse facility in hayward  california and the philadelphia  pennsylvania   square foot facility which serves as our center for sales and marketing  packaging  warehousing and distribution 
we recently completed construction of our hayward san antonio street  california manufacturing center 
this new manufacturing facility will need to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices and inspected 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and we cannot assure you that the facilities will continue to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant delays in the development  approval and distribution of our planned products  and may require us to incur significant additional expense to comply with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements 
the dea also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with security  recordkeeping  and other requirements that govern controlled substances 
we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with dea requirements in the future 
our compliance with environmental  safety  and health laws may necessitate substantial expenditures in the future  the capital for which may not be available to us 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to make in order to comply with the federal  state and local environmental  safety and health laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations and facilities 
we must comply with environmental laws that govern  among other things  airborne emissions  waste water discharges  workplace safety  and solid and hazardous waste disposal 
we are also subject to potential liability for the remediation of contamination associated with both present and past hazardous waste generation  handling and disposal activities 
we are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by environmental  safety and health regulatory agencies 
environmental laws have changed in recent years and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and face larger capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws 
our limited capital makes it uncertain whether we will be able to pay for larger than expected capital expenditures 
also  future costs of compliance with new environmental  safety and health requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth of our operations 
we have increased our employee count from as of march  to as of february  the number of andas pending approval at the fda has increased from at june to at february this growth has required us to expand  upgrade and improve our administrative  operational and management systems  controls and resources 
we anticipate additional growth in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operations  development of our brand name products  and our marketing and sales efforts for the products we develop 
although we cannot assure you that we will  in fact  grow as we expect  if we fail to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing approach  our business and financial results will be materially harmed 
our stockholders may sustain future dilution in ownership as a result of the terms of some of our outstanding securities or future issuances of securities 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations and planned expansion 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders  including holders of shares purchased in this offering  will result 
at december   we had  shares outstanding of our series preferred stock that are convertible  at any time  at the option of their holders into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the shares of preferred stock also have anti dilution protections if we were to issue stock for a price below stated levels per share for the series preferred stock  which could make them convertible into additional shares of common stock 
in addition  the series preferred stock is subject to redemption  mandatorily on march   or at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of certain events 
in either case  we can elect to pay the redemption price of per share of series preferred stock by issuing shares of common stock at a discount of from the then current market price of the common stock 
in addition  we borrowed million from teva 
this refundable deposit will be forgiven if we achieve certain milestones relating to the development of certain products 
if we fail to achieve the milestones  the refundable deposit will become payable on january   in cash or  at our option  by the issuance of our common stock at a price equal to the average closing sale price for the common stock measured over the ten trading days ending two days prior to the date on which the common stock is acquired by teva 
however  if any of the shares we issue to teva as repayment of the loan will cause teva to own in excess of of our outstanding common stock  we will have to repay that portion of the loan in cash 
a substantial number of our shares are eligible for future sale and the sale of our shares into the market may depress our stock price 
our stock price may be depressed by future sales of our shares or perception that future sales may occur 
we had  shares outstanding as of december  of which approximately million shares were owned by our officers and directors or their affiliates and are considered restricted shares 
substantially all of these approximately million shares have been registered for sale under the securities act of and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold at any time without restriction 
the remaining shares of our outstanding common stock are freely tradable 
in addition  as of december  we had  shares of series preferred stock outstanding  convertible into an aggregate  shares of common stock  outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  and outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the common stock into which the outstanding  shares of series preferred stock are convertible has been registered for sale under the securities act of and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold at any time without restriction 
none of the shares underlying the warrants have yet been registered for sale under the securities act of  but substantially all of the warrants have registration rights entitling the holders to register the underlying shares under the securities act of in certain instances upon exercise of the warrants  which would allow those shares of common stock to be sold without restriction 
the shares underlying the stock options have been registered under the securities act of and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold upon exercise of the stock options without restriction 
in addition  on december  we had  shares of common stock available for issuance under employee benefit plans in addition to the  shares issuable upon exercise of the options referred to above 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing  or nature of future sales of common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of the common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  may lower the common stock s market price 
control of our company is concentrated among five stockholders who beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock and who can exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   our present directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates and related entities beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents 
certain of these stockholders have the right to obtain additional shares of our equity securities under certain circumstances 
they are entitled to preemptive rights  meaning that they are entitled to purchase additional shares of our equity securities when we sell shares of our equity in order to maintain their percentage ownership in our company  and are also entitled to anti dilution protection  meaning that they will receive additional shares of our common stock in the event that we issue shares of our common or preferred stock at a lower purchase price than the purchase price paid for shares issued to these stockholders 
they may also receive additional shares of our common stock if  pursuant to the mandatory or optional redemption provisions of our preferred stock  we redeem our preferred stock by electing to issue common stock in lieu of paying the cash redemption price 
these stockholders can exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also potentially delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
our stock price is likely to remain volatile 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of our common stock  like the stock price of many publicly traded specialty pharmaceutical companies  has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
for example  the closing sale price of our stock during the past year has ranged from a high of during the quarter ended march  to a low of during the quarter ended december  prices of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including investor perception of us  analyst recommendations  market conditions relating to specialty pharmaceutical companies  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  publicity regarding actual or potential development relating to products under development by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  delays in the development or approval of our product candidates  regulatory developments  period to period fluctuations in financial results of us and our competitors  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by shareholders  and economic and other external factors 
we have and may in the future issue additional preferred stock that could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders except that the rights  preferences  and privileges may not be more favorable to the stockholder than the series preferred stock  without the approval of holders of the series preferred stock 
preferred stockholders could adversely affect the rights and interests of holders of common stock by exercising voting  redemption  and conversion rights to the detriment of the holders of common stock  receiving preferences over the holders of common stock regarding assets or surplus funds in the event of our dissolution or liquidation  delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company  discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock  and otherwise adversely affecting the market price of the common stock 
we are not likely to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we plan to retain any earnings for the operation and expansion of our business 
our loan agreements and our strategic agreement with teva prohibit the payment of dividends without the other party s consent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities stated at cost which approximates market value 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of high credit quality securities  including us government securities  treasury bills  short term commercial paper  and highly rated money market funds 
one hundred percent of the company s portfolio matures in less than one year 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates the market value at december  the company s debt instruments at december   are subject to fixed interest rates and principal payments 
we believe that the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt and refundable deposit approximates its carrying value of approximately million at december  while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in the fair value of such debt on the company s financial statements will not be material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments and have no material foreign exchange or commodity price risks
