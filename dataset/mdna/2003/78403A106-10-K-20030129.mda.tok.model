item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k  and contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we originally incorporated as caldera systems  inc caldera systems  a utah corporation on august   and reincorporated as a delaware corporation on march  in march  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 
on may   we formed the company as a new holding company under the name of caldera international  inc  and acquired substantially all of the assets and operations of the server and professional services groups of tarantella inc  formerly known as the santa cruz operation  inc  pursuant to an agreement and plan of reorganization  dated august  and as subsequently amended the tarantella acquisition 
in connection with the formation of caldera international  inc  caldera systems was merged into caldera international 
former holders of shares and options to purchase shares of caldera systems received an equal number of shares and options to purchase shares in the company 
prior to the tarantella acquisition through which we acquired the openserver and unixware product lines  substantially all of our revenue was derived from sales of linux products and services 
currently  over percent of our total revenue is derived from unix products and services 
results of operations the tarantella acquisition significantly increased our revenue and operating expenses 
operating results for fiscal year are not directly comparable to fiscal years and because of the impact of the tarantella acquisition  which was effective may  we have reduced the number of our employees from at the time of the tarantella acquisition to as of october  during the six quarters subsequent to the tarantella acquisition  we have experienced a decline in our revenue primarily attributed to the worldwide economic slowdown  and as a result we have implemented cost reduction measures related to personnel and excess facilities and have reduced overall operating expenses 
we will continue to make cost reductions if our revenue continues to decline in order to seek profitability 
the following table summarizes our revenue and ongoing operating expenses for the past six quarters in thousands and unaudited quarters ended october  july  april  january  october  july  revenue       sales and marketing      research and development      general and administrative      total       pro forma fiscal years ended october  and as discussed above  the tarantella acquisition significantly increased our revenue and operating expenses 
because the revenue and continuing operating results for fiscal year are not directly comparable to fiscal years and as a result of the impact of the acquired operations  this separate pro forma analysis has been presented 
the following table presents our pro forma results of operations for fiscal year  assuming the tarantella acquisition had been completed at the beginning of the fiscal year in thousands and unaudited fiscal year caldera historical tarantella acquired operations pro forma adjustment pro forma total revenue    cost of revenue    gross margin    sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    other    total operating expenses     loss from operations     the pro forma adjustment above reflects the additional amortization of goodwill and intangible assets that would have been recorded had the acquisition been completed at the beginning of fiscal year revenue revenue was million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or percent 
the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to decreased sales of our unix products and related services due to a reduction in information technology spending throughout the world 
this economic slowdown has affected all of our geographic locations 
during fiscal year  percent of our revenue was generated from the sale of products and percent of our revenue was generated from services 
during fiscal year  percent of pro forma revenue was generated from the sale of products and percent of our pro forma revenue was generated from services 
the decrease in product revenue as a percentage of total revenue is attributed to decreasing product revenue while services revenue has remained relatively consistent over the same period 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue was million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year  a decrease of million or percent 
the decrease in cost of revenue during fiscal year was primarily attributable to decreased revenue

the increase in gross margin during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributed to reduced overhead costs and decreased royalties as well as reduced salaries and related costs for our support and professional services groups 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year  a decrease of million or percent 
sales and marketing expenses represented percent of total revenue for fiscal year  a decline from percent pro forma of total revenue for fiscal year the significant decrease in sales and marketing expenses is attributable to our restructuring activities that have resulted in reduced sales and marketing employees and the realignment of our sales and marketing function into geographic units  designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our sales operations 
other decreases in sales and marketing expenses have resulted from decreased travel and lower commissions and co operative advertising as a result of lower revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or percent 
research and development expenses represented percent of total revenue for fiscal year  a decrease from percent pro forma of total revenue for fiscal year the decrease in the dollar amount of research and development costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to decreased salaries and related costs due to fewer engineers and our efforts to consolidate development work on our linux and unix operating systems 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or percent 
general and administrative expenses represented percent of total revenue for fiscal year  a decrease from percent pro forma of total revenue for fiscal year the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to our recent restructuring activities that has resulted in reduced employees and related costs 
other 
other expenses consist primarily of the amortization of goodwill and intangibles  stock based compensation  restructuring charges  write downs of investments and the loss on disposition of long lived assets 
other expenses were million for fiscal year and million pro forma for fiscal year the decrease for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is primarily attributable to lower stock based compensation  decreased write downs of investments and losses on disposition of long lived assets and decreased amortization of goodwill and intangibles

the decrease in percentage of revenue from international customers from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily related to the economic slowdown and lack of information technology spending in emea 
the increase in revenue in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal year over fiscal year was attributable almost solely to the sale of unix products acquired in the tarantella acquisition 
products 
product revenue was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  representing an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year and an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in product revenue in fiscal year over fiscal year and fiscal year over fiscal year was attributable to the sale of openserver and unixware products acquired in the tarantella acquisition

the decrease in the cost of products revenue percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to a higher proportion of internet and electronic distribution orders associated with sales of unix and linux products  decreased manufacturing and overhead costs and decreased royalties to third party vendors 
for fiscal year  we expect the cost of products revenue as a percentage of products revenue to decrease slightly from fiscal year cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  representing an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year and an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the lower cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal year was attributable to reduced employee and related costs in our support services and professional services groups as well as the elimination of certain third party support contracts in an effort to increase the gross margin for these groups 
the higher cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal year and fiscal year was attributed to initial infrastructure and other costs of establishing our support and professional services offerings and organizations 
for fiscal year  we expect the cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue to decrease from fiscal year operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year  representing a decrease of million from fiscal year to fiscal year and an increase of million from fiscal year to fiscal year sales and marketing expenses represented percent of total revenue in fiscal year  percent of total revenue in fiscal year and percent of total revenue in fiscal year the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal year from fiscal year was attributable to a reduction in sales and marketing employees  reduced travel expenses  and less commissions and lower co operative advertising costs as a result of lower revenue 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal year over fiscal year was attributable to increased personnel and related costs as a result of the tarantella acquisition  increased spending related to corporate branding and costs incurred for product launches 
during fiscal year  we expanded our internal sales and marketing staff as well as increased its marketing programs and campaigns  advertising  channel and marketing development and trade show participation

restructuring charges 
during fiscal years and  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively 
the restructuring charges for fiscal year were comprised of termination payments made to employees in connection with reductions in headcount and the elimination of non essential facilities

  restructuring accrual during quarter ended july   restructuring accrual during quarter ended oct 
  total      amortization of goodwill and intangibles 
during fiscal year  we recorded million for the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives 
during fiscal year  we recorded million for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of the assets and operations from tarantella and the whatiflinux technology acquired from acrylis  inc the decrease in amortization expense was attributed to a write down of goodwill and intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that decreased the carrying value of these assets 
loss on disposition and write down of long term assets 
during fiscal year  we recorded a write down of long lived assets of million  which primarily related to restructurings that occurred during the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we determined that various assets related to the operations acquired from tarantella and acrylis were impaired and that the book value as of october  exceeded the current estimates of fair value 
as a result  we recorded a million write down of goodwill and intangible assets 
the fiscal year asset write down was the result of significant unanticipated decreases in actual and forecasted revenue of the acquired operations  a significant decline in market valuations and general economic conditions  particularly in the information technology sector  a weakening of certain partner relationships  the loss of certain key executives and other factors 
during fiscal year  we did not have any losses or write downs of long term assets 
write downs of investments 
management routinely assesses the company s investments for impairments and adjusts the carrying amounts to estimated realizable values when impairment has occurred 
during fiscal year  we determined that the current carrying value of one of our investments would not be realized and a write down was necessary 
we recorded a write down of million related to this investment 
during fiscal year  we determined that the current carrying value of certain of our investments would most likely not be realized and write downs were necessary 
we recorded write downs of million related to these investments 
the write downs in fiscal years and were due to changes in the general economic conditions and the impact on the operations of these companies as well as a decline in overall market valuations 
the company did not have any write downs of investments during fiscal year stock based compensation 
in connection with stock options and shares granted to employees  we recorded stock based compensation of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in stock based compensation from fiscal year to fiscal year and from fiscal year to fiscal year is a result of lower compensation amounts related to recent option grants and the amortization of previously recorded stock based compensation 
in process research and development 
in connection with the tarantella acquisition  we recorded a charge of million in fiscal year for the fair value of in process research and development 
the write off was necessary because the acquired in process research and development related to unixware and messaging server products had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
unixware delivered purpose built operating system configurations designed to power departmental databases  application servers  intranet servers  mail and messaging servers and other environments specifically tailored to run telecommunications and other embedded environments 
at the time of the acquisition  tarantella had invested approximately man months of effort or approximately million in the unixware product and anticipated man months of effort or approximately million to complete unixware unixware was approximately percent complete at the time of the acquisition 
the messaging server product was an entirely new product  which provides messaging functionality 
at the time of the acquisition  tarantella had invested man months of effort or approximately million in the messaging server product and anticipated man months of effort or million to complete messaging server 
messaging server was approximately percent complete at the time of the acquisition 
the company did not have any charges for in process research and development in fiscal year or fiscal year cost sharing arrangement with tarantella  inc during august and after entering into the agreement with tarantella to acquire the server software and professional services groups  we and tarantella agreed that we would reimburse tarantella for certain employee payroll and related costs 
the costs for which we agreed to reimburse tarantella were related to employees that tarantella had identified for termination in a company wide layoff in september we viewed these employees as a critical part of the success of the new combined company and tarantella agreed to retain the employees if we would reimburse tarantella for a portion of their payroll and related costs 
at the time we committed to reimburse tarantella for these employee costs  the ultimate amount was not determinable and both parties agreed that the amount would be determined prior to the completion of the acquisition 
during december  both parties agreed  pursuant to an amendment to the reorganization agreement  that we would reimburse tarantella million relating to services rendered from august though december accordingly  during fiscal year and fiscal year we recorded million and million  respectively  for the cost sharing arrangement 
equity in loss of affiliate in may  we and other linux vendors including connectiva  suse and turbolinux announced the organization of unitedlinux  a new initiative that will streamline linux development and certification around a global  uniform distribution of linux for business 
in connection with the unitedlinux effort  we made a non refundable  capital contribution to unitedlinux llc in return for a percent ownership interest in this entity 
the entity s purpose is to oversee the development and provide direction to the unitedlinux initiative 
because we have a greater than percent ownership interest in this entity  the investment has been recorded using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our portion of the net loss of unitedlinux llc in our consolidated statements of operations  which for fiscal year  was estimated to be equal to our initial capital contribution 
until january   we had been accounting for our investment in ebiz enterprises  inc ebiz using the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognized our allocable portion of the net loss of ebiz in our consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year and fiscal year  we recognized million and million  respectively  related to our portion of ebiz s net loss and the amortization of the difference between our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the net assets of ebiz 
subsequent to january   our investment in ebiz was accounted for under the cost method as our ownership interest in ebiz was diluted to less than percent as a result of ebiz issuing new shares in connection with an acquisition and the conversion of convertible securities 
during fiscal year  ebiz s financial condition declined and ebiz filed for bankruptcy protection 
accordingly  our investment was written down to other income expense  net other income expense  net  which consists principally of interest expense  interest income and other income  was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year is attributable to less interest income earned from lower cash balances 
the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to a million gain recognized on the sale of the electronic linux marketplace assets during fiscal year provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the provision for income taxes was related to earnings in foreign subsidiaries 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million that expire at various dates between and the company had net deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences between book and tax deductions  totaling approximately million as of october  a valuation allowance in the amount of million has been recorded as of october  as a result of uncertainties regarding the realizability of the net deferred tax asset balance

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the last eight quarters 
this information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements  which  in management s opinion  have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarter ended january  april  july  october  unaudited in thousands  except per share data fiscal year revenue     gross margin     loss from operations     net loss to common stockholders    basic and diluted net loss per common share weighted average basic and diluted common shares   quarter ended january  april  july  october  unaudited in thousands  except per share data fiscal year revenue     gross margin deficit   loss from operations     net loss to common stockholders    basic and diluted net loss per common share weighted average basic and diluted common shares   fluctuations in quarterly results factors that may affect quarterly results include the interest level of solution providers in recommending linux and unix business solutions to end users  the introduction  development  timing  competitive pricing and market acceptance of our products and services and those of our competitors  changes in general economic conditions  such as recessions  that could affect capital expenditures and recruiting efforts in the software industry in general and in the linux and unix environments in particular  and changing business attitudes toward linux and unix as viable operating system alternatives to other competing systems 
as a result of the factors listed above and elsewhere in the risk factors section of this form k  it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may fall below management s expectations as well as the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if revenue falls below management s expectations in any quarter and we are unable to reduce spending quickly in response  operating results would be lower than expected 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through loans from our principal stockholder  and through sales of common and preferred stock 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  management implemented significant cost reduction measures 
we reduced our employees from at the time of the tarantella acquisition in may to as of october  our unaudited quarterly operating loss  excluding non cash expenses and asset write downs  has been reduced from  for the quarter ended october  to  for the quarter ended october  management believes that our operations will continue to be near breakeven before non cash expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year in december  we obtained a  line of credit from a commercial bank 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by a letter of credit from our principal stockholder 
as a result of the cost reductions and based on forecasted revenue and availability under the line of credit  management believes that we will have sufficient cash to fund its operations through fiscal year if our actual quarterly revenue is less than forecasted  management believes additional reductions in operating expenses can be made if necessary 
we have engaged an investment banking firm to assist in obtaining additional equity or debt funding to provide additional working capital and funding for growth and expansion 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving forecasted results or in obtaining additional equity or debt capital in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our principal stockholder has confirmed its intent to provide additional financial support in the form of either capital  loans  direct or indirect guarantees of loans or other direct or indirect injections of funds to enable us to continue as a going concern through november as of october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million  which included million of deferred revenue that does not require dollar for dollar of cash to settle 
our total cash and equivalents decreased by million from october  to october  this decrease primarily resulted from cash used in operations of million  million of cash used in the settlement of our million face value note payable to tarantella and million of cash used to purchase shares of our common stock held by two significant shareholders  offset by million of proceeds from available for sale securities 
cash used in operations of million was primarily attributable to the net loss of million partially offset by non cash expenses of million and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
cash used in operations declined in fiscal year primarily due to our cost cutting actions 
net cash used in operations during fiscal year was million 
cash used in operations was primarily attributed to the net loss of million  which was offset by non cash charges for the write down of goodwill and intangible assets of million  the write down of investments of million  the amortization of goodwill and intangibles of million  depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  and other non cash charges of million 
cash used in operating activities from the changes in operating assets and liabilities was approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities during fiscal year was million 
cash used in operating activities was primarily attributed to the net loss of million 
we also paid million to sun microsystems  inc for certain rights to license software 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges for the amortization of stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of approximately million 
our investing activities have historically consisted of equipment purchases  investing in strategic partners and the purchase and sale of available for sale securities 
during fiscal year  cash provided by investing activities was million  which was primarily generated from the sale of million of available for sale securities  offset by an investment in a non marketable security of million 
cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal year this consisted of million paid  net of cash acquired  for the assets and operations from tarantella and the whatiflinux technology from acrylis as well as million paid for the purchase of equipment 
the cash uses were more than offset by proceeds from sales of available for sale securities  net of purchases  of million 
during fiscal year  cash used in investing activities was million 
approximately million was used in purchases  net of sales  of available for sale securities to seek to maximize the yield on available cash balances 
additionally  during fiscal year  we invested million in the common stock of evergreen internet  inc  a strategic partner  paid million to ebiz for million shares of common stock and paid million for property and equipment 
we also received million from the sale of million shares of lineo s common stock 
our financing activities used million of cash during fiscal year and consisted primarily of a million payment to retire the note payable to tarantella and million for the purchase of shares of our common stock held by two investors 
these were offset by million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares of common stock by our employees through our employee stock purchase program of million 
during fiscal year our financing activities provided approximately million of cash as a result of the exercise of vested stock options  the purchase of shares of common stock through our employee stock purchase program and from minority stockholders in our majority owned japanese subsidiary 
financing activities provided million during fiscal year the primary sources of cash during fiscal year included net proceeds of million received in connection with the series b preferred stock financing completed in january and net proceeds of million received in connection with the initial public offering in march we also received million from a stock subscription receivable 
our net accounts receivable balance decreased from million as of october  to million as of october   primarily related to strong collection efforts and a decline in revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of october   which represented approximately four percent of our gross accounts receivable balance 
our write offs of uncollectable accounts have not been material 
we also generate revenue in central and south america 
historically  revenue and expenses in this region have not been significant 
in recent quarters  the economies of the countries of this region have experienced significant volatility 
we have reviewed our sales to customers and our accounts receivable from customers in this region and have established reserves for potential bad debts as we believe appropriate 
we believe our overall exposure related to transactions in this region is not material 
we have entered into operating leases for our corporate offices located in the united states and our international sales offices 
we have commitments under these leases that extend through fiscal year in recent corporate restructuring activities  we have partially vacated some of these facilities  but still have contractual obligations to continue to make ongoing lease payments that will use available cash 
we have pursued and will continue to pursue sublease opportunities  as available  to minimize this use of cash  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in eliminating or reducing cash expenditures for these leases 
the following table summarizes our contractual lease obligations as of october  in thousands operating leases less than one year  one to three years  three or more years  total payments  in connection with the acquisition of the server and professional services groups from tarantella  tarantella agreed to continue as the lessee for certain facilities in the united kingdom that it would retain and use 
we and tarantella have completed assignment agreements for these leases and tarantella will be the lease tenant and will have financial responsibility for these leases 
however  our united kingdom subsidiary remained on these operating leases as a second guarantor  and may be liable under these lease obligations in the event that tarantella defaults 
future operating lease payments under these leases extend through and total million 
this potential obligation is not included in the above table 
we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  income taxes and related valuation allowances  software development costs  impairment of long lived assets  and allowances for doubtful accounts and product returns 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of accounting position sop  as amended  and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of resulting receivables is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable  except for sales to distributors  which are recognized upon sale by the distributor to resellers or end users 
for contracts involving multiple elements ie delivered and undelivered products  maintenance and other services  we allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value  which is specific to us 
the fair value of each element is based on amounts charged when such elements are sold separately 
we recognize revenue allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenue set forth above have been met 
we recognize revenue from maintenance fees for ongoing customer support and product updates ratably over the period of the maintenance contract 
payments for maintenance fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
for revenue allocated to education and consulting services or derived from the separate sale of such services  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
we recognize product revenue from royalty payments upon receipt of quarterly royalty reports from oems related to their product sales 
further implementation guidelines relating to sop and related modifications may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices and such changes could significantly affect our future revenue and results of operations 
we have provided a valuation allowance of million against our entire net deferred tax asset as of october  the valuation allowance was recorded because of our history of net operating losses and the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability and taxable income 
had different assumptions been used regarding the valuation allowance and our net deferred tax asset  our income tax provision benefit could have been materially different than that reported 
software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
internally generated software development costs incurred after technological feasibility was established and prior to product release were not material for fiscal years  and we charge our software development costs to research and development expense in its consolidated statements of operations 
a change in our policy could significantly affect our future expenses related to software development 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate  at each balance sheet date  whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate possible impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated cumulative undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the long lived asset 
subsequent to the acquisition of certain assets and operations from tarantella  we experienced significant unanticipated decreases in actual and forecasted revenue of the acquired operations  a significant decline in market valuations and general conditions  particularly in the information technology sector  a weakening of partner relationships  the loss of certain key executives and other factors which indicated the recorded values of the long lived assets were impaired 
as a result  we performed a valuation of our long lived assets as of october  and concluded that a million write down of goodwill and intangible assets was necessary 
as a result of this write down and other smaller purchase price adjustments  at october   we have a net remaining balance for intangible assets of million and a net remaining balance for goodwill of had different assumptions or criteria been used to evaluate and measure the impairment  the amount of the impairment write off could have been materially different than the million recorded 
further write downs of goodwill and intangibles may be necessary if the future cash flows of these assets are less than the carrying value 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a significant majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all accounts receivable 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical experience 
our actual bad debts and returns may differ from our estimates and the differences may be material

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we have foreign offices and operations primarily in europe and asia 
as a result  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
most of this international revenue is denominated in us dollars 
however  most of the operating expenses related to the foreign based operations are denominated in foreign currencies and therefore operating results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate in relation to foreign currencies such as the uk pound sterling and the euro  among others 
if the us dollar weakens compared to the uk pound sterling and the euro  our operating expenses of foreign operations will be higher when translated back into us dollars and additional funds may be required to meet these obligations 
our revenue can also be affected by general economic conditions in the united states  europe and other international markets 
our results of operations may be affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  these amounts have not been significant 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our cash management strategy is to invest available funds in a manner that assures maximum safety and liquidity and maximizes yield within such constraints 
we do not borrow money for short term investment purposes 
investment risk we have invested in equity instruments of privately held and public companies in the high technology industry for business and strategic purposes 
investments are accounted for under the cost method if our ownership is less than percent and we are not able to exercise influence over operations 
our investment policy is to regularly review the assumptions and operating performance of these companies and to record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that these investments may be impaired 
as of october   our investments balance was approximately million 
the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations 
in addition  factors such as new product introductions by our competitors and us may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  quarter to quarter fluctuations in our results of operations caused by changes in customer demand may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock 
these conditions could cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time
