item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with forward looking statements this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements include  but are not limited to  statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses  anticipated lease up and rental concessions at development properties  planned asset dispositions  disposition pricing  and planned acquisition and developments 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this report on form k will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material or adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control the company s ability to generate sufficient cash in order to make distributions to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of scheduled principal payments on debt and capital expenditure requirements 
funds from operations and the value of the company s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company s control 
such events or conditions could include competition from other apartment communities  overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in the company s markets  which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and or require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units  increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset by increased rents  the company s inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms  changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance  changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing  which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates drop and home loans are available more readily or increase the company s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available  weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing  decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the company s joint ventures  and the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 
currently  the company s funds available for distribution are insufficient to fully finance the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  any significant further deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate 
any decline in the company s funds from operations or property values because of these factors which are beyond its control could adversely affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the company s stock price 
debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results at december   the company had total debt outstanding of million 
payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the company intends to keep its total debt below of the undepreciated book value of its assets  although the company s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels 
circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time 
as of december   the company s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 
the company s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  the company must repay its debt upon maturity  and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company s financial condition and or its funds from operations 
variable interest rates may adversely affect our funds from operations at december   approximately million of the company s debt bore interest at a variable rate 
in addition  the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates 
variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase  which would adversely affect the company s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders 
the company s million credit facility with fannie mae is predominately a floating rate facility  the interest rates on which have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps 
upon the termination of these swaps and caps  the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 
increasing insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition because the company has substantial real estate holdings  the cost of insuring its properties is a significant item of expense 
due to the events of september  and other recent disasters  premiums for property and casualty insurance have risen significantly in recent months 
if the cost of property and casualty insurance continues to rise  its cost of doing business would likely rise  which may in turn negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  in that they require the most subjective judgments  form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  and fair value of derivative financial instruments 
capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for land improvements and buildings  to years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment  all of which are judgmental determinations 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements  renovations  and replacements are capitalized 
the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company s standards are capitalized as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance  market conditions  and legal factors 
to evaluate goodwill and the recovery value of long lived assets  the company estimates future operating cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset s fair value 
in the apartment industry the primary method used for determining fair values is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate 
the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in the community s market or submarket 
fair value of derivative financial instruments the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments during the normal course of business to manage  or hedge  the interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 
the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective 
the company performs effectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter  through the maturity of the hedge 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
while the company s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations  the historical correlation of the rates of the hedge and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedge and have been highly related 
overview the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
as of december   the total number of apartment units the company owned or had an ownership interest in  including the properties containing  apartment units owned by the company s joint ventures was  in communities  compared to the  apartment units in communities owned at december   and the  apartment units in communities owned at december  for properties owned by the company  the average monthly rental per apartment unit  excluding units in lease up  increased to at december  from at december  and at december  for these same units  overall occupancy at december   and was  and  respectively 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo represents net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap excluding extraordinary items  minority interest in operating partnership income  gain or loss on disposition of real estate assets  plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate  and adjustments for the joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit recommended definition 
the company s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting  vinyl flooring  and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties 
during the stabilization period for acquisition properties  these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties  and  thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company s results of operations in that such calculation reflects the company s ability to support interest payments and general operating expenses before the impact of certain activities such as changes in other assets and accounts payable 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company views the amount paid to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values as experienced in in relation to the retirement of its series e preferred stock as comparable to an extraordinary item for ffo purposes 
ffo decreased during by approximately  to  versus  in and  in  principally because of reduced occupancy and increased concessions at properties owned for more than a year 
net income decreased during by approximately  to  versus  in and  in  principally because and experienced net gains of  and  respectively  related to dispositions of assets 
in the company did not sell any assets 
in and the company sold a total of  units under its disposition strategy  discussed earlier in this annual report  and reallocated the majority of the proceeds from those sales to the reduction of debt  the share repurchase program and the completion of development properties

trends property revenues during the year ended december   were impacted by general economic weakness and excess supply of apartments  which was evident throughout the majority of the company s portfolio 
the decrease in new household formations and single family home purchases due to historically low interest rates have affected demand in many of the company s markets  which has created extremely competitive leasing environments 
these dynamics are expected to continue for the next several quarters 
current occupancy rates  rent growth  and concession levels are not at historical levels and are not expected to improve until the national economy improves

net cash used in financing activities decreased from approximately  for to approximately  during during the company increased its borrowings under its credit lines by  as compared to a decrease of  in mainly related to refinancings of individual mortgages and the purchase of the preston hills apartments 
during  the company used  to repurchase shares of its common stock 
no shares were repurchased during in august  the company negotiated an increase from million to million in the borrowing capacity of its existing secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital  credit enhanced by fannie mae the fnma facility 
the expanded capacity may be utilized only as additional collateral is pledged to secure the facility 
at december  the fnma facility had an outstanding balance of million on an available borrowing base of million 
million of the fnma facility expires in  renewable for two successive year terms  while the remaining million expires in  renewable for a year term 
the company plans to utilize the additional facility capacity to refinance debt maturities over the next months 
the fnma facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate on the variable portion renews every days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security dmbs rate on the date of renewal  which has typically approximated three month libor less an average spread of  plus a credit enhancement fee of based on the outstanding borrowings 
the variable interest rate at december  was on variable rate borrowings of million 
fixed rate borrowings under the fnma facility totaled million at december   at interest rates inclusive of credit enhancement fees from to  and maturities from to compass bank provides an unsecured credit facility to the company 
outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  were million 
the company currently maintains a million secured credit facility with a group of banks led by amsouth bank 
there was  outstanding under this facility at december  available borrowing base capacity under this facility was million at december  each of the company s credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage 
if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing  the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
moreover  if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility  after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default  accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and or foreclose on properties securing such facilities 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk 
the company has five interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of million which have variable legs based on one or three month libor  and fixed legs with an average rate of 
the swaps have expirations between and  and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the company s designated variable rate borrowings of its fnma facility 
the company has designed these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on its fnma facility 
through the use of these swaps the company believes it has effectively fixed the borrowing rate during these periods of million of variable rate borrowings issued through the fnma facility  leaving only  of the fnma facility of which the interest rate has not been fixed or hedged 
additionally  the company has a  tax free bond facility with fnma 
the company has three interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of  which have variable legs based on the bma municipal swap index and fixed legs with an average rate of 
these swaps expire in and  and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the designated borrowings of the tax free bond facility 
the company also entered into a cap agreement on a notional amount of million within the tax free bond facility 
the year cap agreement has a strike rate of as indexed on the bma municipal swap index 
the company has also executed five forward interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of million all of which go into effect in the variable legs of these forward interest rate swaps are based on three month libor and the fixed legs have an average rate of 
the swaps have lives from two to seven years and are designated as cash flow hedges on future planned refinancings 
in  the company had approximating million of debt maturing including the million of bond indebtedness of mid america capital partners  lp  which it funded by debt issued under the fnma facility 
the rate on the maturing debt is and the rate on the replacement debt which has been pre set through forward interest rate swaps is 
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity at december   for the million of debt outstanding were and years  compared to and years on million of debt outstanding at december  on october   the company closed the sale of  shares of a new series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock series f preferred stock at per share for an aggregate principal amount of million 
on october   the company privately placed  shares of a new series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock series g preferred stock at per share for an aggregate principal amount of million 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock along with million of debt were used to repurchase and retire all of the  shares of the company s series e cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a premium totaling million including the write off of previous issuance costs for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund both its current operations  annual refurbishment of its properties  and incremental investment in new apartment properties 
the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities  and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma  which provides credit enhancement for nearly million of the company s debt 
the market for fnma dmbs  which in the company s experience is highly effective with three month libor interest rates  is also an important component of the company s liquidity and swap effectiveness 
in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient  or the credit of fnma becomes impaired  the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 
the company believes that cash provided by operations is adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate in both the short and long term to meet operating requirements including recurring capital expenditures at the communities and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements under the internal revenue code 
the company has loan covenants that limit the total amount of distributions  but believes that it is unlikely that these will be a limiting factor on the company s future levels of distributions based on the company s current range of forecast of operating performance 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  preferred stock redemptions  expansions  and non recurring capital expenditures  through long and medium term collateralized fixed rate borrowings  potential joint venture transactions and the company s credit facilities 
currently  the company s operating cash flow is insufficient to fully finance the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  any significant further deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate 
the following table reflects the company s total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long term debt as of december  dollars in s long term debt thereafter total off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
the company s joint venture with blackstone was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in revenues from the sale 
the company s joint venture with crow holdings was established to acquire approximately million of multifamily properties 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
the company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationships with the company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in
