sales of industrial automation products decreased  or  due to decreased volume demand for these products resulting from lower capital equipment spending globally 
net sales for the year ended july  declined to  or from  for the year ended july  the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to continuation of the global manufacturing recession s impact on capital equipment markets 
following a sales decline of year over year in the first three quarters of  the fourth quarter sales were comparable to sales of industrial automation products decreased  or 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended july  decreased  or to  from  for the year ended july  the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to continued downward price pressure in many of the company products  and a shift to lower margin products during the second half of the year as product mix continued to shift between scale components and complete scale systems 
traditionally  the company s complete scale system products earn substantially higher gross profit than the load cell or scale components product line 
gross profit for the year ended july  decreased  or to  from  for the year ended july  the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower sales volume  however  the contribution of the benefit of outsourcing products to lower cost producers resulted in a significant improvement in the gross margin percentage

second  the plan called for development of offshore manufacturing sources to reduce costs on certain high volume  highly competitive load cells and sensors 
the third component of the plan was for a downsizing of the company s tustin  california  headquarters and manufacturing facility to a more appropriately sized facility in the same general area 
in recognition of the expenses associated with this restructuring  the company recorded a  charge in fiscal to cover expenses related to implementation of the plan and costs associated with elimination of fixed assets and employee severance

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventory and stock adjustments  for reasonableness 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
si technologies  inc si or company designs  manufactures and markets high performance industrial sensors  weighing and factory automation equipment  and related products 
si products incorporate devices  equipment and systems for the handling  inspection and measurement of goods and materials 
key markets served by si include aerospace aviation  food  forestry  manufacturing  mining  transportation distribution and waste management 
the company sells throughout the united states and international markets 
approximately of total revenues are international 
additional disclosure regarding components of the company s businesses is in note n industry and geographic area segment information 
equity compensation plan information the company accounts for stock based employee compensation under the requirements of apb opinion no 
 which does not require compensation to be recorded if the consideration to be received is at least equal to fair value at the measurement date 
nonemployee stock based transactions and stock warrants are accounted for under the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires compensation to be recorded based on the fair value of the securities issued or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue only when all of the four following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  usually in the form of a written purchase order  delivery has occurred or a shipment has been made  depending upon the terms of the purchase order or services have been rendered  the company s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  usually evidenced by a written purchase order  and collectability is reasonably assured  based on credit evaluation and history with the customer 
additionally  on long term contracts  sales are recorded based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the total estimated costs at completion 
estimated cost to complete is based on the budget  incurred cost  risk assessment of the cost  and is then adjusted for normal historical variance of project actual versus budget 
estimated losses are recorded in total when they become evident 
these contracts are generally billed and collected based on contractual milestones throughout the project 
reserves valuation allowances are maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
all receivable accounts are reviewed regularly by management and written off against the uncollectable reserve when it is determined that the account cannot reasonably be expected to be collected 
recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
no interest is charged on past due accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
each quarter  the company evaluates its inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
these estimates are dependent on the company s assessment of current and expected orders from its customers 
management estimates a reserve percentage for the estimated net realizable value of slow moving product based upon the number of years sales on hand 
the company reserves for potential excess and obsolete inventory based upon historical usage 
the company offers warranties of various lengths to its customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
the average length of the warranty period is months 
the company s warranties require it to repair or replace defective products during the warrant period at no cost to the customer 
at the time the product revenue is recognized  the company records a liability for estimated costs that may be incurred under its warranties 
the costs are estimated based on historical experience and any specific warranty issues that may have been identified 
although historical warranty costs have been within expectations  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
the company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the balance as necessary 
management also records a valuation allowance to reduce the company s deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management considers estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
income taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and deferred tax liabilities  including operating loss carryforwards  are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives  principally on a straight line basis 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
estimated service lives of property and equipment are as follows machinery and equipment to years buildings years leasehold improvements to years the straight line method of depreciation is followed for substantially all assets for financial reporting purposes  while accelerated methods are used for tax purposes 
goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted sfas effective august  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company was required to carry out a transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  which requires an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired as of the date of adoption 
initially  the company identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities including goodwill to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
if the fair value of a reporting unit was below the unit s carrying amount  as computed in step one  the company must complete step two of the transitional goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit as soon as possible  but not later than the end of the year of adoption 
if the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its recorded goodwill  a transitional goodwill impairment loss will be recognized and reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting changes 
any subsequent impairment losses resulting from events or circumstances that occur after the first day of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
is adopted will be reported as a component of income from continuing or discontinued operations  as appropriate 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 management determined there were three reporting units 
the carrying value of each respective reporting unit was compared to its current fair value determined using a discounted future cash flows approach 
due to the fair value of each reporting unit exceeding its carrying value  management determined no impairment existed 
management completed its annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of july   and further concluded that no additional impairment exists 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews its long lived assets  including patents  to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including cash flows from disposition 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  the company would recognize an impairment loss at that date 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value estimated discounted future cash flows of the long lived assets 
for the year ended july   management has determined that no impairment of long lived assets  including patents  exists 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances or changes to the company s business strategy  could result in the actual useful lives of long lived assets differing from initial estimates 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulator requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  the company will amortize or depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value of its revised remaining useful life 
use of estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates and assumptions made by management are used for  but not limited to  the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory  warrant obligations  excess facility capacity  deferred tax valuation allowances and recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill 
pending accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation defines a variable interest entity and provides that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
furthermore  the board indicates that the voting interest approach of arb no 
is not effective in identifying controlling financial interests in entities that are not controllable through voting interest or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risk 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  management believes the implementation of this interpretation will not have a material effect upon the company s consolidated financial statements
