     the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
management regularly reviews its loan portfolio and charge off experience to maintain the allowance at a level management feels is adequate

results of operations the operating results of the company depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
net interest income is determined by the difference between yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities the interest rate spread and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  the company s net earnings are also affected by the level of nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate  as well as the level of its noninterest income  and its noninterest expenses  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment costs and income taxes

at december   the company had commitments to originate loans totaling million 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the months following december  totaled million 
management believes the company has adequate resources to fund all of its commitments  that substantially all of its existing commitments will be funded within the next twelve months and  if so desired  that it can adjust the rates on certificates of deposit to attract deposits in a changing interest rate environment

the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and percentages set forth in the following table of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december  and  that the company and the bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
under federal reserve board regulations  the bank is required to meet certain minimum regulatory capital requirements 
this is not a valuation allowance and has not been created by charges against earnings 
it represents a restriction on stockholders equity 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulatory authorities categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  an institution must maintain minimum total risk based  tier i risk based  and tier i leverage percentages as set forth in the following tables 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s category 
the company and the bank s actual capital amounts and capital percentages as of december  and are also presented in the table dollars in thousands

management believes that these processes and procedures provide the company with better capital planning  asset mix and volume controls  loan pricing guidelines  and deposit interest rate guidelines which should result in tighter controls and less exposure to interest rate risk 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
the gap ratio is computed as dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap ratio of represents perfect matching 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases in interest rates on the results of operations  the company s management continues to monitor asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
such policies have consisted primarily of i emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans  ii maintaining a stable core deposit base  and iii maintaining a significant portion of liquid assets cash and short term investments

although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary importance  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
while consumer loans generally involve a higher element of credit risk than one to four family residential loans  consumer loans are typically made at higher interest rates and for shorter terms  or at adjustable rates  and are helpful in maintaining a profitable spread between the bank s loan yield and its cost of funds
