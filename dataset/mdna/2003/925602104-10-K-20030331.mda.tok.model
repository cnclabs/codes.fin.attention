item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements above 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we research and develop biopharmaceutical products based on our patented dna delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life threatening diseases 
in addition to advancing our core technology  we have gained access to additional enhancing technologies through licensing and collaborative agreements 
we believe the following areas of research offer the greatest potential for our product development efforts vaccines for use in high risk populations for infectious disease targets for which there are significant us needs  vaccines for general pediatric or adult populations for infectious disease applications for which a challenge model or accepted surrogate marker are available  and cancer vaccines or immunotherapies which complement our existing programs and core expertise 
for opportunities outside these areas  we plan to continue leveraging our patented technology through licensing and collaborations 
in addition  we plan to use our expertise  infrastructure  and financial strength to explore in licensing or acquisition opportunities 
we have established relationships through licensing our technology to a number of commercial entities  including merck co  inc  two divisions of aventis sa aventis pasteur  and aventis pharmaceuticals inc  merial  centocor  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  invitrogen corporation  human genome sciences  inc  and vascular genetics inc  which recently merged into corautus genetics inc we have also licensed poloxamer technologies from cytrx corporation 
to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of our products 
we earn revenue from licensing access to our proprietary technology  and by performing services under research and development contracts and manufacturing contracts 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the expansion of our research and development programs  the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials  spending for outside services  costs related to maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  our relocation to pcc  and possible advancement toward commercialization activities 
losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the levels of expenses incurred and the amounts of revenues received from various sources 
such fluctuations may be significant 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect our net loss for to be between million and million 
our net loss of million for included a million write down of our investment in vgi 
the anticipated decrease in net loss for compared with is due to the aforementioned vgi write down  partially offset by the expected higher expenses related to preclinical research and development programs  consolidation of our facilities into a new location  and an anticipated decline in investment income 
change in accounting principle in the fourth quarter of  we completed an evaluation of payments we received under our various option and license agreements 
we identified a agreement with pfizer  which we believed  under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  would require a change in accounting as of sab s implementation date of january  the amount of revenue recognized in that under sab was required to be deferred as of january   was million 
we implemented sab in the fourth quarter of  by restating the first three quarters of our financial statements to apply sab effective january  our statement of operations for reflects a one time charge to earnings of million for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as of january  in  we recognized million of the deferred license revenue from pfizer  after recognizing million per year in and results of operations revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared with revenues of million for the year ended december  license royalty revenue in was million and consisted of recognition of license payments from merial and centocor totaling million  recognition of deferred license fees primarily from merial and vgi totaling million  and royalty revenue of million on the sale of proprietary lipids by invitrogen 
contract revenue in was million and included revenues from the nih  principally for manufacturing of dna for infectious disease vaccines  and contracts from iavi and from the onr  for development work on an investigational dna vaccine to prevent malaria 
the agreement between vical and the onr provided revenue of million from its execution in september through its expiration on september  license royalty revenue of million in included scheduled milestone payments of million from merck and million from centocor  and royalty and other revenue of million 
license revenue in also included recognition of deferred license fees of million from merial and vgi  and of million primarily from the pfizer agreement as a result of applying the change in accounting principle discussed in the section above 
contract revenue of million for included million of revenues from the contract with the onr  revenue from contracts and grants with nih  and revenue from pfizer and other agreements 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december  license royalty revenue of million in included million of license fees from a june license agreement with aventis pharmaceuticals and royalty and other revenue of million 
license revenue in also included recognition of deferred license fees of million from merial and vgi and of million from the pfizer agreement as a result of applying the change in accounting principle discussed in the section above 
contract revenue of million for included million of revenues from the contract with the onr  revenue from contracts and grants with nih  and revenue from pfizer and other agreements 
research and development expenses increased to million in compared with million in this increase primarily was due to increased personnel costs  and higher facilities related and preclinical costs 
research and development expenses were million in research and development expenses were higher in than in due to increased personnel  facilities  preclinical and intellectual property costs 
clinical trial costs decreased to million in due to completion of the low dose allovectin registration trials in and discontinuing the leuvectin kidney cancer trial 
clinical trials expense decreased to million in from million in due to the discontinuation of the leuvectin kidney cancer clinical trial 
as we move forward in  we expect research and development expense to increase as we expand our preclinical programs to broaden our future pipeline 
we further expect these efforts to drive increases in spending for outside services  and costs related to intellectual property 
we also expect to incur increased costs as a result of relocation to pcc and possible preparation for commercialization activities 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared with million in  and million in general and administrative expenses increased in compared with primarily due to increased personnel related costs and increased facilities costs 
the increase in compared with was attributable primarily to increased costs for support personnel  travel  and increased consultant and professional fees 
operating expenses in also included a write down of our investment in vgi  now corautus 
in february  we received shares of series b preferred stock in vgi in exchange for granting vgi a license to our technology 
vgi was a privately held company developing gene based delivery of the angiogenic growth factor vegf for cardiovascular applications 
no cash was received or paid by either party to this transaction 
the shares were recorded as an investment on our balance sheet at estimated fair value  which was million on the date of investment 
the preferred stock was convertible into common stock of vgi 
in september  genstar therapeutics  a public company listed on the amex  and vgi announced a merger that would result in the creation of a new entity  corautus 
we evaluated our investment in vgi based on the five day average share price of genstar therapeutics immediately before and after the merger announcement and concluded that it was necessary to write down our investment in vgi to a fair value of million  reflecting the objective values established as a result of the proposed merger 
accordingly  the results of operations reflected a write down of million to reduce our recorded investment in vgi to its fair value of million 
the merger closed in february and the shares of corautus began trading on amex 
investment income decreased to million in compared with million in  and million in investment income included realized gains on sales of marketable securities of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
investment income  excluding the gains on the sale of investments  decreased in both and primarily due to significantly lower investment rates of return 
some of our investments are yielding higher returns than we can expect when reinvesting the proceeds upon maturity 
thus  our interest yields are expected to be lower in the lower interest yields and lower investment balances are expected to result in lower investment income in interest expense was million in and compared with million in indebtedness for capital leases was higher in compared with  but lower outstanding balances on bank debt and lower interest rates offset this increase 
the increase in compared with was due to higher average balances of capital lease obligations and bank notes payable 
interest expense is expected to increase in as the capital lease obligation increases due to increased capital spending principally for pcc 
net loss for was million or per share 
net loss for included a million write down of our investment in vgi 
net loss for was higher than for due to lower revenues  higher expenses  the write down of our vgi investment and lower investment income  as explained above 
for  we reported a net loss of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for the net loss for included a one time charge to earnings of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  this one time charge was to reflect the impact of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we reported a loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million for  compared with million for the increase in loss for compared with before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was primarily a result of lower investment income and higher research and development spending 
other matters since inception  we estimate that we have spent approximately million on research and development 
approximately million of this amount was for our two cancer programs  allovectin  which is currently in a high dose phase ii trial in melanoma  but for which we have elected not to proceed with a bla filing based on low dose clinical trials  and leuvectin  for which development was discontinued in september due to other priorities 
the majority of this million was for allovectin 
we expect this phase ii trial to determine whether higher dosing will provide the level of efficacy needed to support further development 
additionally  we are in the early stages of research and development of vaccine candidates for infectious diseases such as cmv and anthrax 
these infectious disease candidates will require significant costs to advance through the development stages 
see product development cancer therapies allovectin for a more detailed explanation of the status of allovectin 
see also product development dna vaccines for infectious diseases cytomegalovirus and anthrax for more detailed discussions of our cmv and anthrax vaccine programs 
we have several other product candidates in the research stage 
it can take many years from the initial decision to screen product candidates  perform preclinical and safety studies  and perform clinical trials leading up to possible fda approval of a product 
the outcome of the research is unknown until each stage of the testing is completed  up through and including the registration clinical trials 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and cost to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have a product approved by the fda 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million compared with million at december  cash and marketable securities  including restricted securities  totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  in january  we sold  shares of common stock in a public offering which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
cash used in operating activities increased to million in compared with million in  principally due to a higher net loss  and an increase in receivables and other assets 
these increases more than offset the positive cash flow from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  accrued level rent adjustment  and non cash charges such as depreciation 
net loss for included a non cash write down of our investment in vgi 
in addition we recorded an expense of million for the difference between our remaining lease obligations and the amounts we expect to recover by subleasing the vacated space in our older facilities  including a million write down of the unamortized balance of leasehold improvements 
cash used in operating activities was million in compared with million in  despite a higher net loss  because of increases in non cash charges such as depreciation and deferred compensation 
positive cash flow from the reduction in receivables together with increased accounts payable and accrued expenses more than offset the negative impact of the increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided from investing activities was million in compared with million in net sales of securities were lower in because in we sold marketable securities and invested in cash equivalents of a shorter term 
in  we also paid million for a license to certain technology 
capital expenditures were higher in because we borrowed under a financing agreement to expand the research facility 
in  most of the cash expenditures for pcc were funded by the landlord as part of the tenant improvement allowance provided in the lease agreement 
cash used in investing activities was million in  and related principally to our use of the net proceeds from our public offering in that year to invest in marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities in was million compared with cash provided from financing activities of million in the increased use of cash in compared with was primarily a result of having no proceeds from notes payable in compared with million of proceeds from notes payable in an increase in payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations in compared with also contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities 
to finance certain leasehold improvements we borrowed from a bank million in and million in these borrowings converted to term loans payable over months in june and june  respectively 
the term loans bear interest approximating the bank s prime rate 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the term loans were million  and had interest rates of percent and percent  respectively 
cash provided from financing activities was million in  principally as a result of our january public offering of  shares of vical common stock  which raised net proceeds of approximately million 
in and  payments on notes payable and capital leases increased over the respective prior year due to increased balances of notes payable and capital lease obligations 
in  we expect that our total net cash used will exceed our projected net loss principally because of timing of cash receipts on certain contract work 
capital equipment spending  including amounts financed under capital leases  will be significantly higher in due to our relocation to pcc 
in november  we entered into a new lease line with our primary lender to provide up to million of lease financing through november  this financing replaced our previous capital equipment line which was renewed in january the new lease line includes approximately million of credit for tenant improvements and equipment for pcc 
at december   million of borrowings were made against this lease line 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an expense of million for the expected loss on vacant leased space that is expected to be subleased at rental rates less than those incurred by us and on the unamortized balance of leasehold improvements 
in march  we subleased to a third party approximately half of the vacated space 
we will attempt to sublease the remaining vacant space in our older facilities to recover our existing rent payments plus amortization of leasehold improvements 
however  if we are unable to do so  our net loss and cash outlays will increase accordingly 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  including continued increases in personnel costs  costs related to preclinical testing  outside services  facilities  intellectual property and possible commercialization costs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the impact of competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and possible commercialization activities and arrangements 
we may seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we anticipate that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our operating needs through at least we do not utilize special purpose entities for any transactions 
our only off balance sheet obligations are for operating leases that are disclosed in note of the notes to financial statements 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas investment 
in february  we received shares of series b preferred stock in vgi  in exchange for granting vgi a license to our technology 
vgi was a privately held company 
no cash was received or paid by either party to this transaction 
the shares were recorded as an investment on our balance sheet at estimated fair value  which was million on the date of investment 
the preferred stock was convertible into common stock of vgi 
in september  genstar therapeutics  a public company listed on the amex  and vgi announced a merger which resulted in the creation of a new entity  corautus 
the merger closed in february of subsequent to the merger  the shares of corautus are traded on amex 
we evaluated our investment in vgi based on the five day average share price of genstar therapeutics immediately before and after the merger announcement and concluded that it was necessary to write down the investment in vgi to a fair value of million  reflecting the objective values established as a result of the proposed merger 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december   reflected a write down of million to reduce the recorded investment in vgi to million 
this investment is reflected as investment in the accompanying balance sheets 
through the remainder of  the investment was accounted for using the cost method 
beginning in  our investment in corautus is expected to be accounted for as an available for sale security 
accordingly  any change in the fair value of the shares we own based on the market price of the traded shares will be reflected as unrealized gain or loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet at the end of each quarter 
corautus still needs to raise substantial cash to complete its development plans  and there can be no assurance that its developmental therapy for angiogenesis will work or that the fda will approve such a treatment 
corautus may not be able to raise such funds or successfully commercialize a product even if it receives fda approval 
we may incur a further write down of up to million if we were to sell our shares on the open market at below our cost or due to impairment which is other than temporary if corautus is unable to successfully complete its development plans 
loss on sublease 
in  we initiated activities to sublease space that was vacated when we moved most employees to pcc 
we recorded an expense of million for the expected loss on vacant leased space that is expected to be subleased at rental rates less than those incurred by us 
the expense also included a million write down of the unamortized balance of leasehold improvements at the date we expect to vacate the old facilities 
in march  we subleased to a third party approximately half of the vacated space 
if the final negotiated sublease rates or the number of months we are able to sublease the remaining vacated space are less than the amounts we assumed  we may need to significantly adjust our estimated accrual  which in turn  could affect our results of operations and cash flow 
intangible assets 
we capitalize the license fees we pay to acquire access to proprietary technology if the technology is expected to have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
the cost of licensed technology rights is amortized to expense over the estimated average useful life of the technology  years 
we also capitalize certain costs related to patent applications 
accumulated costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the patent  which is generally years and usually commences at the time the patent application is filed 
costs related to patent applications are written off to expense at the time such costs are deemed to have no continuing value 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
we review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the total amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
loss of legal ownership or rights to patents or licensed technology  or significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  among other things  could give rise to asset impairment 
deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance reduces the gross deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable 
we considered projections of future taxable income  past operating results and tax planning strategies in making this determination 
clinical trial expenses 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and amortizing this total cost for the patient over the estimated treatment period  beginning when the patient enrolls in the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including lab costs  related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  the method of administration of the treatment  and the length of treatment period for each patient 
treatment periods vary depending on the clinical trial 
as actual costs become known to us  we may need to make a material change in our estimated accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
accruals for potential disallowed costs on contracts 
we have contracts with agencies of the us government under which we bill for direct and indirect costs incurred 
these billed costs are subject to audit by government agencies 
we have established accruals to provide for potential disallowed costs 
in the event that the final costs allowed are lower than we have estimated  we may need to make a material change in our estimated accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations and cash flow 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from licensing access to our proprietary technology  and by performing services under research and development contracts and service contracts 
as more fully explained in note of the notes to financial statements  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain payments under our collaborative agreements 
in general  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determined  and collection is reasonably assured 
any initial license or option payment received under an agreement under which we also provide research and development services is recognized as revenue over the term of the research and development period 
payments for options on a license to our technology are recognized as revenue over the option period 
fees paid to extend an option are recognized as revenue over the option extension period 
upfront license payments are recognized as revenue upon contract signing if the fee is nonrefundable and noncreditable  and if there are no significant performance obligations remaining 
revenue from milestones is recognized as the milestones are achieved and collection of payment is reasonably assured 
revenue under research and development contracts and manufacturing service contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
we do not recognize revenue on contract change orders until the service is performed and we have a signed modification for additional funding for the contract 
prior to that time  any costs incurred for change orders on contracts are deferred if it is probable that we will receive a signed modification increasing the funding under the contract which will allow us to recover the costs incurred 
once the signed modification for additional funding is received  the deferred costs and any related revenue are both recognized 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue on the balance sheets 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business  as previously defined in that opinion 
we implemented sfas no 
in the first quarter of implementation did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements including rescinding sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as extraordinary items  net of related income tax effect  and amending sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   although early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of sfas no 
is encouraged 
we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
will affect only the timing of the recognition of future restructuring costs 
this statement is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in october  the fasb revised the approach for emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting under arrangements where a company will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on when and how an arrangement should be divided into a separate unit of accounting  and when and how much revenue can be recognized on the different units delivered in particular to license  research and development and contract manufacturing agreements often entered into by companies in the biotechnology industry 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin would require us to record as a liability in our balance sheet any guarantees upon the issuance of such guarantee or indemnification 
additionally  fin requires disclosures about such guarantees 
the initial recognition and initial measurement of guarantees is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions are applicable for financial statements for interim or annual periods ended after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
by providing alternative methods for transition to companies who voluntarily change to the fair value method of accounting for stock options 
additionally  the statement requires expanded and more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements of the method used to account for stock options and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have provided the required disclosure in note of the notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
at december   no investments in equity securities are made in our investment portfolio which consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of december   percent of the investments would mature within one year  and an additional percent and percent would mature within two and three years  respectively 
the average maturity was nine months 
our investments are all classified as available for sale securities 
to assess our interest rate risk  we performed a sensitivity analysis projecting an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using the following assumptions a twelve month time horizon  a nine month average maturity and a basis point increase in interest rates 
this pro forma fair value would have been million lower than the reported fair value of our investments at december  our rate of return on investments  excluding realized gains on sales of investments  has decreased as the federal reserve board has lowered interest rates 
some of our investments were purchased prior to the reductions  and are currently yielding higher returns than we could expect when reinvesting the proceeds upon sale or maturity 
thus  our interest yields are expected to be lower in the lower investment yields and lower investment balances are expected to result in lower investment income in
