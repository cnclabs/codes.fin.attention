payments to us from our subsidiary  spell c  are subject to a number of restrictions under the amended target agreement 
we cannot assure you that our subsidiary  spell c  will continue to distribute any significant amount of cash or property to us until after the maturity of the secured notes  if then 
the secured notes indenture provides that any royalties payable under the amended target agreement will be deposited directly into a collection account controlled by the trustee under the secured notes indenture 
the trustee will distribute from the collection account the amount of principal due and payable to the holders on the secured notes on quarterly note payment dates 
excess amounts in the collection account may only be distributed to spell c if the amount in the collection account exceeds the aggregate amount of principal due and payable on the next quarterly note payment date 
such excess amounts may then be distributed by spell c to us 
the aggregate scheduled amortization under the secured notes is million and equals the aggregate minimum guaranteed royalty payable under the amended target agreement  which is also million 
see recapitalization  sale of cherokee trademarks to spell c  issuance of secured notes and united states retail direct licensing 
there is no assurance that in 
table of contents the future there will be any excess amounts available to be distributed to us 
we do not expect revenues deposited in the collateral account from sources other than the amended target agreement to be significant during fiscal year we cannot predict with accuracy whether payments under the amended target agreement will exceed the minimum guaranteed royalty  and if they do not  no distribution will be made to spell c from the collateral account  and in turn  spell c will have no funds available to distribute to us 
if spell c does not distribute any funds to us during the balance of the initial term of the amended target agreement it could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our business is subject to intense competition 
royalties paid to us under our licensing agreements are generally based on a percentage of our licensee s net sales of licensed products 
cherokee and sideout brand footwear  apparel  and accessories  which are manufactured and sold by both domestic and international wholesalers and retail licensees  are subject to extensive competition by numerous domestic and foreign companies 
such competitors with respect to the cherokee brand include levi strauss co  the gap  old navy  liz claiborne and vf corp 
and private labels  such as faded glory  arizona and route  developed by retailers 
competitors with respect to the sideout brand include quicksilver  mossimo  nike and other active wear companies 
factors which shape the competitive environment include quality of garment construction and design  brand name  style and color selection  price and the manufacturer s ability to respond quickly to the retailer on a national basis 
in recognition of the increasing trend towards consolidation of retailers and greater emphasis by retailers on the manufacture of private label merchandise  in the united states our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers for their sale of products bearing our brands through the licensing of our trademarks directly to retailers 
therefore  our success is dependent on our licensees ability to design  manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and to respond to ever changing consumer demands  and any significant failure by our licensees to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
other companies owning established trademarks could also enter into similar arrangements with retailers 
see competition 
our business is dependent on target stores  which accounted for of our consolidated licensing revenues in fiscal during fiscal  of our and spell c s licensing revenues were generated from a single source  target stores  a division of target corp 
see united states retail direct licensing 
the term of the amended target agreement currently extends until january  and  unless target stores gives us one year s advance notice of its intention to terminate the agreement  the agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive one year terms provided that target stores has paid a minimum guaranteed royalty equal to or greater than million for the preceding fiscal year 
see united states licensing 
if target stores elects to terminate the agreement  effective january  or at any other time  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no guarantee that we would be able to replace the target stores royalty payments from other sources 
the amended target agreement  however  requires one year s advance notice of termination by target stores to prevent automatic renewal  during which period we believe we could enter into one or more licensing agreements for the cherokee brand with either retailers and or wholesalers  which we expect would enable us to replace some of the lost revenues from target stores 
we have assigned all our rights in the amended target agreement to spell c  which has in turn pledged the amended target agreement as collateral for the secured notes 
spell c will be dependent on revenues from the amended target agreement for most  if not all  of its revenues 
although the amended target agreement provides for minimum annual royalty payments  if for any reason target stores does not pay the minimum royalties while the secured notes remain outstanding  spell c will likely be unable to meet  and will default on  its payment obligations under the indenture for the secured notes 
we are not guarantors of the secured notes  however  the united states cherokee trademarks have been pledged as security for the secured notes  and the 
table of contents permanent loss of such trademarks as a result of a default would have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the secured notes mature february  we are dependent on our intellectual property and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully protect our rights 
we and spell c hold various trademarks including cherokee  sideout  king of the beach and others in connection with apparel  footwear and accessories 
these trademarks are vital to the success and future growth of our business 
these trademarks are registered with the united states patent and trademark office and in several other countries 
we and spell c also hold several trademark applications for cherokee  sideout  and king of the beach in several countries 
we monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized filings of our trademarks  and we rely primarily upon a combination of trademark  know how  trade secrets  and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that such measures afford only limited protection and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the actions taken by us to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will prevent imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others  or prevent the loss of licensing revenue or other damages caused thereby 
in addition  the laws of several countries in which we have licensed our intellectual property may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property  which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in the future we may be required to assert infringement claims against third parties  and there can be no assurance that one or more parties will not assert infringement claims against us 
while we currently have the resources to pursue or defend most infringement claims  any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our management personnel whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor 
mossimo inc has refused to make payment under the finder s agreement and we have made no reserves with respect to withheld payments 
during fiscal  we assisted mossimo inc in locating target stores as a licensee of the mossimo brand and entered into a finder s agreement with mossimo  which provides that we will receive of all monies paid to mossimo by target stores 
under mossimo s agreement with target stores  target stores is obligated to pay mossimo a royalty based on a percentage of net sales of mossimo branded products  with a minimum guaranteed royalty 
in february  the agreement between mossimo and target was renewed until january   but continues to contain early termination provisions 
during fiscal  revenues from mossimo were million 
however  mossimo refused to pay the million in finder s fees during fiscal an arbitration was heard between the parties in mid october on this matter 
an arbitration panel ruled in favor of cherokee on november   issuing an interim arbitration award directing mossimo to pay all monies owed cherokee plus interest on any of the monies withheld  along with legal fees 
the arbitrators also reaffirmed the finder s agreement 
this interim award was reaffirmed in total in a final award on january  cherokee is moving to confirm the final arbitration ruling in the superior court of los angeles county  however mossimo has filed a petition to vacate the award 
if the court confirms the award  it is not clear whether mossimo will contest this matter further 
mossimo has set aside the awarded amounts due to cherokee in a separate cash account pending a final judgment 
if mossimo continues to pursue further legal remedies and there is a material delay in the confirmation of the award  or for any other reason there is a delay in the payment by mossimo of the past due fees that have been withheld  or future fees  it could have a material adverse effect on cherokee s cash flow and liquidity 
if cherokee is ultimately not successful in having the award confirmed  and mossimo does not pay either the fees it has withheld or future fees  then it could have a material adverse effect on cherokee s business  prospects  financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
furthermore  we have made no provision for reserves against the accounts receivable outstanding from mossimo  and if we ultimately do not receive the money from mossimo we would be required to write off these accounts receivable
