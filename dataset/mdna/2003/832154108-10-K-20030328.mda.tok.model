item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements in this report  including statements regarding the company s strategy  financial performance and revenue sources  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbors created by that act and those sections 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and entail numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements 
the company s actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of those factors set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by the company in this report and in the company s other reports filed with the sec that attempt to advise interested parties of certain risks factors that may affect the company s business 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements contained in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in its business or as new information becomes available 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software revenue is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sop provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized for licensing  selling  leasing or otherwise marketing computer software 
we generally recognize revenues from sales of our software as completed products are shipped and title passes and from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  assuming collectibility is reasonably assured 
returns from oem customers are generally limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
we may permit retail customers to return or exchange product and may provide price protection on products unsold by a customer 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns and other concessions to the extent that such returns are estimable and certain other conditions are met 
such reserves are based upon management s evaluation of historical experience  current industry trends and estimated costs 
while returns and other concessions have historically been within management s estimates  the amount of estimated reserves could change as new information becomes available 
in july of  we signed a new distribution agreement with our primary distributor 
as a result of the negotiation of sales return and collection terms in a new distribution agreement  revenue from distributors is now recognized upon sell through to the end customer  rather than upon shipment to the distributor 
the related impact during the third quarter of was to defer recognition of sales to distributors and increase reserves for inventory 
table of contents currently in the channel  totaling approximately  we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
we recognize consulting services and hosting revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
sales incentives in the emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s product 
effective january   we adopted eitf pursuant to eitf  the cost of sales incentives we offer without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction  is required to be accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to comply with the revised income statement display requirements for comparative purposes 
the result of this adoption was a reduction in revenue with a corresponding reduction in selling and marketing expense of  million and  in the three years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for estimated credit losses  and those losses have historically been within our expectations 
we cannot  however  guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for product returns are included in other adjustments to accounts receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
superseded sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of long lived assets to determine whether or not an impairment to such value has occurred 
we have determined that there was no impairment at december  goodwill sfas no 
 which was adopted on january   requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down when impaired 
sfas no 
also requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
in accordance with this standard  we no longer amortize goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but evaluates their carrying value at least on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
we ceased amortizing goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 we were required to perform a two step transitional impairment review 
the first step of this review was completed by june  with the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in order to identify whether the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in the event that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the second step of the test would be required to determine if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at transition on january  or at december  we had no indefinite life intangibles as of january  if estimates change  a materially different impairment conclusion could result 
in accordance with this pronouncement  effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
for comparison  goodwill amortization expense was  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   the amount of goodwill allocated to the products reporting segment is  the amount of goodwill allocated to the services reporting segment is

net revenues from sales of products were million and million for and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or from to product revenues accounted for of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in net product revenues from to was primarily the result of the reduction of sales through the retail distribution channel 
as a result of this continued erosion of retail distribution economics  during we have significantly reduced distribution channel inventory through a combination of sell through and lowering of restocking levels 
additionally  we began recording retail revenue only upon distribution channel sell through  rather than upon shipment pursuant to the negotiation of a new distributor agreement  which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately  compared to we operate with little backlog because we generally ship our software products as we receive orders and because our royalty revenue is based upon our customers actual usage in a given period 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders that we book and ship in that quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to predict future revenues and trends

we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent periods 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all

 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the use of the pooling of interest method for business combinations initiated after june  and also applies to all business combinations accounted for by the purchase method that are completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 which was adopted on january   requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually and written down when impaired 
sfas no 
also requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
in accordance with this standard  we no longer amortize goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets but evaluates their carrying value at least on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired 
we ceased amortizing goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 we were required to 
table of contents perform a two step transitional impairment review 
the first step of this review was completed by june  with the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in order to identify whether the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in the event that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  the second step of the test would be required to determine if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at transition on january  or at december  we had no indefinite life intangibles as of january  if estimates change  a materially different impairment conclusion could result 
in accordance with this pronouncement  effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
for comparison  goodwill amortization expense was  and  in the years ended december  and december   respectively

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we believe that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations because we have no variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are required to follow the prescribed disclosure format and have provided the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
for the year ended december  see notes and and must also provide the disclosures in our quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ending march  in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents risk factors before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  that could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers  including our largest distributor  the size and timing of any return product requests for our products  our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  general economic and market conditions  variations in our sales channels or the mix of our product sales  the gain or loss of a key customer  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  the effect of new and emerging technologies  deferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements or operating systems  and the continued success of our cost cutting measures 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  depreciation  amortization  and capital lease expenditures  is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we probably would not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
if we are unable to comply with nasdaq s continued listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq 
in june  our common stock failed to meet the minimum bid price of per share for consecutive days  which caused our stock price to fail to meet one of the minimum standards required by nasdaq for continued listing as a nasdaq national market security 
on july   we announced that we had voluntarily submitted an application to nasdaq to transfer from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
our application has been approved and we became a smallcap market company effective august  this change increased the grace 
table of contents period available for smallcap companies that comply with the core initial listing standards of the smallcap market that is  either net income of  stockholders equity of million or market capitalization of million 
if our stock cannot maintain trading at prices over or we cannot meet any subsequent grace period requirements  we may become subject to the delisting process 
there can be no assurance that we will satisfy all requirements for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we are unable to meet the continued listing requirements in the future  our common stock will be subject to delisting  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity currently available to our stockholders 
in order to meet nasdaq s continued minimum trading price requirement and remain listed  we may have to request shareholder approval to execute a reverse split for our common stock 
the effect of a reverse split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty and it is possible that the per share price of our common stock after the reverse split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding resulting from the reverse stock split 
there can be no assurance that the market price per post reverse split share will either exceed or remain in excess of the minimum bid price for any sustained period of time 
the market price of our common stock may be based also on other factors that may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding  including our future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not be delisted due to a failure to meet other continued listing requirements even if the market price per post reverse split share of our common stock remains in excess of 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our market  which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our revenues 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands  keep up with evolving industry standards  including changes in the microsoft operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible  and to promote those products successfully 
the communications and utilities software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers 
if our software markets do not develop as we anticipate or our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets  or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future operating systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
we operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology 
microsoft corporation poses a significant competitive threat to us because microsoft operating systems  windows xp  windows me  windows  windows  windows and windows nt  may include some capabilities now provided by certain of our oem and retail software products 
if users are satisfied relying on the capabilities of windows xp  windows me  windows  windows  windows  windows nt or other operating systems  sales of our products are likely to decline 
in addition  our principal fax related retail products  hotfax messagecenter and hotfax  currently compete directly with symantec s winfax pro 
in addition  because there are low barriers to entry into the software market  we expect significant competition from other established and emerging software companies in the future 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential oem customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products 
microsoft and many of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  
table of contents marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
there is also a substantial risk that announcements of competing products by large competitors such as microsoft and symantec could result in the cancellation of orders by retailers  distributors or other customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products 
in addition  some of our competitors  such as symantec  currently make complementary products that are sold separately 
such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated  cost effective software applications 
some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer oem products with a reduced set of features 
the opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make oem products available at their own cost or even at a loss 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations  which may lead to the creation of additional large and well financed competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
we maintain relationships with multiple distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products 
loss of a distributor  retailer or unanticipated retail product returns could have a negative impact on our revenues 
in addition to our direct sales efforts including our web store  we depend on distributors and retailers to sell our retail software products 
our relationships with these distributors and retailers depend upon a number of factors  including sales volume 
our agreements with distributors and retailers are not exclusive and may be terminated by either party without cause 
distributors or retailers may purchase fewer products from us or return product to us in any given quarter with little or no advanced notice to us for reasons beyond our control such as a change in their inventory strategies 
although we do not recognize revenue until our product is sold through the channel  if any of these events were to occur  our future retail sales would be adversely affected 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our current operations to suffer 
we have in the past made and we expect to continue to consider acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we make any additional acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from our company s day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition 
we may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition related accounting costs and write offs 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies within existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  market conditions within our retail and oem software markets  
table of contents general global economic and political instability  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
our products may contain undetected software errors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected errors 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these errors 
although we and our oem customers test our products  it is possible that errors may be found in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products 
these undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance of our products or claims against us by customers 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  in order to meet our capital needs 
additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us to allow us to meet our capital needs 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing to fund our activities 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish right to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we currently have no established line of credit or other business borrowing facility in place 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents marketing efforts for our retail software products require substantial investments that may adversely affect our operating margins 
maintaining product distribution channels for our retail software products requires significant investments in marketing and sales related to these products 
we expect to continue to minimize these costs in the future 
accordingly  our retail sales may not provide us with the revenue levels that we have historically achieved 
inability or delays in deliveries from our component suppliers could damage our reputation and could cause our net revenues to decline and harm our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with the components for our product kits 
these components include cds and printed manuals 
we also rely on third parties for cd rom replication 
we do not have long term supply arrangements with any vendor to obtain these necessary components for our products 
if we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers or if the cd rom replication facilities that we use do not deliver our requirements on schedule  we may not be able to deliver products in a cd rom format to our customers on a timely basis or enter into new orders because of a shortage in components 
any delays that we experience in delivering our products to customers could impair our customer relationships and adversely impact our reputation and our business 
in addition  if our third party suppliers raise their prices for components or cd rom replication services  our gross margins would be reduced 
because we currently operate with little or no backlog  our ability to predict our revenues and operating results is extremely limited 
we operate with little backlog because we generally ship our software products as we receive orders and because our royalty revenue is based upon our customers actual usage in a given period 
accordingly  we recognize revenue shortly after orders are received or royalty reports are generated 
as a result  our sales in any quarter are dependent on orders that we book and ship in that quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to predict what our revenues and operating results will be in any quarter 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  which could negatively impact our revenues 
our success is dependent upon our software code base  our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright and trademark law 
however  these measures afford us only limited protection 
we currently own united states trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks  but we have not yet obtained registrations for all of our trademarks in the united states or other countries 
in addition  prior to becoming a publicly held entity  we did not require our employees to sign proprietary information and inventions agreements stipulating to our software ownership rights 
we only recently started the patent application process for a number of technologies relating to our existing products and products under development 
furthermore  we rely primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
accordingly  despite the precautions we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks  patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features  content  or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties 
we have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our fax products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim 
table of contents infringement by us with respect to our current or future products 
infringement claims  whether with or without merit  could result in time consuming and costly litigation  divert the attention of our management  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical and consulting personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of our key employees would likely materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our communication software products as well those in our highly specialized consulting business 
competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry 
our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development  consulting services  marketing  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue  develop new products or product enhancements and generally have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  retaining key employees during restructuring efforts is critical to company success 
if commerce conducted over the internet grows more slowly than in the past  our future sales and future profits may decline 
if ebusiness does not continue to grow or grows more slowly than in the past  demand for certain of our products and services will be reduced 
certain of our products  including webdna  enhance companies abilities to transact business and conduct web based operations 
as a result  future sales and any future profits from those products are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by consumers and businesses 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december    and  respectively  were derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in the future  we may expand these international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including general political  social and economic conditions causing instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 

table of contents our officers and directors could control matters submitted to our stockholders and affect the outcome of any vote 
as of march   william w 
smith jr  the president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of our company  and rhonda l 
smith  the secretary  treasurer and vice chairman of the board of our company  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
william w 
smith jr 
and rhonda l 
smith are married to one another and  acting together  will have the ability to elect our directors and determine the outcome of any corporate action requiring stockholder approval  including a sale of the company  irrespective of how other stockholders may vote 
this concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making an offer to buy our company  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of our common stock could cause the price of our shares to decline 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
of this amount  the  shares held by william w 
smith  jr 
and rhonda l 
smith are available for sale in the public market subject to the volume and other applicable restrictions of rule 
overall  our trading volume fluctuates widely and at times is relatively limited 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by william w 
smith  jr  rhonda l 
smith or any other person  including through any directed selling plan  either individually or when aggregated with sales by other persons  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could make a takeover of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for instance  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of shares of any series of preferred stock  without action by our stockholders 
as a result  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  which could delay or prevent a change of control because the rights given to the holders of such preferred stock may prohibit a merger  reorganization  sale or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
