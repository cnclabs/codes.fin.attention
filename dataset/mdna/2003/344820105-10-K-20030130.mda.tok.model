item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over periods from to years 
the carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the acquired business over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
where such estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  a potential impairment exists 
we are required to adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets beginning november  this statement requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and it requires instead that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill were determined to be greater than its estimated fair value under the impairment test  then it would be written down to its estimated fair value 
the discontinuance of goodwill amortization is not expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations 
we have not completed a transitional impairment test  as required by sfas no 
patronage dividends as a stockholder of wakefern  the company earns a share of wakefern s earnings  which is distributed as a patronage dividend 
this dividend is based on a distribution of wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year  which ends the saturday closest to september  in proportion to the dollar volume of business done by each member of wakefern during that fiscal year 
patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the company accrues estimated patronage dividends due from wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of the company s share of this annual dividend based on the company s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with wakefern that year 
these estimates are based on both historical patronage dividend percentages and the current volume of merchandise purchased from wakefern 
workers compensation insurance from june  to may  we maintained workers compensation insurance with various carriers on a retrospective basis where claims within certain limits remain the responsibility of the company 
we have established reserve amounts based upon our evaluation of the status of claims still open as of november  and loss development factors used by the insurance industry 
as of november   the worker s compensation reserve totaled approximately  such reserve amount is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our eventual workers compensation obligations will not exceed the amount of the reserve 
however  we believe that any difference between the amount recorded for our estimated liability and the costs of settling the actual claims would not be material to the results of operations

working capital at november   november  and october   the company had working capital deficiencies of   and  respectively 
the company normally requires small amounts of working capital since inventory is generally sold at approximately the same time that payments to wakefern and other suppliers are due and most sales are for cash or cash equivalents 
working capital improved in fiscal primarily as the result of the increase in receivables and other current assets 
this increase relates primarily to receivables due from landlords for construction allowances for the woodbridge and ewing  new jersey locations 
a portion of these receivables is currently in dispute as a result of litigation with the landlord over the correct commencement date of the lease for the new woodbridge location 
the company denies the landlord s allegations  and the amount and timing of collection of the construction allowances will depend upon the outcome of the litigation 
when collected  the proceeds from these receivables will be used to reduce the revolving note which is classified as long term borrowings 
this will result in a corresponding decrease in working capital 
the balance of accounts receivables consist primarily of returned checks due the company  coupon receivables  third party pharmacy insurance claims and organization charge accounts 
the terms of most receivables are days or less 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is large in comparison to the amount of accounts receivable because the allowance consists primarily of a reserve for returned checks which are not written off until all collection efforts are exhausted
