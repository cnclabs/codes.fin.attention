item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
also see forward looking statements discussion 
introduction we are a national provider of comprehensive heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
we operate primarily in the commercial and industrial hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
the segment of the hvac industry we serve can be broadly divided into two service functions installation in newly constructed facilities  which provided approximately of our revenues in  and maintenance  repair and replacement  which provided the remaining of our revenues 
our company was originally formed in through an initial public offering  or ipo  and simultaneous acquisition of companies engaged in our business 
from the time we completed our ipo through december  we acquired hvac and complementary businesses  of which were tuck in operations that were integrated with our existing operations 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we shifted our strategy from an acquisition based growth strategy to an operating strategy that increased emphasis on improving our operating performance 
since then  we have sold or ceased operations at locations through december  significantly  on march   we sold operations to emcor group  inc for million  including emcor s assumption of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
these operations provided million and million of our revenue in and  respectively 
we used the proceeds from this sale to reduce debt 
the operating results of companies sold to emcor have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we recognized a loss of million and a goodwill impairment charge prior to the sale of million  net of taxes  related to the sold operations 
for a further discussion of this sale  see item financial statements and supplemental data notes and in response to the securities and exchange commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified our critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our most critical accounting policy is our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities and the assessment of goodwill impairment 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting under the percentage of completion method of accounting as provided by american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in which we engage in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials net of estimated rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure such costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
as a result  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
an added complexity to the percentage of completion method of accounting is that changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments  and we recognize these revisions in the period in which they are determined 
if such revisions lead us to conclude that we will recognize a loss on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period we reach that conclusion  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
depending on the size of a project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer  the ongoing relationships with our customers  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to our contract 
the estimate of the allowance is based upon the best facts available and estimates are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
accounting for self insurance liabilities we are self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims resulting from uninsured deductibles per accident or occurrence 
losses up to the deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of these obligations 
we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new standard has two effects 
first  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill against our operating results on a recurring basis 
second  we are required to regularly test the goodwill on our books to determine whether its value has been impaired  and if it has  immediately write off  as a component of operating income  the amount of the goodwill that is impaired 
more specifically  we are required to assess our goodwill asset amounts for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessments 
as part of the adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to make a one time determination of any transitional impairment loss by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology 
the result of this transitional analysis was a million charge net of taxes reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of we recorded an additional impairment charge of million as a component of operating results during the fourth quarter of results of operations year ended december  in thousands revenues    cost of services    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses    goodwill amortization and impairment   restructuring charges   operating income loss    other expense  net    reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net  income loss before income taxes    income tax expense benefit    income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations operating results  net of tax   estimated loss on disposition  including tax  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  net income loss    compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decline in revenues was comprised of a decline in revenues at ongoing operations and a decline in revenues related to operations that were sold or shut down during the decline in revenues at ongoing operations in resulted primarily from the lagged effect of the general economic slowdown that began in this slowdown led to widespread delays in facility owners decisions to proceed on both new and replacement projects  and has also resulted in a more competitive pricing environment 
the decline in revenue is also consistent with management s decreased emphasis on revenue growth in favor of improvement in profit margins  operating efficiency  and cash flow 
there can be no assurance  however  that this strategy will lead to improved profit margins in the near term 
in view of these factors  particularly the decreased economic activity and increased price competition affecting our industry  we may continue to experience only modest revenue growth or revenue declines in upcoming periods 
in addition  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  we may realize further decreases in revenue and lower operating margins 
backlog primarily contains installation and replacement project work  and maintenance agreements 
these projects generally last less than a year 
service work and short duration projects are generally billed as performed and therefore do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million  a increase from december  backlog of million 
during the fourth quarter  we removed million from backlog that related to a project that we now believe will not proceed 
this project was first reflected in backlog in the third quarter of if this project is excluded from all applicable periods  our backlog reflected an increase of from an adjusted december  backlog of million 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in the decline in gross profit for the year as a whole is primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment as a result of the general economic slowdown which began in this slowdown also resulted in project delays at a number of our operations as decisions to start new construction activities as well as retrofit projects were delayed in the fourth quarter of these delays significantly affected our revenue volume and profitability during the first part of in the fourth quarter of  we began experiencing cost overruns in certain operations as well as reduced activity levels in connection with renewed uncertainty about the economy and international events 
these developments continued into the first quarter of we also undertook restructuring steps at our energy efficiency and national account operations in the first quarter of with the occurrence of these developments during what is traditionally a period of reduced seasonal activity  we expect we will report a net loss for the first quarter of that is comparable to the net loss from continuing operations that we reported in the first quarter of we do expect to be profitable in the second quarter and for as a whole 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in during the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded bad debt expense of approximately million related to our receivables with kmart  in light of that company s bankruptcy filing in january during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the bad debt reserves that were established in the fourth quarter of related to the kmart receivables as a result of a settlement with kmart 
excluding the kmart charge in and reversal in  sg a declined million  or  to million  and as a percentage of revenue  from in to in the decrease in sg a is primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout our company 
this effort included a reduction in corporate overhead at the end of the first quarter of in response to our smaller size following the sale of units to emcor as discussed further below under discontinued operations 
nonrecurring costs associated with this particular reduction were reflected as restructuring charges in march sg a as a percentage of revenues for periods prior to the emcor transaction is higher than historical levels because the financial statements do not allocate any corporate overhead to the discontinued operations 
as a result  sg a for continuing operations in those periods includes substantially the full amount of corporate office overhead that was in place to support our larger size prior to the sale of operations to emcor 
goodwill amortization and impairment as discussed above  we no longer amortize goodwill via regular charges to our income statement due to our adoption of sfas see cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for further discussion 
we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of restructuring charges during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs primarily associated with the reduction in corporate overhead in light of our smaller size following the emcor transaction 
the severance costs related to the termination of employees  all of whom were terminated as of march  in addition  these charges include approximately million for costs associated with decisions to merge or close three smaller divisions and realign regional operating management 
these restructuring charges are primarily cash obligations but did include approximately million of non cash writedowns associated with long lived assets 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to contractual severance obligations of two operating presidents in connection with our significant restructuring program in the second half of these restructuring charges are net of a gain of approximately million related to management s decision to sell a small operation during the first quarter of other expense  net other expense  net  primarily includes interest expense  and decreased million  or  to million in compared to a portion of our actual interest expense in both years has been allocated to the discontinued operations caption based upon our net investment in these operations 
therefore  interest expense relating to continuing operations does not reflect the pro forma reduction of interest expense from applying the proceeds from the sale of these operations to reduce debt in any earlier period 
interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations in and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  first quarter interest expense in continuing operations includes a non cash writedown of million  before taxes  of loan arrangement costs in connection with the reduction in our borrowing capacity following the emcor transaction 
other expense  net  for the second quarter of also includes a gain of million on the sale of the residential portion of one of our operations 
in addition  a gain of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the extinguishment of subordinated debt which was partially offset by the acceleration of the amortization of deferred debt costs of million in october when we replaced our existing credit facility 
income tax expense our effective tax rates associated with results from continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
effective january   our effective tax rate no longer reflects a permanent difference between book income and tax income for goodwill amortization that is not deductible for tax purposes 
discontinued operations on march   we sold operations to emcor group 
the total purchase price was million  including the assumption by emcor of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
the transaction with emcor provided for a post closing adjustment based on a final accounting  done after the closing of the transaction  of the net assets of the operations that were sold to emcor 
that accounting indicated that the net assets transferred to emcor were approximately million greater than a target amount that had been agreed to with emcor 
in the second quarter of  emcor paid us that amount  and released million that had been escrowed in connection with this element of the transaction 
of emcor s purchase price  million was deposited into an escrow account to secure potential obligations on our part to indemnify emcor for future claims and contingencies arising from events and circumstances prior to closing  all as specified in the transaction documents 
of this escrow  million has been applied in determining the company s liability to emcor in connection with the settlement of certain claims as described subsequently in this section 
the remaining million of escrow is available for book purposes to apply to any future claims and contingencies in connection with this transaction  and has not been recognized as part of the emcor transaction purchase price 
the net cash proceeds of approximately million received to date from the emcor transaction have been used to reduce our debt 
we paid million of federal taxes related to this transaction in march in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge of million  net of tax benefits of million  in estimated loss on disposition  including tax in our results of operations in connection with the emcor transaction 
this charge primarily relates to a preliminary agreement to settle claims from emcor for reimbursement of impaired assets and additional liabilities associated with the operations acquired from us 
under this settlement  we also agreed to partially reimburse emcor for any loss on the eventual resolution of certain claims involving a project at one of the operations emcor acquired from us  and we were released from liability on all other outstanding receivables and issues relating to the profitability of projects that were in process at the time emcor acquired these operations from us 
the settlement agreement also includes the use of million of the million escrow described above to fund settled claims 
we further estimated that an additional million of the remaining escrow would be applied against elements of the settlement that will not be fully resolved until a later date  principally the one open project referred to above 
accordingly  for book purposes  million of escrow remains available to apply against future claims that may arise from emcor in connection with this transaction 
we recorded a tax benefit of million related to this additional charge 
in addition  the million charge recognized during the fourth quarter is also net of a tax credit of million as a result of lower final tax liabilities in connection with the overall emcor transaction than we originally estimated in the first quarter 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which took effect for us on january   the operating results of the companies sold to emcor for all periods presented through the sale  as well as the loss on the sale of these operations  have been presented as discontinued operations in our results of operations 
we realized a total loss of million  including related tax expense  in connection with the sale of these operations 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to these operations of million  net of taxes  as of january  the reporting of our aggregate initial goodwill impairment charge in connection with adopting sfas no 
is discussed further below under cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in march  we also decided to divest of an additional operating company 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an estimated loss of million from this planned disposition in estimated loss on disposition  including tax in our results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed this estimated loss because we decided not to sell this unit 
during the second quarter of  we sold a division of one of our operations 
the operating loss for this division for the first two quarters of of million  net of taxes  has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax in our results of operations 
we realized a loss of million on the sale of this division 
this loss is included in estimated loss on disposition  including tax during the second quarter of in our results of operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required a transitional assessment of our goodwill assets 
to perform the transitional impairment testing required by sfas no 
under its new  more rigorous impairment criteria  we broke our operations into reporting units  as prescribed by the new standard  and tested each of these reporting units for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions were used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
as provided by sfas no 
 the transitional impairment loss identified by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology upon initial adoption of the standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our results of operations 
the resulting non cash charge was million  net of taxes 
compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decline in revenue for was comprised of a decline in revenues related to operations that were sold or shut down during late or in  which was partially offset by of internal growth 
this low revenue growth resulted in part from a general slowing in the us economy as well as management s decreased emphasis on revenue growth in favor of improvement in profit margins  operating efficiency  and cash flow 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit increased from in to in excluding operations that were sold or shut down during late or in  gross profit decreased million  or  to million and gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in our gross profit margin was hurt by sub par gross profit performance from certain ongoing operations that were undergoing operational and management changes 
the results of these operations generally improved in the second half of as compared to the first half 
the negative effect on gross profit percentages of these operations was offset by the divestiture of certain operations in that performed poorly in and by the improvement in two of our larger operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  to million in as compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in excluding operations that were sold or shut down during late or in  sg a increased million  or  to million in compared to and sg a as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in during the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded bad debt expense of approximately million related to our receivables with kmart  in light of that company s bankruptcy filing in january substantially all of the kmart charge related to our ongoing operations that were not divested 
excluding both the kmart charge as well as operations sold or shut down in late or in  sg a declined million  or  to million  and as a percentage of revenue  from in to in sg a as a percentage of revenues during these periods was higher than historical levels because the financial statements do not allocate any corporate overhead to the discontinued operations sold to emcor  and therefore  sg a does not reflect any potential reductions in corporate costs in response to this major change in our company 
excluding the kmart charge  the decrease in sg a is primarily related to operations that were sold or shut down as well as to a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout our company 
restructuring charges during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to contractual severance obligations of two operating presidents in connection with our significant restructuring program undertaken in the second half of these restructuring charges are net of a gain of approximately million related to management s decision to sell a small operation during the first quarter of as announced in the third quarter of  management performed an extensive review of our operations during the second half of as part of this review  management decided to cease operating at three locations  sell five operations including two smaller satellite operations  and merge two companies into other operations 
as a result of these decisions  we estimated and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily associated with restructuring efforts at certain underperforming operations and our decision to cease our e commerce activities at outbound services  a subsidiary of our company 
the restructuring charges were primarily non cash and included goodwill impairments of approximately million and the writedown of other long lived assets of approximately million 
the remaining restructuring items primarily include severance and lease termination costs 
these restructuring actions were substantially completed in during the third quarter of  we decided to retain one of the operations that was previously held for sale and reversed approximately million of non cash charges related to the anticipated loss on the sale of this operation 
this amount was offset by an additional loss on the sale in late september of the final operation that was identified as part of this restructuring program 
the losses associated with the other operations that were sold were consistent with the amounts recorded as restructuring charges in other expense  net other expense  net  decreased million  or  to million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense as a result of the decline in our average debt levels throughout as compared to a portion of our actual interest expense in both years has been allocated to the discontinued operations caption based upon our net investment in these operations 
therefore  interest expense related to continuing operations does not reflect the pro forma reduction of interest expense from applying the proceeds from the sale of these operations to reduce debt in any earlier periods 
interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations in and was million and million  respectively 
reductions in non operating assets and liabilities  net during  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million primarily related to the impairment of certain non operating assets 
this charge included an impairment of approximately million to our minority investment in two entities associated with the distribution and implementation of high end engineering and design software 
these entities have ceased operations 
this charge also included an impairment of approximately million related to notes receivable from former owners of businesses acquired 
offsetting these items was a gain of approximately million on the reduction of a subordinated note payable to a former owner in connection with the settlement of claims with this former owner 
income tax expense our effective tax rates associated with results from continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
our provision for income taxes differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes net of federal income tax benefit and the non deductibility of the amortization of goodwill attributable to certain acquisitions 
the effective tax rate of for is primarily due to the high level of permanent differences primarily non deductible goodwill amortization as compared to the level of pre tax income from continuing operations 
in  we reported income tax benefit of million on a pre tax loss from continuing operations of million 
this is primarily because of large restructuring related writedowns of non deductible goodwill that contributed to the book loss 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    free cash flow cash provided by operating activities    purchases of property and equipment    proceeds from sales of property and equipment    free cash flow    cash flow cash provided by operating activities less customary capital expenditures plus the proceeds from asset sales is generally called free cash flow 
positive free cash flow represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
for the year ended december   we had positive free cash flow of million as compared to million for the same period in free cash flow in was million 
the and cash flow amounts include the operations we sold to emcor in this sale primarily accounts for the lower cash flow amounts in the proceeds received at the closing of the emcor transaction  the post closing adjustment and related escrow received from emcor  and free cash flow from our operations were all used to reduce our debt 
credit facility our primary current debt financing capacity consists of a million senior credit facility  or the facility  provided by a syndicate of three financial institutions led by general electric capital corporation  or ge 
the facility includes a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility was entered into on october  and replaces our previous revolving credit facility 
the facility consists of two parts a term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the term loan under the facility  or the term loan  is million  which we borrowed upon the closing of the facility on october  the term loan must be repaid in quarterly installments over five years beginning december  the amount of each quarterly installment increases annually 
these scheduled payments are recapped below under amounts outstanding  capacity and maturities 
the facility requires certain prepayments of the term loan 
approximately half of any free cash flow primarily cash from operations less capital expenditures in excess of scheduled principal payments and voluntary prepayments must be used to pay down the term loan 
this requirement is measured annually based on full year results 
we do not have any prepayments of the term loan due as of december  under this requirement primarily as a result of our significant amount of voluntary prepayments of debt during in addition  proceeds in excess of  from any individual asset sales  or in excess of million for a full year s asset sales  must be used to pay down the term loan 
proceeds from asset sales that are less than these individual transaction or annual aggregate levels must also be used to pay down the term loan unless they are reinvested in long term assets within six months of the receipt of such proceeds 
all prepayments under the term loan  whether required or voluntary  are applied to scheduled principal payments in inverse order  ie to the last scheduled principal payment first  followed by the second to last  etc 
all principal payments under the term loan permanently reduce the original million capacity under this portion of the facility 
the facility also includes a three year million revolving credit facility 
under this revolving credit facility  through july  we can borrow up to million  with the difference between actual borrowings and million available for letter of credit issuance up to a maximum of million in letters of credit 
after july   we can borrow up to million under the revolving credit facility  with a maximum of million available for letters of credit 
interest rates and fees we have a choice of two interest rate options for borrowings under the facility 
under one option  the interest rate is determined based on the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime rate of at least of the us s largest banks  as published each business day by the wall street journal 
an additional margin of is then added to the higher of these two rates for borrowings under the revolving loan  while an additional margin of is added to the higher of these two rates for borrowings under the term loan 
under the other interest rate option  borrowings bear interest based on designated rates that are described in various general business media sources as the london interbank offered rate or libor 
revolving loan borrowings using this interest rate option then have added to libor  while term loan borrowings have added to libor 
the rates underlying these interest rate options are floating interest rates determined by the broad financial markets  meaning they can and do move up and down from time to time 
the facility required that we convert these floating interest rate terms on at least half of the term loan to fixed rates for at least a one year term 
in january  we converted million of principal value to a fixed libor based interest rate of for an eighteen month term 
this was done via a transaction known as a swap under which we agreed to pay fixed interest rate payments on million for eighteen months to a bank in exchange for receiving from the bank floating libor interest rate payments on million for the same term 
this transaction is a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
as such  interest expense related to the hedged portion of this debt will be recorded at the fixed rate of in our results of operations 
changes in market interest rates in any given period may increase or decrease the valuation of our obligations to the bank under this swap versus the bank s obligations to us 
such changes in market valuation will be reflected in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss for that period  even though these obligations may not have been terminated and settled in cash during the period 
such adjustments are known as mark to market adjustments 
commitment fees of per annum are payable on the unused portion of the revolving loan 
we also incurred certain financing and professional costs in connection with the arrangement and the closing of the facility 
these costs will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility in the amount of approximately million per quarter 
to the extent prepayments of the term loan are made  we may have to accelerate amortization of these deferred financing and professional costs 
additionally  we expect to charge approximately million of deferred financing costs to interest expense in the first quarter of that were associated with higher levels of capacity under the facility than the current total of million 
in connection with the facility  we granted ge a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock for nominal consideration 
in addition  ge may put  or require us to repurchase  these shares at the higher of market price  appraised price or book value per share  during the fifth and final year of the facility october  to october  this put may be accelerated under certain circumstances including a change of control of our company  full repayments of amounts owing under the facility  or a public offering of shares by us 
this warrant and put are discussed in greater detail in note  stockholders equity  to the consolidated financial statements 
the value of this warrant and put as of the start of the facility of million is reflected as a discount of our obligation under the facility and is being amortized over the term of the facility  as described above 
this warrant and put obligation is also recorded as a liability in the company s balance sheet 
the value of this warrant and put will change over time  principally in response to changes in the market price of our common stock 
the warrant and the put qualify as a derivative for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  such changes in the value of the warrant and put in any given period will be reflected in interest expense for that period  even though the warrant and put may not have been terminated and settled in cash during the period 
such adjustments are known as mark to market adjustments 
the after tax loss related to the warrant s mark to market obligation in was million 
the weighted average interest rate that we currently pay on borrowings under the facility is per annum 
this reflects a combination of borrowings under both interest rate options described above  as well as the swap of floating rates to a fixed rate described above 
this rate does not include amortization of debt financing and arrangement costs  or mark to market adjustments for derivatives 
restrictions and covenants borrowings under the facility are specifically limited by our ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda and by our ratio of ebitda less taxes and capital expenditures to interest expense and scheduled principal payments  also known as the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility s definition of debt for purposes of the ratio of total debt to ebitda includes aggregate letters of credit outstanding less million 
the definition of ebitda under the facility excludes certain items  generally non cash amounts and transactions reported in other income and expense  that are otherwise included in the determination of earnings under generally accepted accounting principles in our financial statements 
as such  ebitda as determined under the facility s definition could be less than ebitda as derived from our financial statements in the future 
the financial covenants under the facility are summarized below 
covenant compliance is measured on a monthly basis 
intra quarter monthly covenants are at either the same or very similar levels to the quarter end covenants shown below 
ebitda amounts are in thousands financial covenants minimum minimum fixed trailing maximum charge minimum months debt to coverage interest for the quarter ending ebitda ebitda ratio coverage actual december   covenant march   june   september   december   march   june   september   december   all quarters thereafter  our trailing twelve months ebitda as of december  as determined under the facility did not comply with the covenant 
our lenders waived this violation 
in addition  based on expectations of reduced operating results  at least through the first quarter of as described above under compared to gross profit  our lenders agreed to reduce our minimum ebitda  leverage and fixed charge covenants for even at these reduced levels  these covenants leave only moderate room for variance based on our recent performance 
if we again violate a covenant under the facility  we may have to negotiate new borrowing terms under the facility or obtain new financing 
while we believe that our levels of debt in comparison to our ebitda would enable us to negotiate new borrowing terms under the facility or to obtain new financing from other sources if necessary  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so 
the facility prohibits us from paying dividends and repurchasing shares  limits annual lease expense and non facility debt  and restricts outlays of cash by us relating to certain investments  acquisitions and subordinate debt 
notes to affiliates and former owners subordinated notes were issued to former owners of certain purchased companies as part of the consideration used to acquire their companies 
as of december   these notes had been paid off 
a gain of approximately million was recognized in related to agreements with former owners for early repayment of certain of these notes  or other settlement of claims 
other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
we may decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term 
typically we are liable to the lessor for the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
some customers require us to post letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
certain of our vendors also require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution 
the letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by the issuer of the letter of credit or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
we have reached a preliminary agreement with our surety and ge to grant the surety a secured interest in assets such as receivables  costs incurred in excess of billings  and equipment related to projects for which bonds are outstanding as collateral for potential obligations under bonds 
as of december   the amount of these assets is approximately million 
we have also posted a million letter of credit as collateral for potential obligations under bonds 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our surety  current market conditions as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that we could easily achieve these alternatives 
accordingly  if we were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  our revenues and profits could decline

the increase in our borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan during the first quarter of primarily results from the payment of a million tax liability relating to the emcor transaction that was due in march the following recaps the future maturities of this debt along with other contractual obligations 
debt maturities in this recap are based on amounts outstanding as of march  while operating lease maturities are based on amounts outstanding as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total revolving loan   term loan       other debt total debt       less discount on facility  total debt  net of discount  operating lease obligations        as of december   we also have million of letter of credit commitments  all of which will expire in outlook as noted above  we have generated positive free cash flow in most recent periods  and we currently have a moderate level of debt 
we anticipate that free cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under the facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we do not have a significant amount of excess borrowing capacity in comparison to expected working capital requirements over the balance of we believe that our levels of debt in comparison to our ebitda and our cash flows would enable us to obtain new financing if necessary  but there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so 
we currently have million in letters of credit outstanding 
we self insure a significant portion of our workers compensation  auto liability and general liability risks 
we use third parties to manage this self insurance and to retain some of these risks 
as is customary under such arrangements  these third parties can require letters of credit as security for amounts they fund or risks they might potentially absorb on our behalf 
under our current self insurance arrangements  we expect that we will be required to post approximately million per quarter during the first three quarters of in addition  we may receive other letter of credit requests in the ordinary course of business  and we may have a net increase in the amount of insurance related letters of credit we must post when we renew our insurance arrangements in the fourth quarter of next year 
accordingly  our letter of credit requirements over the next year may exceed the current letter of credit sublimit of million under our credit facility 
if so  we may have to seek additional letter of credit capacity or post different forms of security such as bonds or cash in lieu of letters of credit 
we believe that our levels of debt in comparison to our ebitda and free cash flows would enable us to obtain additional letter of credit capacity or to otherwise meet financial security requirements of third parties if necessary  but there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so 
as described above  we must comply with a number of financial covenants in connection with the facility 
our trailing twelve months ebitda as of december  as determined under the facility did not comply with covenant 
our lenders waived this violation 
in addition  based on expectations of lower operating results at least through the first quarter of as described above under compared to gross profit  our lenders agreed to modify our minimum ebitda  leverage and fixed charge covenants for even at these modified levels  these covenants leave only moderate room for variance based on our recent performance 
if we again violate a covenant under the facility  we may have to negotiate new borrowing terms under the facility or obtain new financing 
while we believe that our levels of debt in comparison to our ebitda and our cash flows would enable us to negotiate new borrowing terms under the facility or to obtain new financing from other sources if necessary  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months the first quarter of the year due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted this new standard effective january  see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  under sfas no 
 the operating results of companies sold or held for sale meeting certain criteria  as well as any gain or loss on the sale of these operations  are presented as discontinued operations in our statements of operations 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our discontinued operations 
the operating results for companies which were sold or shut down during are presented as continuing operations through the date of disposition 
the adoption of sfas no 
did affect the presentation of discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements  however  it did not have any overall financial impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
opinion no 

applying the provisions of opinion no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual and infrequent and meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
in connection with our new credit facility  we fully amortized million of deferred debt costs and recognized a million gain on the extinguishment of subordinated debt in these amounts are recorded in other expense  net in our results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as restructurings  involuntarily terminating employees  and consolidating facilities initiated after december  the implementation of sfas no 
will not require the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
implementation of the pronouncement will therefore have no impact on our current year financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
it clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the objective of the initial measurement of the liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are effective for us on a prospective basis for guarantees issued after december  although we from time to time guarantee the performance of systems or designs we provide  we currently have no material guarantees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transition for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and was adopted by us for all periods presented 
factors which may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating formerly separate businesses  retention of key management  national or regional declines in non residential construction activity  difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with debt financing or bonding  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems and the use of incorrect estimates for bidding a fixed price contract 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results or cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
our success depends in part on our ability to integrate and further consolidate the companies we have acquired 
these businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of our future results because  among other reasons  our subsidiary operations were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to the acquisition 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our surety  current market conditions as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that we could easily achieve these alternatives 
accordingly  if we were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  our revenues and profits could decline 
the existing senior management at many of our subsidiary operations is generally comprised of former owners who committed to stay with their operations after acquisition 
certain of these individuals have suffered losses in the value of our common stock or have lower incomes than they averaged when they owned their former businesses 
further  former owners generally have noncompetition obligations that expire on the fifth anniversary of their date of acquisition  and thus these obligations expire from july through there is no assurance that we will be able to retain these individuals or find suitable replacements if such individuals leave the company 
the failure to retain or replace such management on a timely basis could negatively impact results from operations at such locations 
key elements of our strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability and cash flow of the individual businesses 
our level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside our control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for our services 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
in addition  we depend on the senior management of the businesses we acquire and regional and corporate management to remain committed to our success 
accordingly  our ability to maintain and increase our productivity and profitability is also affected by our ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet our service requirements  and to retain senior management at the corporate  regional and local level 
our ability to generate positive cash flow at our historical levels in the future could be adversely impacted by a reduction in our billings and collections as a result of a decline in new projects 
the risk associated with a decline in new projects could be further perpetuated by our accelerated billing for our project work because we will continue to incur costs on older projects where payment may have already been received from the customer 
such indebtedness  together with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments  could limit our ability to borrow additional funds 
additionally  failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future 
our failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  the increasing supply of tradable stock  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates as discussed below 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and continues to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
in january  we converted million of our term loan to a fixed rate of for an eighteen month term 
this was done via a transaction known as a swap under which we agree to pay fixed libor based interest rate payments on million for eighteen months to a bank in exchange for receiving from the bank floating libor based interest rate payments on million for the same term 
this transaction is a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment 
we are not exposed to any other significant financial market risks including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risks from the use of derivative financial instruments 
management does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily results from our short term and long term debt with both fixed and floating interest rates 
our debt with fixed interest rates consists of capital leases and various notes payable 
this differs from the exposure for the fiscal year ended december  due to the elimination of convertible subordinated notes and subordinated notes as exposures 
our debt with variable interest rates consists entirely of our facility 
the following table presents principal amounts stated in thousands and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations and their indicated fair market value at december  thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt        average interest rate
