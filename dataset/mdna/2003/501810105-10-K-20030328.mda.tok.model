item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company provides integrated end to end solutions for wireless voice and data communication networks with service offerings to include high level technical consulting  system design and deployment and ongoing operations and maintenance services 
since its inception in  the company has delivered wireless network solutions to more than customers in over countries 
internationally based customers accounted for approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended december  see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about revenues derived from internationally based customers 
in the last several years  the company has made several strategic decisions that have enabled it to focus on its core competency in providing end to end wireless services 
in october  the company disposed of its hardware and software products businesses and  in march  the company sold its telecommunication tower business 
in addition  during the last two years  the company has entered into a number of strategic acquisitions and investments to enhance its wireless capabilities with a particular focus on certain international markets 
the company operates in a highly competitive environment subject to rapid technological change and emergence of new technologies 
historically  the key drivers of changes in the company s wireless services business have been the issuance of new or additional licenses to wireless operators  the introduction of new services or technologies  increases in the number of subscribers served by wireless operators  the increasing complexity of wireless systems in operation  and changes in wireless infrastructure spending and deployment 
the company s primary sources of revenues are from engineering design and system deployment services 
prior to the sale of its tower business in march  tower lease revenues provided an additional source of revenues see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues from services are derived from fixed price and time and materials contracts 
the company recognizes revenues from fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
fixed price revenues as a percentage of total revenues were   and in   and  respectively 
with fixed price contracts  the company recognizes revenue based on the ratio of individual contract costs incurred to date on a project compared with total estimated costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized  as they become known and estimable 
the company recognizes revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
lease revenues from the tower business in and preceding periods are recognized over the term of the related lease 
cost of revenues includes direct compensation and benefits  living and travel expenses  payments to third party subcontractors and consultants  equipment rentals  expendable computer software and equipment  and allocated  or directly attributed  facility and overhead costs identifiable to projects 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation  benefits  office and occupancy  and other costs required for the finance  human resources  information systems  and executive office functions 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and other related expenses required to implement the company s marketing  sales and customer support plans 
trends that have affected or may affect results of operations and financial condition the company has continued to see tightened capital markets  which among other things have contributed to a slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending 
the company s success depends upon continued growth in the design and deployment and optimization of wireless networks 
many wireless carriers are reliant upon the capital markets to obtain funds to finance building and improving their wireless networks 
most vulnerable are the customers that are new licensees and operator carriers who have limited sources of funds from operations or have business plans that are dependent on funding from the capital markets 
the slowdown in wireless telecommunications infrastructure spending caused some of the company s customers or potential customers to slow  postpone or reduce the scope of the deployment of new wireless networks or expansion of existing networks  which has reduced the demand for the company s services 
this industry slowdown is occurring at the same time the company is searching for projects to replace the revenue received from xm satellite  the company s largest client in the xm satellite contract was substantially completed in the first quarter of  and no additional significant revenue is anticipated from this customer in the completion of the xm satellite contract coupled with the industry slowdown caused revenue to decline dramatically in additionally  the need to replace revenue derived from the xm satellite contract and the difficult marketplace has caused gross profit as a percentage of total revenues to decline 
cost reduction measures taken by the company are not sufficient to return the company to profitability without additional growth in revenue 
the company has recently seen renewed customer activity to upgrade or enhance existing systems 
despite this renewed activity  it is difficult to predict the impact  if any  and the related timing of any such impact  upon the company s future revenue growth opportunities 
europe is a promising area for revenue growth for the company 
this optimism is caused by the need of the european carriers to meet network building obligations associated with their g licenses  which represent a significant investment on their part 
with the recent availability of g equipment in europe  the company expects that demand for the types of services provided by the company will increase 
revenue from g networks constituted and of the company s revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and it is expected to continue to be an area of business growth in the future 
in anticipation of this growth  and in order to complement its european radio frequency engineering capacity with local deployment capability necessary to provide end to end services in key european markets  the company has recently acquired additional deployment capability in europe 
in december  the company acquired transmast italia  a wireless infrastructure  deployment  civil engineering and project management firm located in milan  italy 
in january  the company acquired the assets of smith woolley telecom  a telecommunications consultancy company that specializes in the provision of search  acquisition  design  build  and management and maintenance services to the wireless industry in the united kingdom 
in july  the company acquired of detron lcc network services bv  a newly formed company specializing in the provision of deployment  management and maintenance services to the wireless industry in the netherlands 
the company also anticipates that its reliance upon fixed price contracts will continue to grow in connection with these recent acquisitions 
these newly acquired international operations provide more support for network deployment and construction management  where use of fixed price contracts is more typical 
these contracts typically contain payment terms that are less favorable  and consequently require greater working capital than has historically been required by the company  which is reflected as an increase in days sales outstanding 
additionally  the work may provide lower gross profit margins than engineering design services 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as a percentage of revenues from the company s audited consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and the table  and the discussion that follows  provide information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition

a slowdown in a large fixed price contract performed in the middle east contributed to million of the decreased revenues 
revenue declines in the united states of million  largely related to decreased customer spending on broadband and other wireless infrastructure spending also contributed to the decline

the company also sold its investment in tecnosistemi  an italian telecommunications services company in which the company invested in september  resulting in a gain of million in other expense in the prior year was primarily due to losses from using the equity method of accounting for one of the company s investments 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was recorded for the twelve months ended december  using an effective income tax rate of compared to for the comparable period in the higher tax rate in reflects permanent differences relative to the tower portfolio sale

the company s cash position negated the need for any significant financing activity during the twelve months ended december  working capital was million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in working capital in was due to the use of cash to fund acquisitions and operating losses  and the reduction of receivables following the decrease in revenues during the year 
the company has no material cash commitments other than obligations under its operating leases 
future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of payments under contracts and increases in personnel in advance of new contracts 
the company s operating lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands principal payments due less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations the company had no debt and did not maintain a line of credit as of december   since it had cash and short term investments that it considered sufficient to meet liquidity requirements 
the company may consider the limited use of debt facilities in the emea region to support the anticipated growth in working capital for specific projects or entities 
the company has not engaged in any off balance sheet financing as of december  the company believes it has sufficient assets and relationships with financial institutions to obtain appropriate debt facilities should the business need arise 
for the short term  the company believes it has adequate cash and short term investments to satisfy cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company also believes it will generate sufficient cash from operations to meet its long term liquidity needs 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual of expatriate taxes  accounting for income taxes  impairment of investments in affiliates  and restructuring charge 
revenue recognition policy the company s principal source of revenues consists of design and system deployment services 
the company provides design services on a contract basis  usually in a customized plan for each client and generally charges for engineering services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
the company generally offers its deployment services on a fixed price  time certain basis 
the portion of the company s revenue from fixed price contracts was in the company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
with the percentage of completion method  expenses on each project are recognized as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on the ratio of the current costs incurred for the project to the then estimated total costs of the project 
accordingly  revenue recognized in a given period depends on  among other things  the costs incurred on each individual project and its then current estimate of the total remaining costs to complete individual projects 
considerable judgment on the part of the company s management may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of the work to be completed  and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some task s 
if in any period the company significantly increases its estimate of the total costs to complete a project  it may recognize very little or no additional revenue with respect to that project 
if total contract cost estimates increase  gross profit for any single project may be significantly reduced or eliminated 
if the total contract cost estimates indicate that there is a loss  the loss is recognized in the period the determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts and accrual of expatriate taxes the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  the company s management must make estimates of the probability of collection of its accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
for the year ended december   the company derived of its total revenues from its ten largest customers  indicating significant customer concentration risk with the company s receivables 
these ten largest customers constituted of the company s net receivable balance as of december  in addition  fixed price contracts with unfavorable milestone payments can cause unbilled receivables to grow prior to achieving the applicable milestone that permits billing 
at december   the company had approximately million of unbilled receivables  compared to approximately million at december  lastly  the company frequently performs services for development stage customers  which carry a higher degree of risk  particularly as to the collection of accounts receivable 
these customers may be particularly vulnerable to current tightening of available credit and general economic slowdown 
the company estimates liabilities associated with taxes relative to employees sent to assignments in foreign countries 
these expatriate employees are reimbursed for any additional personal income tax burden that was derived as a result of the assignment 
calculation of these obligations takes considerable knowledge of payroll  social  and other taxes in multiple countries  and the employee s personal tax situation 
in addition  it requires interpretation of tax laws  an assessment of potential audit risk from tax authorities  and often the resolution of the tax liabilities may not occur for several years 
the company has million accrued for expatriate tax obligations as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements an estimate for income taxes is required for each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process requires estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which it operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event the actual results differ from these estimates the company may need to increase or decrease its valuation allowance  which could materially have an impact on its financial position and results of operations 
considerable management judgment may be required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred tax assets before they expire 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of foreign net operating losses carried forward  foreign tax credits and non cash compensation accruals relating to stock options issued under a phantom membership plan in effect prior to the company s initial public offering 
the net deferred tax assets  as of december  were million 
impairment of investments in affiliates the company maintained investments in affiliates of million as of december  and none at december  these investments were made in relative to two separate companies  plan design netcare ag million and mobilocity  inc million 
both investments were accounted for at cost 
mobilocity has implemented a voluntary liquidation plan 
plan design netcare ag and its operating subsidiary have filed for insolvency protection 
based upon the voluntary liquidation plans and insolvency filings  the company has determined these investments are probably not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of restructuring charge the company recorded a restructuring charge during the second quarter of and an additional charge during the fourth quarter of included in this restructuring charge of million was a charge for excess facilities aggregating approximately million 
this facility charge significantly relates to leased office space  which the company no longer occupies 
the facility charge takes the existing lease obligation less anticipated rental receipts to be received from existing and potential subleases 
this requires significant judgments about the length of time space will remain vacant  anticipated cost escalators and operating costs associated with the leases  market rate the space will be subleased at  and broker fees or other costs necessary to market the space 
these judgments were based upon independent market analysis and assessment from experienced real estate brokers 
the restructuring charge calculation assumes million will be derived in sublease income  for which the company does not currently have a subtenant

lcc acquired the shares from westminster capital bv westminster 
detron has certain ongoing transactions with westminster 
under a five year lease agreement for office space  detron recorded approximately  of rent expense from the date of acquisition

recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued 
the statement provides specific guidance for the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exiting an activity or disposing of a long lived asset  including restructuring charges that the company currently accounts for under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions are effective after december  the company s adoption of sfas no 
may have an effect on the timing of future restructuring charges taken  if and when they occur 
in december  fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
this statement provides for alternative methods of transition for a company that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also amends the required disclosures relating to employee stock based compensation effective december  at this time  the company does not plan to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for its stock based employee compensation 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also to include more detailed disclosures in respect to those guarantees 
fin is effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified starting january  and requires the additional disclosures for the interim and annual financial statements for periods ending after december  the company does not anticipate issuing any guarantees which would be required to be recognized as a liability under fin and  therefore  the company does not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to its foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in great britain  the netherlands  italy and brazil 
for its foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the us dollar value of their reported earnings and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside the united states for the twelve months ended december   the majority of which were in europe 
in connection with the company s recent acquisitions and the increased availability of g equipment in europe  the company anticipates continued growth of its international operations  particularly in europe  the middle east and africa  in and beyond 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar may have a significant impact on the reported results of the company 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in the company s major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher  respectively 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the us dollar amount of shareholders equity of the company 
the assets and liabilities of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect at december  the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the dollar was stronger relative to many of the foreign currencies at december  compared to december  consequently  the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity increased million during the twelve months ended december  as of december   the total amount of long term intercompany receivable payables in non us subsidiaries subject to this equity adjustment  using the exchange rate as of the same date  was approximately million 
the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations due to the operations of and short term intercompany transactions with its consolidated foreign subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
a hypothetical adverse change would result in a million reduction to operating losses generated outside the united states 
this was estimated using a deterioration factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to net income or loss for each of the subsidiaries in the respective period 
foreign exchange gains and losses recognized on any transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
although currency fluctuations can have an impact on the company s reported results and shareholders equity  such fluctuations generally do not affect the company s cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses 
the company currently does not hedge any of these risks in its foreign subsidiaries because i the company s brazilian subsidiary derives revenues and incurs expenses within a single country  and consequently  does not incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of its normal operations  ii the british pound sterling  us dollar  and euro are relatively stable against each other  iii other foreign operations are minimal  and iv the company does not believe that hedging transactions are justified by the current exposure and cost at this time
