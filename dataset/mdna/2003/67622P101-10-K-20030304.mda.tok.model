item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we operate our business using four reportable segments boise office solutions  boise building solutions  boise paper solutions  and corporate and other 
boise office solutions markets and sells office supplies  paper  technology products  and office furniture 
boise building solutions manufactures  markets  and distributes various products that are used for construction  while boise paper solutions manufactures  markets  and distributes uncoated free sheet papers  containerboard  corrugated containers  newsprint  and market pulp 
corporate and other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities 
the segments profits and losses are measured on operating profits before interest expense  income taxes  minority interest  extraordinary items  and cumulative effect of accounting changes 
during  lingering weakness in the us economy continued to challenge boise and  in fact  all us business 
in the manufacturing sector  the downturn in the economy began in the fall of and was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on the united states on september  while an economic recovery began late in  manufacturing capacity utilization remained weak during  and prices for our key products were still depressed at year end 
new job formation  which is particularly important to boise office solutions  also remained weak 
late in  the economy sent mixed signals  some signs of strengthening and others of weakness 
we saw mixed signs of improvement in our own businesses as well 
overall  the pace of the economic recovery has been slow and uneven 
in this uncertain environment  we have continued to implement our business strategies to improve boise s competitive position 
we have focused our growth on the distribution of office products and building materials 
shifting our business mix lowers our capital requirements relative to the more capital intensive manufacturing side of our business  generates more consistent earnings  and provides an opportunity for us to take our manufactured products closer to the end user 
we have also focused our paper business on fewer grades and facilities to reduce our capital commitments  achieve stronger market positions  and leverage the advantages of our competitive cost position 
we have worked to improve the competitive cost position of all of our businesses by reducing costs  ensuring consistent quality  adjusting our product mix and sourcing  and increasing the value of our offerings to customers 
finally  we have developed value added products and services in all our businesses 
by reducing the emphasis on pure commodity products  we have the opportunity  over time  to generate higher returns and  more importantly  to compete on business parameters other than price

the nonroutine items  before taxes  discussed above are included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income loss 
see results of operations by segment for additional detail 
operating results compared with total sales in were essentially flat with sales 
boise building solutions sales increased  primarily because of stronger sales in engineered wood products and building materials distribution  while boise paper solutions sales decreased because of lower product prices 
boise office solutions sales and same location sales were flat 
in  materials  labor  and other operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales  compared with  because of increased sales of lower margin products in boise office solutions and lower paper prices in boise paper solutions  partially offset by lower manufacturing costs in our paper business and favorable wood and manufacturing costs in boise building solutions 
selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in  compared with  due primarily to cost control and productivity improvements in boise office solutions 
in  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales  compared with  due to higher compensation and benefits costs 
in accordance with new accounting standards  we stopped amortizing goodwill january  amortization of goodwill in was million after taxes 
interest expense was million in and million in the variance was due mainly to decreases in our debt levels during the year and  to a lesser degree  changes in interest rates 
before nonroutine items  our effective tax provision rates were and for and the increase in the tax provision rate  compared with the tax provision rate  was due primarily to our charitable donation in of surplus property in vancouver  washington  for which we received a tax benefit 
changes in our tax rates were also due to lower income levels and the mix of domestic and foreign sources of income 
our effective tax benefit rate in was  compared with an effective tax benefit rate of in these unusual tax benefit rates were due to the timing of the recognition of tax benefits associated with the sale and write down of our investment in identitynow 
under income tax accounting rules  in  we were able to recognize a tax benefit of only million related to our million write down in that year 
in contrast  in  we were able to recognize a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of our remaining investment in identitynow and our previous write down 
compared with sales in decreased from sales in because of reduced demand in boise office solutions  lower product prices in boise paper solutions and boise building solutions  and the midyear closure of our idaho plywood and lumber operations 
sales decreased in boise building solutions and in boise paper solutions 
boise office solutions sales decreased in  and same location sales decreased 
boise office solutions total sales decreased at a higher rate than same location sales because divestitures were not totally offset by acquisitions 
in  materials  labor  and other operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales  compared with  because of higher energy costs in boise paper solutions and lower overall sales 
selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales were lower in than in due to our cost reduction efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to the decreased sales in and higher compensation costs 
interest expense was million in and million in the variances were mainly due to decreases in our debt levels and  to a lesser degree  changes in interest rates 
our effective tax benefit rate in was  compared with an effective tax provision rate of in the rate was affected by the nondeductibility of a portion of the write down of our investment in identitynow 
before nonroutine items  our effective tax provision rate was for the decrease in our tax rate  before nonroutine items  compared with the rate  was due primarily to our charitable donation in of surplus property in vancouver  washington  for which we received a tax benefit 
changes in our tax rates were also due to lower income levels and the mix of domestic and foreign sources of income 
before nonroutine items  net income in decreased  compared with net income in in boise paper solutions  paper prices and unit sales volume were lower  and energy and chemical costs were higher 
in boise building solutions  wood products sales prices were lower 
boise office solutions sales billion billion billion segment income million million million segment income before nonroutine items million million million billions sales by product line office supplies and paper technology products office furniture sales by geography united states international sales growth same location sales growth percentage of sales gross profit margin operating expenses operating expenses before nonroutine items operating profit operating profit before nonroutine items operating results compared with segment sales and same location sales were essentially flat in  primarily the result of the sluggish us economy 
customers were more cost conscious in their office products and furniture purchases  and widespread white collar layoffs caused our customers to use fewer office products in boise office solutions saw signs of the business beginning to gradually recover during the second half of the year  as quarterly same store sales  compared with the prior year  were negative in the first half and turned positive in the second half of in  segment income decreased from that reported in  as did operating profit as a percentage of sales 
our gross profit margins decreased because sales of higher margin furniture and office supplies decreased 
paper margins also narrowed in  as the price we paid for paper increased more quickly than the price we charged our customers 
year over year  our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased  primarily as a result of cost controls and productivity improvements that more than offset increased pension and employee medical expenses 
operating expenses were also reduced  to a lesser extent  by eliminating amortization of goodwill january  amortization of goodwill totaled approximately million  before taxes  for this segment in boise office solutions sold  tons of boise s office papers in  an increase of over we also continued to build our sales to us medium sized businesses offices with approximately to employees  sales increased from to gross profit margins on sales to this sector are generally better than those on sales to larger corporate and government offices 
boise office solutions also increased us e commerce sales 
e commerce technology provides convenience for our customers while reducing our cost of operations 
compared with segment sales decreased from to  and same location sales decreased 
segment sales decreased at a higher rate than same location sales because divestitures were not totally offset by acquisitions 
the decrease in same location sales was due mainly to the slowing us economy  which resulted in fewer purchases by our existing us customers 
our gross profit margins were down slightly from to as a result of delivery costs that we were unable to leverage over lower sales 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from to excluding nonroutine items  which includes the reversal of million of unneeded reserves for potential claims rising from the sale in of our european office products operations and the million gain for the sale of our european office products operations  operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 
operating expenses  before nonroutine items  decreased due to our continued efforts to reduce our cost structure and to the sale of our european office products operations  which had higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our other operations 
as a result of a decrease in operating expenses  before nonroutine items  our operating profit as a percentage of sales improved in  compared with results for also include our million share of identitynow s losses 
acquisitions and divestitures in april  we completed a tender offer for the outstanding common stock of boise cascade office products corporation bcop owned by shareholders other than boise 
bcop again became a wholly owned subsidiary of boise 
the purchase price  including transaction costs and payments to shareholders and stock option holders  totaled million 
in september  we sold our european office products operations to guilbert sa of france for approximately million 
the sale resulted in a pretax gain of million 
our sales for these operations totaled million in in october  we acquired the blue star business supplies group of us office products blue star  a distributor and manufacturer of office  packaging  and educational supplies in australia and new zealand  for million in cash and the recording of million in acquisition liabilities 
we have closed acquired distribution centers  and approximately employees have been terminated since our acquisition 
blue star had sales of approximately million in its fiscal year ended april  in october  we contributed the assets of boise marketing services  inc bmsi  our majority owned promotional products subsidiary  to identitynow 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase business combination 
identitynow issued shares of its voting common stock in exchange for the assets of bmsi 
the assets exchanged were nonmonetary 
based on the postmerger business plan and cash flow projections  the value of the identitynow common stock received was equal to the value of the bmsi assets contributed 
accordingly  no gain or loss was recorded on the transaction 
on a pro forma basis  if our acquisitions and divestitures in this segment had occurred on january   sales for that year would have decreased about million  while net income and diluted earnings per share would not have materially changed 
in december  we wrote down our investment in identitynow by million to its estimated fair value of million and recorded million of tax benefits associated with the write down 
the write down was the result of analysis performed after we received notice in december that the consolidated group of which identitynow is a member was experiencing liquidity problems that could affect identitynow 
in addition  the promotional products industry was hit hard in by the decline in the us economy  as companies reduced their discretionary spending 
also in december  identitynow provided us with revised revenue projections showing lower sales for the company than previously estimated 
based on this information  we concluded that a decline in the fair value of our investment in identitynow was more than temporary 
we wrote down our investment using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
in may  we sold the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary that held our investment in identitynow 
we recorded a million pretax loss related to this sale 
we also recorded million of tax benefits associated with this sale and our previous write down 
in order to reflect our management of the disposal of this investment  the sale and prior write down in december were recorded in the corporate and other segment 
boise acquired a contract furniture dealer in orange county  california  in and a contract furniture dealer based in illinois in these acquisitions increased boise s presence as a full service office furniture dealer but were not material to our financial position or results of operations

b gross invoice price less trade discounts and freight costs 
operating results compared with sales increased in a decline in panel sales was more than offset by sales growth of in our engineered wood products laminated veneer lumber  wood i joists  and laminated beams and in building materials distribution due to an increase in physical sales volume 
plywood unit sales volume and selling prices decreased and  respectively  while particleboard unit sales volume and selling prices decreased and  respectively 
these price declines resulted in part from excess market supply of plywood and decreased demand for particleboard in compared with plywood sales volumes declined due to the closure of our idaho facilities in oriented strand board unit sales volumes and selling prices increased and  respectively 
average prices for our mix of lumber products  which is mostly ponderosa pine appearance and industrial grades  increased in  while sales volumes decreased 
consistent with the decline in plywood  lumber sales volumes declined due to the closure of our idaho facilities 
during  nearly one fourth of the sales by our building materials distribution business were from products manufactured by boise 
our distribution business sold of the lumber we manufactured  of our panels  and of our engineered wood products 
segment income increased million as reported  or million before nonroutine items  from to the increase  before nonroutine items  resulted from increased distribution sales discussed above and favorable wood and manufacturing costs 
in  we began construction of a new facility near elma  washington  to manufacture integrated wood polymer building materials 
the plant should start up early in the initial product will be exterior siding marketed under the name homeplate siding 
this siding will be manufactured from recycled plastic and urban wood 
we will market the product in the western united states and canada and will distribute it primarily through our building materials distribution facilities 
in  segment income included million of incremental business organization costs  including plant commissioning and start up expenses  for our external siding plant 
in fourth quarter  our wholly owned subsidiary  boise cascade do brasil ltda  began operating a veneer and plywood mill in the city of guaiba  rio grande do sul  brazil 
the mill  which uses plantation eucalyptus  is able to produce million square feet of veneer a year 
about of the veneer is intended for production of lvl at our plant in alexandria  louisiana 
we expect the remainder to be processed into plywood in brazil 
as we integrate increasing amounts of our veneer into our lvl operations in alexandria  we expect to lower wood costs  create new product opportunities  and expand profitability 
voyageur panel  a joint venture in barwick  ontario  canada  has the capacity to produce million square feet of osb panels annually 
we hold of the equity 
we have an agreement with voyageur panel under which we operate the plant and market its product 
our investment in this venture was million and million at december  and a canadian forest products manufacturer and two insurance companies own the remaining equity interest 
we account for the joint venture under the equity method 
accordingly  segment results do not include the joint venture s sales but do include million and million of equity in losses for and and million of equity in earnings for the debt of this affiliate  which totaled million and million at december  and  has been issued without recourse to us 
the other shareholders have the right to require voyageur panel to buy their equity interests at fair market value 
we have the right to buy any shares sold back to voyageur panel before they are sold to other investors 
compared with sales decreased in because of the closure of our plywood and lumber operations in emmett  idaho  and our sawmill in cascade  idaho  and lower sales prices for all of our wood products 
average plywood prices declined  oriented strand board osb   and lumber  
plywood and lumber sales volumes declined due to the closure of the idaho facilities 
distribution sales were about flat  compared with  as lower prices were offset by higher sales volume 
segment income in decreased  compared with  due to the idaho closures and lower wood products volumes and prices 
delivered log costs declined  which offset increased conversion and distribution costs 
acquisitions in october  we purchased the assets of a building materials distribution operation in riverside  california  for million 
this acquisition marked our entrance into the southern california market area in this business but was not material to our financial position or results of operations 
in june  we acquired alliance forest products joists  inc alljoist  for million in cash 
formerly a subsidiary of alliance forest products  inc  alljoist operates a wood i joist manufacturing plant in st 
jacques  new brunswick  canada 
this acquisition expanded our engineered wood products business and added i joists with solid sawn lumber flanges to our product line 
on a pro forma basis  if the alljoist acquisition had occurred on january   boise building solutions sales in would have increased million  while net income and diluted earnings per share would not have materially changed 
nonroutine items in february  we announced the permanent closure of our plywood and lumber operations in emmett  idaho  and our sawmill in cascade  idaho  due to the significant decline in federal timber offered for sale 
we completed these closures in second quarter  and positions were eliminated 
in first quarter  we recorded a pretax charge of million related to these closures 
sales for our idaho operations for the years ended december  and  were million and million 
the operating loss for the year ended december   was million  while operating income for the year ended december   was million 
in addition  in first quarter  we wrote off our investment in assets in chile with a pretax charge of million 
we recorded both of these charges in our boise building solutions segment and in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of loss for the year ended december  restructuring reserve activity related to these charges is as follows asset write downs employee related costs other exit costs total thousands expense recorded     assets written down   pension liabilities recorded   charges against reserve    restructuring reserve at december   proceeds from sales of assets   charges against reserve   restructuring reserve at december    we recorded asset write downs for plant and equipment at the closed idaho facilities and the write off of our equity investment in and related receivables from a joint venture in chile 
employee related costs included pension curtailment costs from the shutdowns of the idaho facilities and severance costs 
we recorded other exit costs  including tear down and environmental cleanup costs related to the idaho facilities and reserves for contractual obligations with no future benefit 
the remaining reserve balance will be spent in these restructuring reserve liabilities are included in accrued liabilities  other in the consolidated balance sheets 
boise paper solutions sales billion billion billion segment income million million million sales volumes thousands of short tons uncoated free sheet    containerboard newsprint other average net selling prices per short ton a uncoated free sheet containerboard newsprint a gross invoice price less trade discounts and freight costs 
operating results compared with sales declined in  as weighted average paper prices declined per ton  or  compared with uncoated free sheet prices declined  containerboard prices declined  and newsprint prices declined 
low demand in a recessionary economy contributed to these price declines 
despite decreased demand  boise paper solutions unit sales volume increased 
the increase was primarily the result of strong integration of our paper and office products businesses 
in  we sold  tons of our paper through boise office solutions  an increase of from to boise office solutions is now the largest single customer of boise paper solutions 
in  about of our total uncoated free sheet paper  including about of our office papers  was sold through our office products business 
we also increased sales of value added papers produced on our smaller machines 
they were up in to about  tons 
value added grades produced on our smaller paper machines accounted for of our uncoated free sheet sales volume in value added grades generally have higher unit costs than commodities but also have higher net sales prices and profit margins 
overall  the average net selling price of the value added grades we sold in was per ton higher than the average net selling price of our uncoated commodity grades 
segment income decreased  compared with  due to lower paper prices  which were partially offset by increased unit sales volume and lower unit manufacturing costs 
unit manufacturing costs decreased in the largest cost improvements resulted from falling energy  fiber  and chemical costs 
during  we took approximately  tons of market related curtailment and approximately  tons of downtime for capital projects and maintenance  compared with approximately  tons and  tons  respectively  in  mostly in uncoated free sheet

we have sold fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of trade accounts receivable 
at december    and  million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in the consolidated balance sheets  compared with the december   balance of million 
the increase of million in sold accounts receivable at december   over the amount at december   provided cash from operations in our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was in  compared with in the change in this ratio in is primarily the result of the reclassification of our revolving credit debt to long term debt with the signing of a new agreement that expires in most of our us employees are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the assets of the pension plans are invested primarily in common stocks  fixed income securities  and cash equivalents

see note of item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
in  our debt increased million to billion 
our debt to equity ratio was at december   and at december  even though our debt remained about the same  our debt to equity ratio rose due to a million decrease in shareholders equity from recording additional minimum pension liability 
changes in our credit ratings have no impact on our current senior long term debt except for our revolving credit agreement  which has a pricing mechanism that is  in part  dependent on our credit rating 
such changes could also affect our cost of future borrowings 
in march  we entered into a three year  unsecured revolving credit agreement with major financial institutions 
the agreement permits us to borrow as much as million at variable interest rates based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the borrowing capacity under the agreement can be expanded to a maximum of million 
the revolving credit agreement replaces a similar agreement that would have expired in june borrowings of million under the old agreement were repaid 
borrowings under the new agreement were million at december  at december   our borrowing rate under the agreement was 
we have entered into interest rate swaps related to million of these borrowings  which gave us an effective interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of at december  the revolving credit agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing  including compliance with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio  and ceiling ratio of debt to capitalization 
under this agreement  the payment of dividends depends on the existence and amount of net worth in excess of the defined minimum 
our net worth at december   exceeded the defined minimum by million 
when the agreement expires in june  any amount outstanding will be due and payable 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
this swap converts million of fixed rate million debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately 
the effective interest rate at december  was 
this swap expires in may in january  we sold million of notes due in we used proceeds from this sale to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and short term debt

the maximum amounts of combined short term borrowings outstanding during the years ended december  and  were million and million 
the average amounts of short term borrowings outstanding during the years ended december  and  were million and million 
for and  the average interest rates for these borrowings were and at december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity registered with the securities and exchange commission sec for additional debt securities 
in addition  a registration statement filed with the sec covering million in universal shelf capacity became effective in april under this registration statement  we may offer and sell in one or more offerings common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  and or purchase contracts 
our cash requirements for both short term and long term needs will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  issuance of new debt or equity securities  and possible sales of assets 
we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be affected by inflation in the future 
declines in building activity that may occur during winter affect our building products businesses 
in addition  some operating costs may increase at facilities affected by cold weather 
seasonal influences  however  are generally not significant 
off balance sheet and other contractual arrangements and guarantees at december   we did not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities 
we have sold fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of accounts receivable 
we account for this sales program under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we have entered into this program to provide us funding at rates favorable to our other borrowing arrangements 
under this program  we sell on a revolving basis substantially all our domestic trade accounts receivable to a fully consolidated  wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary in turn sells a fractional ownership interest in the receivables to affiliates of two banks 
based on the terms of the sale  we record the sales as true sales and not as loans secured by the receivables 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
the portion of fractional ownership interest we retain is included in receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of our retained interest is subordinate to the interests of the bank affiliates  providing them credit support if the receivables become uncollectible 
the impact of the credit support is reflected in our allowance for uncollectible receivables 
the proceeds available under this program are subject to change based on the level of eligible receivables  restrictions on the concentrations of receivables  and the historical performance of the receivables we sell 
the available proceeds may not exceed million under our current agreements 
our costs under this program vary based on changes in interest rates 
they totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the purchasers of the receivables commit to our securitization program in day increments 
when the current program expires  none of the parties are obligated to renew the arrangement 
our experience over the last four years  however  has been that the parties do renew the arrangement with minimal alterations 
if the program were not renewed  we would obtain replacement funding from alternative funding sources 
use of those sources  however  might result in an increase in our interest expense and an increase in both liabilities and assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
contractual obligations our fixed  noncancelable obligations as of december   were as follows payments due by period less than year years years more than years total thousands long term debt a e     operating leases b      purchase obligations raw materials c      utilities d      capital spending     other     other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet compensation and benefits e f    other e      company obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trust holding solely debentures of parent g  a included in long term debt are amounts owed on our note agreements  revenue bonds  and our revolving credit agreement at december  these borrowings are further explained in note of item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
see note of item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k for more information 
c included in raw materials is million for contracts to purchase timber 
we acquire a portion of our wood requirements from outside sources 
except for deposits required pursuant to wood supply contracts  these obligations are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until contract payment terms take effect 
the obligations are subject to change based on  among other things  the effect of governmental laws and regulations  our manufacturing operations not operating in the normal course of business  timber availability  and the status of environmental appeals 
d we enter into utility contracts for the purchase of electricity and natural gas 
we also purchase these services under utility tariffs 
the contractual and tariff arrangements include multiple year commitments and minimum annual purchase requirements 
our payment obligations were valued at prices in effect on december   or contract language  if available 
these obligations represent the face value of the contracts and do not consider resale value 
e the current portion of these liabilities is also included 
f compensation and benefits includes amounts associated with our retirement and benefit plans and other compensation arrangements

in addition to the fixed and or legally binding obligations that are quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business 
these contracts  however  are either cancelable or subject to change based on  among other things  fires  floods  or other catastrophic events beyond our control  the effect of forestry  land use  environmental  or other governmental laws and regulations  and or our manufacturing operations not operating in the normal course of business 
guarantees note of item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k describes the nature of our guarantees  including the approximate terms of the guarantees  how the guarantees arose  the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees  and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make 
disclosures of financial market risks our debt is predominantly fixed rate 
at december   the estimated current market value of our debt  based on then current interest rates for similar obligations with like maturities  was approximately million less than the amount of debt reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our other financial instruments  cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and short term borrowings are the same as their carrying values 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any significant concentration of credit risks 
concentration of credit risks with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and channels to and through which our products are sold  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas 
changes in interest and currency rates expose the company to financial market risk 
we occasionally use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  rate hedge agreements  forward purchase contracts  and forward exchange contracts  to hedge underlying debt obligations or anticipated transactions 
we do not use them for trading purposes 
for qualifying hedges  the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap or underlying debt 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in income or as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occur 
unrealized gains and losses on all other forward exchange contracts are included in current period net income loss 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
this swap converts million of fixed rate million debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately 
the effective interest rate at december   was 
the swap expires in may this swap is designated as a fair value hedge of a proportionate amount of the fixed rate debentures 
the swap and the proportionate amount of debentures are marked to market  with changes in the fair value of the instruments recorded in income loss 
this swap was fully effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the hedged item  accordingly  changes in the fair value of these instruments had no net impact on our reported income loss in the current periods 
in january and august  we entered into swaps for electricity that convert and megawatts of usage in the northwest to a fixed rate 
the january swap expired at the end of  and the august swap expires at the end of in january  we also entered into natural gas swaps that convert  mmbtu per day of natural gas usage to a fixed price 
these swaps expire in march these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these swaps  net of taxes  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
these swaps were fully effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each  maturing in february and february also  in november  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  maturing in november the swaps hedge the variable cash flow risk from the variable interest payments on million of our revolving credit agreement 
the effective fixed interest rate in both and was 
changes in the fair value of these swaps  net of taxes  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense as interest expense is recognized on the revolving credit agreement 
amounts reclassified in and totaled million and million  respectively 
assuming no change in interest rates  million would be reclassified in ineffectiveness related to these hedges was not significant 
we are exposed to modest credit related risks in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
however  we do not expect the counterparties  which are all major financial institutions  to fail to meet their obligations 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates or utility indexes 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for obligations with variable interest rates and energy market risk sensitivity  the table sets forth payout amounts based on current rates and does not attempt to project future rates 
other instruments subject to market risk  such as obligations for pension plans and other postretirement benefits  are not reflected in the table

in  we closed our plywood and lumber operations in emmett  idaho  and our sawmill in cascade  idaho  due to the significant decline in federal timber offered for sale 
further constraints on timber supply  both on public and private lands  that would affect our remaining facilities may be imposed in the future 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future log supply and costs 
additional curtailments or closures of our wood products manufacturing facilities are possible 
in march  we announced that we will discontinue harvesting from old growth forests by less than of our wood supply comes from old growth forests  most of it from federal lands 
we are making no new commitments to enter into federal timber contracts that require harvest of timber from old growth forests 
this announcement formally recognized a trend that boise had already been following and will not materially affect our available timber supply 
we meet an important share of our fiber needs with the million acres of timberland we own or control 
during  of our fiber needs were met by internal sources  by private sources  and by government sources 
during  these percentages were   and  and during  they were   and 
long term leases of private timberlands generally provide boise with timber harvesting rights and carry with them responsibility for managing the timberlands 
the remaining life of all leases ranges from to years 
in addition  we have an option to purchase approximately  acres of timberland under lease and or contract in the southern united states 
we manage our timberlands so that they will provide a continuous and sustainable supply of wood for future needs 
our two northwest pulp and paper mills receive approximately of their wood chips from internal sources  including our wood products and whole log chipping operations and our cottonwood fiber farm near wallula  washington 
roughly of the pulp used by our wallula uncoated free sheet machine during was made from this cottonwood fiber 
in  we purchased approximately  acres of timberland to support the operations of our plywood and lumber mills in northeastern oregon 
we also sold approximately  acres in alabama 
in  we purchased approximately  acres of timberland to support the operations of our pulp and paper mill in jackson  alabama 
fiber for our veneer and plywood plant in brazil is initially coming from private sources 
boise manages the land and trees and schedules the harvest for one of these private sources in brazil under multiyear agreements 
this private source provides a significant portion of our plant s fiber needs 
in  we also purchased approximately  acres of eucalyptus plantation land in brazil to meet the future fiber requirements of the plant 
our forest management practices embrace the sustainable forestry initiative sfi program  a comprehensive system of principles  objectives  and performance measures that integrates the sustainable growing and harvesting of trees with protection of wildlife  plants  soil  and water quality 
in  we upgraded boise s forest stewardship program to include ongoing third party audits of our forest management practices on the timberland we own or control in the united states and on other private and public lands from which we purchase timber 
during  the sfi program was expanded to include a product labeling component for manufactured products 
under this program  an audit of the manufacturing fiber sources and processes is conducted by an independent third party 
products manufactured at a certified facility can be sold bearing the sfi label 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc  an international audit firm  was retained to perform forest management and wood fiber procurement audits of company lands and operations 
the pwc audit teams included technical experts in forest engineering  forest planning  range management  silviculture  and wildlife management 
auditors interviewed boise employees  contractors  timber dealers  state and federal agency employees  landowners from whom the company has purchased timber  and neighboring landowners 
auditors also inspected office processes  numerous forest sites  and manufacturing facilities 
these audits certified our full conformance with sfi program standards and confirmed our conformance with our internal forest stewardship values and measures 
the audits identified good management practices  where our performance was judged to be above average for the industry  and opportunities for improvement  where management practices and processes could be upgraded 
based on the auditors feedback  we developed and are implementing action plans to continuously improve our forest management practices 
we have a forest stewardship advisory council of nationally known conservation experts who participate with our forest managers in reviewing audit results and recommending any changes 
in addition  our customers are invited to accompany audit teams into the forests to observe their work 
for each of our facilities  we invest substantial capital to comply with federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the interruption or suspension of our operations or could require additional expenditures 
we anticipate that we will spend approximately million in to comply with environmental requirements 
we anticipate spending similar or greater amounts in the years ahead 
these capital expenditures  along with our established operating procedures and controls  should allow us to continue to meet environmental standards 
in january  the environmental protection agency epa proposed rules that regulate air emissions from boilers and wood panel plants 
we expect the epa to finalize these rules in while the final requirements are not yet known  we could spend million to million to comply with these rules during the period from to we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar federal and state laws  or have received a claim from a private party  with respect to active sites where hazardous substances or other contaminants are or may be located 
in most cases  we are one of many potentially responsible parties  and our alleged contribution to these sites is relatively minor 
for sites where a range of potential liability can be determined  we have established appropriate reserves 
we believe we have minimal or no responsibility with regard to several other sites 
we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of the total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups 
based on our investigations  our experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances  the fact that expenditures will  in many cases  be incurred over extended periods of time  and the number of solvent potentially responsible parties  we do not believe that the known actual and potential response costs will  in the aggregate  materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
these estimates require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our current critical accounting estimates are as follows pensions most of our us employees are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
we account for these costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
this statement requires us to calculate our pension expense and liabilities using actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate assumption and a long term asset return assumption 
we base our discount rate assumption on the rates of return on high quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
we base our long term asset return assumption on the average rate of earnings expected on invested funds 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  based on the performance of plan assets and actuarial valuations  and the impact on our financial position and results of operations could be material 
the estimate for pensions is a critical accounting estimate for all of our segments 
for  our discount rate assumption was  and our long term asset return assumption was 
using these assumptions  our pension expense was million  following million and million of expense in and if we had decreased our estimated discount rate to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would have been million and net income would have decreased approximately million 
if we had increased our discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would have been million and net income would have increased approximately million 
for  our discount rate assumption is  and our expected return on plan assets is 
using these assumptions  we estimate that our pension expense will be approximately million 
if we were to decrease our estimated discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
if we were to increase our discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
plan contributions include required minimums and  in some years  additional discretionary amounts 
for  the required minimum contribution was million 
in  we made cash contributions to our pension plans totaling million  compared with million in and million in in  the required minimum contribution to our pension plans is estimated to be million 
however  we expect to make contributions to the plans of approximately million to million during we expect to make similar contributions in we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to meet our future pension requirements 
the amount of additional minimum pension liability is determined based on the value of plan assets compared to the plans accumulated benefit obligation 
because of negative returns on plan assets in and  our minimum pension liability increased significantly  resulting in a decrease of million in and million in in shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   our discount rate assumption was 
if we had changed our estimated discount rate to  our minimum pension liability adjustment would have decreased shareholders equity million 
if we had changed our discount rate assumption to  our minimum pension liability adjustment would have decreased shareholders equity million 
the change in the additional minimum liability that we will record in will be dependent on the actual market value of plan assets on our valuation date december and the assumptions chosen at that date 
when recorded  the adjustments to the minimum pension liability are noncash and do not affect net income loss 
our revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants relating to minimum net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio  and ceiling ratio of debt to capitalization 
under this agreement  the payment of dividends depends on the existence and amount of net worth in excess of the defined minimum 
our net worth at december   exceeded the defined minimum by million 
if we had used the more conservative assumptions identified above and decreased shareholders equity further due to a larger minimum pension liability adjustment  we would still have met our minimum net worth covenant 
environmental remediation we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
as is the case with other companies in similar industries  we face exposure from actual or potential claims and legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
we account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position we record liabilities on an undiscounted basis when assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate our environmental liabilities based on various assumptions and judgments  as we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete any remediation 
in making these judgments and assumptions  we consider  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites  information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors  and our historical experience at other sites that are judged to be comparable 
due to the number of uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments and the effects of changes in governmental regulation and environmental technologies  the precision of the resulting estimates of the related liabilities is subject to uncertainty 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to our environmental liabilities  and as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change 
goodwill impairment we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  typically resulting in goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
the statement requires estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 
if we determine the fair values are less than the carrying amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  we must recognize an impairment in our financial statements 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
of the million  million and million were recorded in our boise office solutions and boise building solutions segments  respectively 
during the second quarter  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill using data from january  in our boise office solutions and boise building solutions segments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we concluded that no impairment existed 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units based upon discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our estimated average cost of funds 
differences in assumptions used in projecting future operating cash flows and cost of funds could have a significant impact on the determination of impairment amounts 
in estimating future cash flows for our office products and building products businesses  we used our internal budgets 
our budgets were based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches or capital projects  and customer commitments related to new and existing products 
these budgets also included assumptions of future production volumes and pricing of commodity products 
due to the inherent volatility of commodity product pricing  our pricing assumptions were based on the average pricing over the commodity cycle 
these prices were estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts  and other published forecasts 
if our estimates of projected future cash flows were too high by  there would be no impact on the reported value of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires that an enterprise s consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries in which the enterprise has a controlling financial interest 
at december   we did not have any unconsolidated variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 however  we do not currently plan to adopt the fair value accounting model and will continue to use the compensation measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of interpretation no 
became effective for periods ending after december  the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation no 
became effective january  this statement will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under the new statement  we will record both an initial asset and a liability discounted for estimated costs of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
the initial asset will be depreciated over the expected useful life of the asset 
this statement will change our accounting for landfill closure costs 
we currently accrue the estimated costs of closure over the expected useful life of the landfill 
we adopted this statement january   and recognized a one time charge of approximately million  after tax  as a cumulative effect adjustment in our consolidated statement of income loss 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted this statement january  it had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred as opposed to the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
it also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
we adopted this statement january   and it had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
outlook given the continued weakness in the us economy  disruptions from severe winter weather  and our rising pension costs  we expect overall results in early to be weak 
quarterly pension expense will be about million higher in than in assuming a strengthening economy  we would expect to see stronger results as the year progresses
