item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is to inform you about our financial position  liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  and the results of operations for the years ended december   and general due to global events  weather conditions  domestic production decline and signs of a slowly improving economy  commodity prices have strengthened since the first quarter of the current natural gas storage level is below the five year average and global uncertainty remains relative to our domestic crude oil supply 
we continue to be optimistic about the longer term outlook for natural gas 
however  the overall environment for commodity pricing is very volatile and can be materially affected  favorably or unfavorably  by such factors as imports exports  weather trends  power generation and industrial demands 
natural gas drilling activity has increased during the last quarter of and early but sustained activity will be dependent on long term price stability 
liquidity and capital resources a company s liquidity is the amount of time expected to elapse until an asset can be converted to cash or conversely until a liability has to be paid 
liquidity is one indication of a company s ability to meet its obligations or commitments 
historically  our major sources of liquidity have come from internally generated cash flow from operations  funds generated from the exercise of warrants options and proceeds from public and private stock offerings 
the following table represents the sources and uses of cash for the years indicated 
for the years ended december  beginning cash balance sources of cash cash provided by operations cash provided by financing activities cash provided by sales of oil gas properties and equipment cash provided from acquisition total sources of cash including cash on hand uses of cash oil and gas expenditures  net of prepaid drillingadvances other equipment cash used by financing activities total uses of cash ending cash balance our working capital was a  deficit at december  compared to a  deficit at december  and a  surplus at december  even though our net working capital position and liquidity improved in  several factors or events negatively impacted this improvement 
these factors were lower than anticipated production rates from our gulf coast and south texas properties  a significant cost overrun of approximately million net to our working interest and limited production associated with the rubel  sara white prospect located in galveston county  texas  higher operating expense associated with unplanned weather related repairs on certain mid continent properties and no significant production additions from our exploration and development activity during the year 
at december   we had a futures transaction hedge liability  associated with that portion of our future production volume currently hedged  of  compared to a futures derivative asset of  at december  the futures transaction hedge asset liability represents the potential unrealized increase or decrease in our future oil and gas revenue based on the current outstanding derivative contracts 
the estimate is based on the nymex natural gas and crude oil futures prices in effect at december  and december  which may vary materially from month to month 
total proved reserve volumes at december  were bcf of natural gas and mbbl of oil  or bcfe of natural gas compared to december  proved reserves of bcf of natural gas and mbbl of oil or bcfe of natural gas 
total proved reserves decreased approximately bcfe  or  from the prior year primarily due to the reclassification of the reserves associated with our west broussard prospect from proved undeveloped pud to non proven and production of approximately bcfe of natural gas 
for the twelve months ended december   we expended approximately million net of prepaid drilling advances primarily comprised of million related to our jackson county drilling  seismic and leasing activity  million expended on the rubel  sara white prospect located in galveston county  texas  million for the drilling  completion and land activity associated with our brookshire dome project located in waller county texas  
million on additional land activity in our west broussard prospect  
million expended on the recompletion and rework of our west cameron block production and 
million for drilling  remedial and rework activity in the mid continent area 
since  our working capital and liquidity have significantly decreased due to intensified drilling and lease acquisition activity  which primarily occurred in the last half of this activity was funded from cash flow from operations  funds received from our preferred stock private placement  and proceeds from the sale of certain evaluated and unevaluated oil and gas properties 
approximately million was expended during on our exploration and development program  including the acquisition of additional working interests in production and leasehold acreage  both evaluated and unevaluated 
the results from our exploration program have been disappointing in regards to the discovery of any significant fields or extensions 
in  due to no significant proved producing reserve additions  our borrowing base capacity under the current credit facility  which was acquired through the red river energy acquisition  has not increased and is not a material source of capital 
however  historically we have not used credit facilities for a source of funds in our drilling or leasing activity 
should proved developed reserves not materially increase and or pricing decline  our borrowing base may be reduced below the amount currently borrowed and outstanding under this facility 
if this event occurs we would be obligated to pay down the outstanding amount to the re determined borrowing capacity 
we would rely on cash flow from operations and possibly funds generated from the sale of unevaluated prospects to make this pay down 
it is possible that we would have to sell some non core assets as well in order to meet this obligation 
the current credit agreement has a maturity date of march  and the next re determination will take place in late march at december   our borrowing capacity was  and a balance of  was outstanding against the borrowing base 
our effective interest rate  which is a libor base rate plus  was approximately 
we expect to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit agreement to april and maintain the current collateral borrowing base of  our principal source of short term liquidity for will be our operating cash flow 
our short term liquidity and working capital should steadily increase in due to a lower capital expenditure program and the prospect of stronger natural gas and crude oil prices 
an additional source of short term liquidity may come in the form of funds received from the sale of all or a portion of our interests in certain unevaluated projects or non core assets 
we intend to further reduce our working interest in certain unevaluated projects to enhance our risk profile and improve our cash position and working capital 
long term liquidity and capital resources we have no material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we have with our exploratory drilling activities in future periods  gas and oil price conditions and other related economic factors 
the following tables show our contractual obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total cash obligations  is related to our current credit agreement with a commercial bank
