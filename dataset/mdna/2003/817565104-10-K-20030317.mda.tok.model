operating measures the company s outlook for north america comparable funeral revenues assumes an equivalent amount to slightly fewer funeral services performed offset by projected low single digit percentage increases in the average revenue per funeral service compared to levels 
the north america comparable funeral gross margin percentage should be positively impacted in by reductions in costs related to changes in the company s sales structure and processes 
this positive impact will be somewhat offset by increased personnel including pension and insurance costs 
the company s outlook for north america comparable cemetery revenues is projected to be below levels resulting from more normalized levels of completion of cemetery property development projects in compared to as well as from projected reductions in revenues resulting from changes in the company s sales structure and processes 
the north america comparable cemetery gross margin percentage should be flat to slightly down in as a result of the lower projected cemetery revenues as well as from higher expected cemetery maintenance costs 
these negative impacts should be partially offset by cash savings resulting from the changes in the company s sales structure and processes described earlier 
revenues and the gross margin percentage from international operations are expected to be flat to above levels primarily related to a projected improvement in operating performance in from the company s french operations

critical accounting policies and accounting changes the company s consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of the company s critical accounting policies pertaining to revenue recognition  the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and the use of estimates 
revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
the company s trade receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
the company sells price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see note four to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
sales of atneed cemetery interment rights  merchandise and services are recognized when the service is performed or merchandise delivered 
preneed cemetery interment sales of constructed cemetery burial property are not recognized until a minimum of of the sales price has been collected 
once of the sales price is collected  all of the constructed interment sale revenue is recognized 
revenues related to the preneed sale of unconstructed cemetery burial property is deferred until such property is constructed and the minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
currently  the company defers certain direct selling costs  primarily commissions and fringe benefits  associated with preneed cemetery sales and then expenses those costs as the associated revenue is recognized 
see notes three and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
costs related to the sales of interment rights are the accumulation of property costs and development costs specifically identified by project 
at the completion of the project  costs are charged to operations as revenue is recognized 
costs related to sales of merchandise and services are based on actual costs incurred 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be held and used be reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the company are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
in  the company ceased depreciation of operating assets held for sale during the year 
during the year  the company determined transactions to sell or joint venture certain assets would be delayed until after as a result  the company resumed normal depreciation of those assets held in france and chile in the third quarter of use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management  among others  include allowance for doubtful accounts the company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts based on analysis of historical collection activity 
these estimates could be impacted by changes in the economy  among other things 
depreciation of long lived assets the company depreciates its long lived assets over their estimated useful lives 
these estimates of useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions or changes in regulatory requirements 
in  the company changed the estimated useful life of its existing information technology systems as a result of the decision to implement a new north america point of sale system and an upgraded general ledger system 
the company recognized approximately million of additional amortization expense relate to this change in estimate 
amortization of deferred selling costs the company changed the amortization period of its deferred prearranged funeral selling costs from years to years  a period representing the estimated life of the prearranged funeral contracts 
the change in estimate was made in order to more accurately reflect current trends regarding the timeframe from when a prearranged contract is sold to when it is serviced atneed 
this change in estimate reduced funeral gross profit by approximately million 
in future years  this estimate could be further impacted by changes in mortality rates and changes in the demographics of the company s customers 
taxes the company s ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets requires the company to achieve certain future earnings levels 
the company has established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets and could be required to further adjust that valuation allowance if market conditions change materially and future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly different from its current estimates 
the company intends to permanently reinvest the unremitted earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries in those businesses outside the united states and  therefore  has not provided for deferred federal income taxes on such unremitted foreign earnings 
preneed cemetery revenues the company recognizes revenues associated with preneed cemetery merchandise and services upon evidence of delivery of such merchandise and services 
the company has an ongoing review program of its obligations for delivery of cemetery merchandise and services 
included in the company s backlog of preneed cemetery contract revenues of approximately billion are estimates made by management related to the status of delivery of cemetery merchandise and services 
any changes in these estimates in future periods and resulting revenue recognition of these obligations will vary and depend upon the outcome of such continuous obligation reviews 
pension cost the company s pension costs and liabilities are actuarily determined based on certain assumptions including expected long term rates of return on plan assets and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
the company s policy is to use a discount rate comparable to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the company s pension benefits 
actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in the assumptions  or experience different from those assumptions  are amortized over the remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans 
accounting changes in  the company adopted sfas no

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations and established the purchase method for accounting for such transactions 
sfas no

 the company recognized a charge reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change of million or 
per diluted share related to the impairment of goodwill in its north american cemetery reporting unit 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superceded sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets to be held and used be written down to fair value when it is concluded that the carrying value of such assets are not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis 
assets to be disposed of by sale are required to be recorded at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less estimated cost to sell

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivatives instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
in accordance with these pronouncements  the company recognized a cumulative effect of accounting change of million or 
per diluted share 
the charge primarily related to the recognition of net deferred charges from interest rate gains and losses realized on the termination of swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges 
these charges were previously amortized into interest expense over the terms of the swap agreements  whereas the new standards require recognition as the derivative gains and losses are incurred 
in  the company implemented sab no 
which changed the company s accounting policies regarding the manner in which it records prearranged sales activities 
the implementation of sab no 
had no effect on the consolidated cash flows of the company

for purposes of discussion in this section  the use of the term prearranged or prearrangement refers to funeral programs specifically or funeral and cemetery programs generally 
the use of the term preneed refers to cemetery programs specifically 
prearrangement is a means through which a customer contractually agrees to the terms of a funeral and or cemetery burial to be performed or provided in the future 
revenues associated with prearranged contracts are deferred until such time that the funeral or cemetery services are performed or merchandise is delivered 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property are not recognized until a minimum of of the sales price has been collected and the property has been constructed 
compensation costs incurred related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral trust contracts  primarily commissions and fringe benefits  are deferred as selling costs and amortized over years  a period representing the estimated life of the prearranged funeral contracts 
prior to  the amortization period was years 
as of january   the company changed the estimated period to years to more accurately reflect current trends regarding the timeframe from selling a preneed contract to when it is serviced atneed 
the amount of funeral deferred selling costs amortized in the consolidated statement of operations for north america was million and million in and  respectively 
had the company changed the amortization period in from to years  the amortization expense would have been million in cemetery deferred selling costs  primarily commissions and fringe benefits  are expensed as the associated revenues are recognized 
other costs associated with the sales and marketing of prearranged contracts lead procurements costs  brochures and marketing materials  advertising and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
when prearranged funeral services and merchandise are funded through insurance policies purchased by customers from third party life insurance companies  the company earns a commission on the sale of such policies for acting as an agent in selling such insurance contracts 
such general agency revenues are based on a percentage per contract sold and are recognized  net of related expenses  when the insurance purchase transaction between the customer and third party insurance provider has been completed 
in and  million and million  respectively  of net general agency revenues were recognized 
excluding the related expenses being netted against the associated general agency commissions  the company recognized million and million of general agency revenues in and  respectively

the table below details the north america results of funeral and cemetery prearranged production for the years ended december  and and the related deferred selling costs incurred to procure the prearrangements 
additionally  the table reflects revenues recognized and previously deferred selling costs recognized in the consolidated statements of operations associated with previously prearranged production for the years ended december  and north america funeral cemetery origination prearranged production deferred selling costs maturity previously prearranged production included in current period revenues amortization recognition of deferred selling costs in current period the amortization of funeral deferred selling costs reflects the historical amount recorded in if the amortization period was changed from to years as of january   the amortization would have been million 
as described earlier  prearranged contracts can be funded through several alternatives 
for prearranged funeral or preneed cemetery contracts funded through trusts  generally all or a certain portion of the funds collected are required to be placed into trust accounts  pursuant to applicable law 
funds not required to be placed into trust accounts are retained by the company and used for working capital purposes to help alleviate the current cost of those prearrangement programs 
realized investment earnings on funds placed into trust accounts are generally accumulated and deferred until the maturity of each prearranged contract 
however  in certain states  the company is allowed to distribute a portion of the realized investment earnings before the prearrangement contract matures 
when a prearranged trust contract matures  the company receives the principal and previously undistributed trust fund income and any remaining receivable due from the customer 
in certain situations  the company can post a surety bond as financial assurance pursuant to applicable law in an amount that would otherwise be required to be trusted 
funds collected on prearranged contracts where the company has posted a surety bond may be retained by the company creating a source of working capital cash flow generated from operating activities before the prearranged contract matures 
when the prearranged contract matures  the company receives any remaining receivable due from the customer 
finally  the customer may elect to purchase an insurance contract from a third party life insurance company to fund a prearranged funeral contract  the funds of which are collected and used to pay premiums on life insurance or annuity contracts 
increasing death benefits associated with life insurance contracts are accumulated and deferred until the maturity of each prearranged contract 
when a prearranged insurance contract matures  the company receives the proceeds from the third party insurance companies consisting of the original contract amount and any increasing death benefits 
deferred prearranged funeral contract revenue or preneed cemetery contract revenue is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at the time the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered 
for trust or bonded contracts  the revenue recognized is generally greater than the cash received by the company at the time a prearranged contract matures and creates a negative effect on working capital cash flow generated from operating activities 
the cash flow activity from originating funeral production until the maturity of the prearranged funeral contract is captured in the line item net effect of prearranged funeral production and maturities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
cash flow is provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and distributed trust fund earnings 
this is reduced by the payment of deferred selling costs and the use of funds to service matured contracts 
the cash flow activity from originating the preneed cemetery contract until recognition of the deferred revenue is reflected through changes in receivables and changes in other assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
changes in receivables is affected by cash flow provided by the amount retained from funds collected from the customer and distributed trust earnings  and is reduced by the use of funds to service preneed cemetery contracts 
changes in other assets is affected by the cash use associated with the payment of deferred selling costs when the preneed cemetery contracts are originated  offset by the reduction in deferred selling costs associated with recognition of the preneed cemetery revenue 
the following table reflects the total north american backlog of deferred prearranged contract revenues and the prearranged assets associated with the contracts at december the difference between the amounts of deferred prearranged contract revenues and the prearranged assets associated with such contracts represents future revenues to be recognized in which the associated cash has already been collected by the company 
north america funeral cemetery total deferred prearranged contract revenues       deferred net selling costs prearranged assets trust related assets   third party insurance related assets     the deferred prearranged contract revenue associated with prearranged funeral contracts and preneed cemetery contracts are reflected separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
both funeral and cemetery deferred selling costs net of an estimated allowance for cancellation are included as a component of deferred charges and other assets 
prearranged assets associated with prearranged funeral contracts  which consist of amounts due from trusts  customer receivables or third party insurance receivables net of an estimated allowance for cancellations  are reflected as prearranged funeral contracts separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
prearranged assets associated with preneed cemetery contracts  which consist of amounts due from trusts and customer receivables net of an estimated allowance for cancellation are reflected in current and long term receivables in the consolidated balance sheet 
the company estimates that deferred revenue and deferred selling costs to be recognized in for north america funeral and cemetery operations are million and million for funeral  and million and million for cemetery  respectively 
financial assurances in support of operations  the company has entered into arrangements with certain high quality surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on behalf of the company as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been used to support the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the underlying obligations these surety bonds assure are appropriately recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as deferred prearranged funeral contract revenues and deferred preneed cemetery contract revenues see notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item and prearranged funeral and cemetery activities within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of this form k for further details regarding the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
the breakdown of bonds between funeral and cemetery prearrangements  as well as surety bonds for other activities  is as follows december  prearranged funeral preneed cemetery merchandise and services preconstruction bonds supporting prearranged funeral and cemetery obligations bonds supporting prearranged business permits other bonds total bonds outstanding as the company sells prearranged funeral contracts and preneed cemetery contracts  the company intends to post surety bonds where allowed by applicable law 
the company posts the surety bond in lieu of trusting a certain amount of funds received from the customer 
the amount of the bond posted is determined by the total amount of the prearranged contract that would otherwise be required to be trusted  in accordance with applicable state law 
during and  the company recognized million and million  respectively  in cash receipts attributable to bonded sales 
surety bond premiums are paid annually and are automatically renewable  unless prior notice of cancellation  until maturity of the underlying prearranged contracts 
except for cemetery preconstruction bonds which are irrevocable  the surety companies generally have the right to cancel the surety bonds at any time with appropriate notice 
in the event a surety company were to cancel the surety bond  the company would be required to obtain replacement assurance or fund a trust for an amount generally less than the posted bond amount  unless the customer s prearranged contract has been paid in full 
a quantitative detail of this subject is discussed in the contractual  commercial and contingent commitments section included within financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the company does not believe it will be required to fund material future amounts related to these surety bonds 
the applicable florida law which allows posting of surety bonds for prearranged contracts expires december  unless the law is otherwise amended  the company plans to shift from bonding to either trust or insurance funding for prearranged funeral and cemetery programs in the state of florida in the year prearranged contracts entered into prior to december  where the company posts surety bonds will be allowed to continue to be bonded for the remaining life of those contracts 
of the total bonding proceeds received by the company for and  approximately million and million  respectively  were attributable to the state of florida 
assuming the company s prearranged funeral and cemetery sales production in florida in is consistent with production for the full year of  the pre tax forecasted cash flow impact of shifting to trusting is expected to be approximately to million lower in that year before considering the cash flow impact of contracts going atneed 
this forecast reduction in pre tax cash flow involves assumptions about the mix of preneed sales among property  merchandise and services and the appropriate levels of trusting required by florida law 
using the same general assumptions  there would also be expected an estimated cash flow decrease in years through of approximately to million per year 
non gaap financial measures the company has reported certain operating and liquidity financial measures in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that exclude certain non recurring items 
these figures should be considered non gaap financial measures and are provided to more clearly present the financial results that management uses to manage its funeral and cemetery businesses

these factors are discussed below 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein or any other forward looking statements made by the company  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to the company s business the company s ability to execute its strategic plan depends on many factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company s strategic plan is focused on reducing overhead costs  increasing cash flow  asset redeployment  and reducing debt while at the same time developing key revenue initiatives designed to generate future internal growth in its core funeral and cemetery operations without the outlay of significant additional capital 
many of the factors necessary for the company s execution of its strategic plan are beyond the company s control 
the company can give no assurance that it will be able to execute any or all of its strategic plan 
failure to execute any or all of the strategic plan could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s indebtedness limits funds available for its operations 
as of december   the company had approximately billion in debt 
the company s indebtedness may limit its ability to obtain additional financing  limit its flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its markets  require the sale of assets which it would otherwise want to retain and require the dedication of more cash flow to service its debt than it desires 
the company s ability to satisfy its indebtedness in a timely manner will be dependent on the successful execution of its long term strategic plan and the resulting improvements in its operating performance 
the company s bank credit agreement and indentures contain covenants that may prevent the company from engaging in certain transactions 
the company s bank credit agreement and indentures contain  among other things  various affirmative and negative covenants that may prevent the company from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to the company 
these covenants limit  among other things  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to borrow money  pay dividends or distributions  purchase or redeem stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  and consummate certain liens on assets 
the credit agreement also requires the company to maintain certain financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests 
although the maturity of the company s bank credit agreement brings an end to the restrictions created by it  any future credit agreements or indentures may contain terms and conditions that are more or less restrictive than those of the existing bank credit agreement and indentures 
if the company lost the ability to use surety bonding to support its prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities  the company could have to make material cash payments to fund certain trust funds 
the company has entered into arrangements with certain high quality surety companies whereby such companies agree to issue surety bonds on behalf of the company  as financial assurance and or as required by existing state and local regulations 
the surety bonds are used for various business purposes  however  the majority of the surety bonds issued and outstanding have been issued to support the company s prearranged funeral and preneed cemetery activities 
in the event the surety companies canceled or did not renew the outstanding surety bonds  the company could have to obtain replacement assurance or fund certain trust funds  which could result in material cash outflows 
furthermore  the company s future cash flows could be materially affected if the company lost access to using surety bonds for financial assurance in its normal course of business 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly competitive 
in north america and most international markets in which the company operates  the funeral and cemetery industry is characterized by a large number of locally owned  independent operations 
to compete successfully  the company s funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and high professional standards in the industry  as well as offer attractive products and services at competitive prices 
in addition  the company must market itself in such a manner as to distinguish itself from its competitors 
if it is unable to successfully compete  the company  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely effected 
the company s affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond the company s control 
in connection with the company s prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise sales  affiliated funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds 
the company s earnings and investment gains and losses on these equity securities and mutual funds are affected by financial market conditions that are beyond the company s control 
if the company s earnings from perpetual care trust funds decline  the company would experience a decline in current revenues 
if the company s earnings from other trust funds decline  the company would likely experience a decline in future revenues 
in addition  if the trust funds experienced investment losses  there would likely be insufficient funds in the trusts to cover the costs of delivering services and merchandise or maintaining cemeteries in the future 
the company would have to cover any such shortfall with cash flows  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   net unrealized depreciation in the prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trust funds amounted to million and million respectively 
the perpetual care trust funds had net unrealized appreciation of million as of december  see notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the following table summarizes the investment returns excluding fees on the company s trust funds for the last three years 
prearranged funeral trust funds cemetery merchandise and services trust funds perpetual care trust funds increasing insurance benefits related to prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts may not cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service 
the company sells price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
for prearranged funeral contracts funded through life insurance or annuity contracts  the company receives in cash a general agency commission of approximately of the total sale from the third party insurance company 
additionally  the company accrues an increasing insurance benefit associated with the contract of approximately per year to be received in cash by the company at the time the funeral service is performed 
there is no guarantee that the increasing insurance benefit will cover future increases in the cost of providing a price guaranteed funeral service  which could materially adversely affect the company s future cash flows  revenues and profit margins 
the company may not be able to joint venture or sell its international operations on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s long term strategic plan includes the joint venture or sale of its remaining international operations outside of north america in order to create cash proceeds to reduce debt 
for example  the company believes it can joint venture its french operations in if the company is unable to joint venture or sell these operations on acceptable terms or otherwise  it could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its strategic plan 
the company s foreign operations and investments involve special risks 
the company s activities in areas outside the united states are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations  including loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  nationalization  wars  insurrection and other political risks  the effects of currency fluctuations and exchange controls  such as devaluation of foreign currencies and other economic problems  and changes in laws  regulations and policies of foreign governments  including those associated with changes in the governing parties 
the company is the subject of lawsuits in florida that  if decided against it  could have a negative effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and the company may be subject to additional class action or other significant lawsuits in the future 
since december  private plaintiffs and the state of florida have brought proceedings against the company for  among other things  allegedly deceiving customers by destroying caskets and remains and overselling space in two south florida cemeteries owned by a florida operating subsidiary 
the private lawsuit is a purported class action which has not been certified but seeks substantial damages 
the state actions involve  among other things  the appointment of an examiner to oversee the remedial actions and burial processes at the two cemeteries  as well as a criminal investigation by the florida department of law enforcement agency 
the ultimate outcome of these cases cannot be determined at this time 
the company has insurance policies which are designed to limit cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to it in these matters 
if the costs or damages awarded against the company in these matters exceed the insurance coverage  if the insurance coverage is determined not to apply to these amounts  or if an insurance carrier is unable to pay  the company would have to pay them out of its own funds  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the company is in the ordinary course of business involved in other litigation proceedings 
there is a risk that one of the lawsuits that the company does not view as significant at the moment  or an additional lawsuit brought in the future  could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is the subject of securities fraud class action lawsuits that  if decided against it  could have a negative effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  numerous putative class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district courts for the southern and eastern districts of texas  on behalf of persons and entities who acquired shares of the company s common stock in the merger with equity corporation international  or eci  purchased shares of the company s common stock in the open market during the period from july  through january  referred to herein as the class period  purchased call options in the open market during the class period  sold put options in the open market during the class period  held employee stock options in eci that became options to acquire the company s stock pursuant to the eci merger  and held employee stock options to purchase the company s common stock under a plan during the class period 
these actions have been consolidated into one lawsuit in the federal court in houston  texas 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the company and three of its current or former executive officers and directors violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements and failing to disclose material information concerning the company s prearranged funeral business and other financial matters  including in connection with the eci merger 
plaintiffs allege damages based on the market loss  during the class period  of the outstanding shares  including those exchanged in the eci merger 
in october  the company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint that has not been ruled on by the court 
four similar cases were also brought in the state courts of texas by former officers  directors and shareholders of eci alleging violations of texas securities laws and statutory and common law fraud in connection with the eci merger 
the ultimate outcome of the stockholder class action and employee cases cannot be determined at this time 
the plaintiffs have not been required to quantify their claim of damages  but the company believes they are likely to seek substantial amounts 
certain insurance policies held by the company may limit the company s cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to the company in these matters 
if the legal costs or the damages awarded against the company exceed the insurance coverage  if the insurance coverage is determined not to apply to these amounts  or if an insurance carrier is unable to pay  the company would have to pay them out of its own funds  which could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risks related to the death care industry if the number of deaths in the company s markets declines  its cash flows and revenues may decrease 
the united states bureau of the census estimates that the number of deaths in the united states will increase by approximately one percent per year from to however  longer life spans could reduce the number of deaths 
if the number of deaths declines  the number of funeral services and interments performed by the company will decrease and the company  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely effected 
the growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america could result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars 
in the death care industry  there has been a growing trend in the number of cremations performed in north america as an alternative to traditional funeral service dispositions 
while cremations performed by the company in north america typically have higher gross profit margins than traditional funeral services  cremations usually result in lower revenue and gross profit dollars to the company than traditional funeral services 
in north america during  of all funeral services performed by the company were cremation cases compared to and performed in and  respectively 
in recent years the company has continued to expand its cremation memorialization products and services in several north american markets  which has resulted in higher average sales for cremation cases compared to historical levels 
the company also continues to expand its nationally branded cremation service locations called national cremation r service 
if the company is unable to successfully expand its cremation memorialization products and services or its nationally branded cremation service locations  the company  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely effected 
the funeral home and cemetery businesses are high fixed cost businesses 
the majority of the company s operations throughout the world are managed in groups called clusters 
clusters are geographical groups of funeral service locations and cemeteries that lower their individual overhead costs by sharing common resources such as operating personnel  preparation services  clerical staff  motor vehicles and preneed sales personnel 
personnel costs  the largest of the operating expenses for the company  are the costs components most beneficially affected by clustering 
the company must incur many of these costs no matter the number of funeral services or interments performed 
because the company cannot necessarily decrease these costs when it experiences declines in sales  declines in sales can cause margins  profits and cash flows to decline at a greater rate than the decline in revenues 
the funeral home and cemetery industry is highly regulated 
the company s operations are subject to regulation  supervision and licensing under numerous foreign  federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  including extensive regulations concerning trust funds  preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services  and various other aspects of our business 
the impact of such regulations varies depending on the location of the company s funeral and cemetery operations 
violations of applicable laws could result in fines or other sanctions to the company 
in addition  from time to time  governments and agencies propose to amend or add regulations  which could increase costs and decrease cash flows 
for example  foreign  federal  state  local and other regulatory agencies have considered and may enact additional legislation or regulations that could affect the death care industry 
some states and regulatory agencies have considered or are considering regulations that could require more liberal refund and cancellation policies for preneed sales of products and services  limit or eliminate the ability of the company to use surety bonding  increase trust requirements and prohibit the common ownership of funeral homes and cemeteries in the same market 
if adopted by the regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which the company operates  these and other possible proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes eight and nine to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the company historically used derivatives primarily in the form of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in combination with local currency borrowings in order to manage its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and to hedge the company s net investment in foreign assets 
the company generally does not participate in derivative transactions that are leveraged or considered speculative in nature 
the company was not a party to any derivative transactions at december  at december  and  of the company s total debt consisted of fixed rate debt at a weighted average rate of and  respectively 
the company does not have a significant investment in foreign operations that are in highly inflationary economies 
approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income excluding impairment charges and other operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies at december  at december   approximately of the company s net investment and of its operating income excluding impairment charges and other operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
marketable equity and debt securities price risk in connection with the company s prearranged funeral operations and preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales  the related funeral and cemetery trust funds own investments in equity securities and mutual funds  which are sensitive to current market prices 
cost and market values as of december  and are presented in notes four and five to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
market rate sensitive instruments interest rate and currency risk the company performs a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of interest rate and exchange rate risks on earnings 
this analysis determines the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in market rates 
in actuality  market rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast 
therefore  the adverse changes described below could differ substantially from the hypothetical change 
at december   the company was not a party to any derivative transactions 
at december   the company was party to two derivative instruments that were subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate exposures 
although the derivative instruments outstanding at december  were sensitive to market rates  they have been excluded from this analysis since they qualify and are designated as effective hedges of net foreign investments 
given this  the changes in the market values of these instruments  caused by market rates  do not affect interest expense 
therefore  the effect of the sensitivity analysis described below results solely from the company s debt instruments 
a sensitivity analysis of debt instruments with variable interest rate components was modeled to assess the impact that changing interest rates could have on pretax earnings 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous adverse change to the then prevailing interest rates with all other variables held constant 
given this model  the company s pretax earnings  on an annual basis  would not change in and would be negatively impacted by approximately thousand on december  a similar model was used to assess the impact of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies on interest expense 
at december   the company s debt exposure was primarily associated with the euro 
at december   the company s debt exposure was primarily associated with the british pound 
a adverse change in the strength of the us dollar would have negatively affected the company s interest expense  on an annual basis  by approximately thousand and thousand on december   and  respectively
