overview culp is one of the three largest marketers of upholstery fabrics for furniture as measured by total sales and one of the four largest producers of mattress fabrics known as mattress ticking  again measured by sales 
the company s fabrics are used primarily in the production of residential and commercial upholstered furniture and bedding products  including sofas  recliners  chairs  love seats  sectionals  sofa beds  office seating and mattress sets 
although culp markets fabrics at most price levels  the company emphasizes fabrics that have broad appeal in the promotional and popular priced categories of furniture and bedding 
the company s operating segments are upholstery fabrics and mattress ticking  with related divisions organized within those segments 
in upholstery fabrics  culp decorative fabrics markets jacquard and dobby woven fabrics for residential and commercial furniture 
culp velvets prints markets velvet and printed fabrics used primarily for residential furniture 
culp yarn manufactures specialty filling yarns that are primarily used by culp divisions 
in mattress ticking  culp home fashions markets a broad array of fabrics used by bedding manufacturers 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in the company s consolidated statements of income loss as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill amortization restructuring expense and asset impairments income loss from operations interest expense  net other expense loss before income taxes income taxes loss before cumulative effect of accounting change calculated as a percent of income loss before income tax restructuring actions the financial results for fiscal include a total of million in restructuring and related charges  all of which reflect previously announced restructuring initiatives in the upholstery fabrics segment 
as reflected in the financial statements for fiscal  restructuring and related charges were recorded as million in the line item restructuring expense and million in cost of sales  reducing net income by million  net of taxes or per share 
the million is made up of the following million of restructuring expenses related to the culp decorative fabrics cdf division  the largest items of which are lease termination expenses and personnel costs  million of restructuring related costs for cdf  which include inventory mark downs and equipment moving expense charged to cost of sales  and million of restructuring expenses related to further write downs of equipment in connection with the exit from the wet printed flock business by the culp velvets prints cvp division  offset by a restructuring credit of  for over accrued employee benefit and plant security costs 
the additional write down of equipment  which is a non cash item  was recorded to more closely estimate the current market value of this equipment  which has continued to deteriorate since april of the charges related to cdf  approximately million are non cash items  which relate to write downs of equipment and inventory mark downs  while the remaining million relates to cash expenditures 
fiscal cdf restructuring 
the restructuring and related charges for cdf reflect the restructuring initiative announced in august the objectives of this initiative were to lower manufacturing costs  simplify the dobby fabric upholstery line  increase asset utilization and enhance the division s manufacturing competitive position 
this restructuring plan principally involved consolidation of the division s weaving  finishing  yarn making and distribution operations by closing the facility located in chattanooga  tennessee and integrating these functions into cdf s pageland  south carolina  graham  north carolina and burlington  north carolina plants  a significant reduction in the number of stock keeping units skus offered in the dobby product line  representing about of the finished goods skus but only of sales  and a net reduction in workforce of approximately positions 
the fiscal cdf restructuring is projected to result in annual cost savings of approximately million  which began in the third quarter of fiscal approximately million of these savings relate to fixed manufacturing costs and the remaining million relate to variable manufacturing costs 
realization of the savings from lower fixed manufacturing costs was achieved upon the closing of the chattanooga  tennessee operation at the end of the second quarter 
however  while there has been progress on savings of variable manufacturing costs  the company expects the potential benefits to be realized over the next two to three fiscal quarters as operations within cdf achieve higher levels of efficiency 
the company currently estimates that the fiscal cdf restructuring will result in minimal additional charges during fiscal  most of which relate to equipment relocation costs 
exit of wet printed flock product line 
during march  the company announced that it was evaluating strategic alternatives for the capital invested in its wet printed flock upholstery fabrics product line 
management took this action because of the significant decline in sales and profitability of wet printed flocks in recent years  a decline related principally to the strength of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies as well as a shift in consumer preferences to other styles of upholstery fabrics 
in april  management approved a plan to exit the wet printed flock upholstery fabric business and has been actively seeking to sell the assets related to this product line 
the exit plan involved closing a printing facility and flocking operation within the culp velvets prints division  a reduction in related selling and administrative expenses  and termination of employees 
the company also recognized certain inventory write downs related to this product line 
the total charge from the exit plan and inventory write down was million  of which approximately million represented non cash items  consisting of a million write down of property  plant and equipment to its estimated net realizable value of million and a  write down of inventory 
the company recorded the total charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of this total  million was recorded in the line item restructuring expense and  related to the inventory write downs  was recorded in cost of sales  reducing net income by million  net of taxes or per share 
for fiscal  additional restructuring charges related to wet printed flocks were recorded as explained earlier in this report 
during the fiscal year ended april   sales of wet printed flocks contributed million  or  of the company s total sales and resulted in an operating loss of million 
the company estimates that the net loss attributable to these operations on an after tax basis was approximately per share during fiscal other restructuring actions 
during fiscal and continuing into fiscal  the company undertook a restructuring plan in its upholstery fabric segment intended to lower operating expenses  increase manufacturing utilization  raise productivity and position the company to operate profitably on a lower level of sales 
the plan involved the consolidation of certain fabric manufacturing capacity within the culp decorative fabrics cdf division  closing one of the company s four yarn manufacturing plants within culp yarn  an extensive reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses including the termination of employees and a comprehensive stock keeping unit sku reduction initiative related to finished goods and raw materials in cdf 
additionally  the plan included consolidation of the cdf design operation into the company s design center and the implementation of a common set of raw material components for cdf 
the company also recognized certain inventory write downs related to the closed facilities as part of this initiative 
the total charge from the restructuring  cost reduction and inventory write down initiatives was million  about million of which represented non cash items 
the company recognized million of restructuring and related charges during fiscal  which were recorded as million in the line item restructuring expense and million in cost of sales  reducing net income by million  net of taxes or per share 
in fiscal the company recognized million of restructuring and related charges recorded as million in the line item restructuring expense and million in cost of sales 
these restructuring and related charges reduced net income by million  net of taxes or per share 
the costs reflected in cost of sales are principally related to the relocation of manufacturing equipment 
due to this restructuring plan  the company has realized annualized reductions of at least million in fixed manufacturing costs and sg a expenses 
china initiative on march   the company announced a strategic marketing initiative to establish manufacturing and distribution operations in china 
the company s strategy is to link its customer relationships  design expertise and production technology with low cost fabric manufacturers in china in order to deliver enhanced value to its customers throughout the world 
the company is currently in the process of establishing its operations in china 
a general manager for the china operations relocated to shanghai  china in may  and is in the process of hiring a small number of additional personnel 
the company received the required business licenses in mid july the company has signed a lease on a  square foot facility and the building was ready for equipment installation and office occupancy in july along with the installation of finishing equipment  the company plans to begin doing business at the china facility during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  which is expected to include fabric inspection  testing and distribution 
limited finishing operations are anticipated to begin in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal compared with the company s net sales for fiscal decreased to million as compared with fiscal  and the company reported a net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of  or per share diluted  versus a net loss million  or share diluted  a year ago 
including the cumulative effect of accounting change  the company reported a loss of per share for fiscal restructuring and related charges and credits of million  net of tax or per share and million  net of tax or per share were included in net income for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company reported further substantial improvement in its balance sheet by reducing long term debt by million during fiscal and ended the year with million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of april   culp adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result the company recorded during the first quarter of fiscal a non operating non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes of million  or per share diluted  related to the goodwill associated with the culp decorative fabrics division 
upholstery fabric segment net sales 
upholstery fabric sales for fiscal decreased to million 
domestic upholstery fabric sales decreased million  or  to million  due primarily to overall weakness in consumer demand for upholstered furniture  and other factors discussed below 
international sales decreased to million  due primarily to the exiting of the wet printed flock fabric business in april in addition to the overall softness in demand during fiscal  the sales decrease in upholstery fabrics is attributable to the company s strategy to focus on improving the profitability of its sales mix by reducing or eliminating products generating little or no profit 
in the culp velvets prints division  the company discontinued its unprofitable wet printed flock business at the end of last fiscal year 
this product line produced annual sales in fiscal of approximately million with approximately million in operating losses 
in the cdf division  the company discontinued about half of its finished goods skus or approximately  over the last eighteen months  most of which were small volume items and were very costly to produce 
these discontinued skus include the dobby product line skus that were recently eliminated as part of the fiscal cdf restructuring 
the company expects this process of identifying and dropping its low profit items to continue into fiscal the company believes additional factors that are likely impacting upholstery fabric sales are the increasing market share of leather furniture being sold in the us  and the increase in imported fabrics  both in piece goods and cut and sewn kits 
gross profit 
in spite of weak furniture demand and the operational disruption in connection with the fiscal cdf restructuring  the upholstery fabric segment improved its gross profit dollars and margins in fiscal gross profit for fiscal was million  or  versus million  or  for fiscal restructuring related charges of million and million were included in gross profit for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the key factors behind this improvement were a more profitable sales mix  the elimination of losses related to the wet printed flock business  the increasing productivity benefits from the cdf restructuring  and the fixed cost reduction benefits from the closing of the chattanooga plant as part of the fiscal cdf restructuring 
mattress ticking segment net sales 
mattress ticking sales for fiscal decreased to million 
sales to us bedding manufacturers fell to million  while sales to international customers increased by to million 
the overall sales decrease is principally due to the weakness in consumer demand for mattresses 
additional factors that could be affecting ticking demand for the company s products from bedding manufacturers are the gradual shift by many customers to one sided mattresses  which generally require one third less mattress ticking and a growing consumer preference at the higher end of the bedding market for knitted tickings which the company does not manufacture rather than woven or printed tickings although the company has begun to source knitted tickings from an outside supplier 
gross profit 
for fiscal  the mattress ticking segment reported gross profit dollars and margins of million and  respectively  compared with million and for fiscal the principal reasons for the decline were lower sales volume and reduced production schedules  which resulted in less absorption of fixed costs  pricing pressures related to the overall competitive situation in the bedding industry  and the high cost of a european sourcing agreement 
culp home fashions entered into an agreement with a european supplier in october as part of the termination of a long term supply relationship 
the agreement required  among other things  that the company maintain a certain level of weekly purchases through the end of the second quarter of fiscal consequently  during the first and second quarters of fiscal  the company was required to source products from this supplier that were significantly more expensive than products manufactured at the company s us and canadian plants in order to meet the agreement s minimum purchase levels 
this supply agreement was concluded on october  selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses were million for fiscal and decreased million  or  from fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to from the previous year 
sg a expenses in fiscal included a credit to bad debt expense in the amount of  due to a significant decrease in past due receivable balances 
this amount compares with bad debt expense of million in the year earlier period 
additionally  sg a expenses for fiscal were lower due to reduced sampling charges and reduced sales expenses due to lower sales volume 
goodwill amortization 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal declined to million from million due to significantly lower borrowings outstanding  offset somewhat by a  increase in interest expense associated with the company s million term loan  as a result of an amendment in february interest income 
interest income increased to  from  due to significantly higher average invested cash for the year as compared with the average for the prior year 
other expense 
other expense for the fiscal totaled  compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to lower legal and debt issue expenses 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the higher rate on the pretax loss in each period reflects the benefit from a reduction in estimated accruals as well as a lower proportion of earnings in fiscal from the company s canadian subsidiary that is taxed at a lower effective rate 
compared with the company s net sales for fiscal decreased by million  or  compared with fiscal  and the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal restructuring and related charges of million  net of tax or per share and million  net of tax or per share were included in net income for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
below is additional discussion regarding segment financial performance 
upholstery fabric segment net sales 
for fiscal  upholstery fabrics sales decreased to million 
this decline was due to a  or million  decline in domestic upholstery fabric sales  and a  or million  decline in international upholstery fabric sales 
the decline in domestic upholstery fabric sales related primarily to a decline in sales to the external yarn market million  where the company discontinued producing yarns for the apparel and carpet markets  and to a decline in sales to the commercial furniture market million 
the decline in international upholstery fabric sales was caused by the company s products becoming less competitive with goods produced internationally due to the strong us dollar and additionally to a fashion trend away from wet printed flock fabrics  which have constituted a significant portion of the company s international sales 
gross profit 
for fiscal  gross profit was million  or  versus million  or  for fiscal restructuring related charges of million were included in gross profit for each of fiscal and fiscal this improvement reflected strong gross profit dollar and margin growth in culp velvets prints and culp yarn divisions 
offsetting these gains somewhat was a decrease in gross profit dollars and margin in culp decorative fabrics  which occurred in the first half of fiscal mattress ticking segment net sales 
compared with fiscal  mattress ticking sales increased to million for fiscal sales to us bedding manufacturing increased to million for fiscal international mattress ticking sales for fiscal were million  down from million in fiscal gross profit 
for fiscal  the mattress ticking segment reported gross profit dollars and margins of and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal this improvement was due primarily to continued strong manufacturing operating efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
sg a expenses were million for fiscal and decreased million  or  from fiscal the significant factors affecting the year to year comparisons were bad debt expense of million in fiscal versus  in fiscal and incentive compensation expense of million in fiscal versus in fiscal without considering these factors in both years  sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal this reflects a decrease and primarily resulted from the company s decision to reduce sg a expenses significantly as part of the restructuring plan 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal declined from million to million due to lower average borrowings outstanding and lower average interest rates over the course of the fiscal year 
interest income 
interest income increased from  to  due to the significant build up in cash and cash investments during fiscal  particularly in the fourth quarter 
other expense 
other expense for fiscal totaled million compared with million in the prior year 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with for the year earlier period 
the higher rate resulted from increased tax benefits in related to the company s loss in the us  including restructuring and related charges  and to a lower proportion of earnings from the company s canadian subsidiary  as well as the recognition in of gain from terminated life insurance contracts 
handling costs the company records warehousing costs in selling  general administrative expenses 
these costs were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
warehousing costs include the operating expenses of the company s various finished goods distribution centers  such as personnel costs  utilities  building rent and material handling equipment lease expense 
had these costs been included in cost of sales  gross profit would have been million  or in fiscal  million  or in fiscal and million  or in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and amounts available under its revolving credit line 
these sources have been adequate for day to day operating and capital expenditures 
the company expects these sources of liquidity to continue to be adequate for the foreseeable future 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of april  decreased to million from million at the end of fiscal  reflecting cash flow from operations of million for fiscal  capital expenditures of million  payments on vendor financed capital expenditures of million  debt repayment of million and stock issuance from the exercise of stock options of million 
cash flow from operations totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal  for a three year total of million 
significantly contributing to cash flow from operations for this three year period were reductions in accounts receivable and inventories totaling million  due primarily to lower sales volume and improvements in working capital management 
for fiscal  the company believes cash flow from operations will be substantially less than fiscal primarily because the company does not expect continued significant reduction in working capital reflected in each of the previous three years 
financing arrangements during fiscal  the company reduced its long term debt current maturities plus long term debt by million by repaying all of its industrial revenue bonds 
long term debt was million at april   down million from million at april  the ratio of the company s long term debt to tangible capitalization defined as long term debt plus shareholders equity minus goodwill was at fiscal year end versus at the end of last year 
the company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its loan agreements as of april  the company s long term debt at april  is totally unsecured and is comprised of a million term loan  which includes term notes from several insurance companies  with a fixed interest rate of  and a million  non interest bearing term loan with the canadian government 
additionally  the company has a million revolving credit line with a bank  including letters of credit up to million 
borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin based upon the company s debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the agreement 
as of april   there were  in outstanding letters of credit in support of inventory purchases and no borrowings outstanding under the agreement 
the credit facility expires in august the first scheduled principal payment on the million term loan is due march in the amount of million 
the canadian government loan is repaid in annual installments of approximately  per year 
commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual payment obligations and commitments in thousands thereafter total capital expenditure commitments accounts payable capital expenditures    operating leases       long term debt      total        note payment obligations by fiscal year ending april capital expenditures capital spending for fiscal was million 
this compares with million in fiscal the larger projects for fiscal were weaving modernization and a building addition at the pageland  sc facility related to the fiscal cdf restructuring and weaving expansion in the culp home fashions division 
depreciation expense for fiscal was million 
for fiscal  the company s capital expenditure budget is million  of which million is related to the company s china initiative 
depreciation expense for fiscal is estimated to be comparable with fiscal inflation the cost of certain of the company s raw materials  principally fibers from petroleum derivatives  and utility energy costs have increased somewhat  but overall operating expenses are remaining generally stable 
factors that reasonably can be expected to influence margins in the future include changes in raw material prices  trends in other operating costs and overall competitive conditions 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal  with increased sales during the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
this seasonality results from one week closings of the company s manufacturing facilities  and the facilities of most of its customers in the united states  during the first and third quarters for the holiday weeks of july th and christmas 
critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million and from bedding manufacturers approximately million 
approximately million of the company s total accounts receivable was due from international customers 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
the company continuously performs credit evaluations of its customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the company could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
inventory valuation 
the company operates as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to write downs of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory write downs is the age of the inventory 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation write downs based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using  and month categories 
while management believes that adequate write downs for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
long lived assets 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective april  sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and also resolves implementation issues related to sfas adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management reviews long lived assets  which consists of property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the value of assets and result in an impairment charge 
the company s assessment at april  indicated that the net undiscounted future operating cash flows of the company s businesses were sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived assets under sfas no 
the determination of future operating cash flows involve considerable estimation and judgment about future market conditions and future sales and profitability 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
goodwill 
as of april   culp adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for the initial application of sfas no 
 an independent business valuation specialist was engaged to assist the company in the determination of the fair market value of culp decorative fabrics  one of the company s three divisions within the upholstery fabric segment  because of the significance of the goodwill associated with the division and due to its operating performance 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 during the first quarter of fiscal the company recorded a non operating  non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million net of taxes of million  or per share diluted  related to the goodwill associated with the culp decorative fabrics division 
after the goodwill impairment charge  the company s remaining goodwill relates to the following divisions culp decorative fabrics million  culp yarn million and culp home fashions million 
the company updated its goodwill impairment test as of april  this impairment test  which was prepared by an independent business valuation specialist  did not indicate any further impairment of goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimation and judgment 
in particular  determining the fair value of a business unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
although the company believes it has based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
as a result of a continuing difficult business environment  there is a potential for further impairment of the goodwill of culp decorative fabrics 
restructuring charges 
the upholstery fabric industry continues to be under significant pressure from a variety of external forces  such as an increase in the market share of leather furniture  an increase in customers buying fabric and cut and sew fabric kits from china  increasing pricing demands  global competition and the overall weakness of the economy 
in an effort to reduce operating expenses and increase manufacturing utilization  the company has undertaken four restructuring initiatives  two within culp decorative fabrics  one related to the exit of the wet printed flock product line  which was part of the culp velvets prints division within the upholstery fabric segment  and one related to a yarn manufacturing plant within its culp yarn division  which have resulted in restructuring charges related to the remaining lease costs of the closed facilities  the write down of property  plant and equipment  workforce reduction and elimination of facilities as the company continues to scale its u 
s productive capacity in lines with demand 
severance and related charges are accrued based on an estimate of amounts that will be paid to affected employees 
asset impairment charges related to the consolidation or closure of manufacturing facilities are based on an estimate of expected sales prices for the real estate and equipment 
the exit of facilities has also resulted in charges for lease termination and losses may also result from termination of existing contracts 
the company reassesses the individual accrual requirements at the end of each reporting period 
if circumstances change  causing current estimates to differ from original estimates  adjustments are recorded in the period of change 
restructuring charges  and adjustments of those charges  are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for certain qualifying employee termination benefits 
this statement became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce the company s deferred tax assets 
management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
considerable judgment is involved in this process as ultimate realization of benefits is dependent on the generation of future taxable income 
forward looking information this report contains statements that may be deemed forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including the private securities litigation reform act of section a of the securities act of and section a of the securities and exchange act of 
such statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties 
further  forward looking statements are intended to speak only as of the date on which they are made 
forward looking statements are statements that include projections  expectations or beliefs about future events of results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact 
such statements are often but not always characterized by qualifying words such as expect  believe  estimate  plan and project and their derivatives  and include but are not limited to statements about expectations for the company s future sales  gross profit margins  sg a or other expenses  and earnings 
factors that could influence the matters discussed in such statements include the level of housing starts and sales of existing homes  consumer confidence  trends in disposable income  and general economic conditions 
decreases in these economic indicators could have a negative effect on the company s business and prospects 
likewise  increases in interest rates  particularly home mortgage rates  and increases in consumer debt or the general rate of inflation  could affect the company adversely 
in addition  strengthening of the u 
s 
dollar against other currencies could make the company s products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the united states 
also  economic and political instability in international areas could affect the company s operations or sources of goods in those areas  as well as demand for the company s products in international markets 
finally  unanticipated delays or costs in executing restructuring actions could cause the cumulative effect of restructuring actions to fail to meet the objectives set forth by management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate plus an adjustable margin under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the company s floating debt interest rate risk was eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal after the remaining industrial revenue bonds were paid 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is due primarily to a foreign subsidiary domiciled in canada and firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials in foreign currencies 
the company s canadian subsidiary uses the united states dollar as its functional currency 
the company generally does not use financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks associated with the canadian subsidiary 
however  the company generally enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts as a hedge against its exposure to currency fluctuations on firmly committed and anticipated purchases of certain machinery  equipment and raw materials 
the amount of canadian denominated sales and manufacturing costs are not material to the company s consolidated results of operations  therefore  a change in the exchange rate at april  would not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
additionally  as the company utilizes foreign currency instruments for hedging anticipated and firmly committed transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying exposure
