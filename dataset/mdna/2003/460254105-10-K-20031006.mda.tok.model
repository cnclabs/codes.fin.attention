item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing  sales and distribution we market our products through direct sales staff  representatives and distributors 
in fiscal we added a complement of field application engineers and technical sales support staff to better serve the needs of our customers for ir s proprietary products 
we believe the depth of our power management product line enhances our competitive position in the overall power semiconductor market 
in fiscal  our product sales by region  based on the location of the customer  were approximately percent from north america  percent from europe and percent from asia  which includes japan and asia pacific 
our domestic direct sales force is organized into five regional sales zones 
in europe  our products are sold through our own sales force as well as through independent sales agents and distributors 
our european sales and representative offices are in the united kingdom  sweden  finland  denmark  spain  france  italy  germany  switzerland  russia  the czech republic and hungary 
in asia  we have sales representative or liaison offices in india  japan  singapore  china  hong kong  south korea  taiwan and the philippines 
we also have sales representative or liaison offices in mexico  australia and new zealand 
for financial information about the results for our geographic areas for each of the last three fiscal years  refer to notes to the consolidated financial statements note  geographic information and foreign operations 
because many applications require products from several product groups  we have organized our product development and marketing efforts by sector and application  rather than product type 
in addition  our staff of application engineers provides customers with technical advice and support regarding the use of our products 
customers our devices are incorporated in subsystems and end products manufactured by other companies 
no single oem customer accounted for more than ten percent of our revenue for the fiscal year ended june  approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal came from sales of our products to distributors 
the following table lists some of our major customers by end market for fiscal end markets customers information technology communications alcatel  astec  artesyn technologies  cisco  delta  lucent  motorola  nortel and power one information technology computing apple  dell  fujitsu  hpq  ibm  intel  nec and sony automotive bosch  daimler chrysler  delphi  nagares  siemensvdo  temic  trw  valeo and visteon consumer electronics fujitsu  matsushita  maytag  miele  philips  samsung  sanyo and sony defense aerospace bae  boeing  honeywell  lockheed martin  northrop grumman  raytheon and tyco industrial advanced energy  american power conversion  danfoss  ela medical  emerson  itw  lincoln  schneider and zapi distributors and contract manufacturers based on revenues for fiscal distributors arrow electronics  avnet  future electronics  lintek  weikeng and zenitron contract manufacturers celestica  flextronics  jabil  sanmina sci and solectron backlog as of june   our backlog of orders was million compared to million as of june  backlog is comprised of purchase orders and customer forecast commitments scheduled to be shipped within the following twelve months 
increasingly  major customers are operating their businesses with shorter lead times and are placing their orders at shorter intervals  which tend to reduce backlog relative to future revenue 
the increase in backlog at june  is largely attributable to our acquisition of technofusion gmbh in  the success with our proprietary products  and the recent upturn in the semiconductor industry 
given adequate notice  we usually allow customers to cancel purchase orders without penalty 
the amount of backlog to be shipped during any period is dependent on various factors and can vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
research and development we conduct research and development activities to improve the performance and cost effectiveness of our product offerings in target applications 
our research and development program focuses on analog ics  advanced circuit devices and power systems and the advancement and diversification of our hexfet power mosfet and igbt product lines 
we also direct our research and development toward reducing our customers time to market and reducing the cost of their products 
our program places increasing emphasis on the development of chipsets and system level solutions that improve overall system performance and cost  and help customers to accelerate market introduction of their products 
in fiscal  and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities 
our design centers are located throughout the world  including the united states  canada  the united kingdom  italy  france  germany and singapore 
during fiscal  we achieved performance enhancements and cost reductions across our product line 
most notably  our new product introductions for fiscal included a the new xphase analog ic architecture for high end computing and communication systems that require scalable multi phase dc dc converters  b expansion of our proprietary directfet line of double density mosfets for servers  notebooks  networking and communications markets  c our imotion integrated design platform that simplifies the use of energy efficient variable speed motors in appliance and light industrial applications  d the industry s first radiation hardened power mosfet with logic level threshold voltage to provide direct interface between microprocessors and other low voltage control circuitry requiring higher voltages or currents  and e our z series of dc dc converters for satellite and aerospace applications which incorporate synchronous rectification and address low output voltage requirements 
intellectual property we have made significant investments in developing and protecting our intellectual property 
through successful enforcement of our patents  we have entered into more than license agreements  generated royalty income  and received substantial payments in settlement of litigation 
we have issued us patents and us patent applications pending including approximately provisional applications 
our power mosfet patents expire between and  with the broadest remaining in effect until and in addition  ir has issued foreign patents and foreign patent applications pending in a number of countries including applications filed under treaty 
we are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others 
we have several registered trademarks in the united states and abroad  including the trademark hexfet 
we believe that our intellectual property contributes to our competitive advantage 
we are committed to enforcing our patent rights  including through litigation  if necessary 
consistent with this policy  we have filed suits against hitachi ltd 
and affiliated companies in january and ixys corporation in june charging infringement of several of our mosfet patents see note  litigation 
our broadest power mosfet patents were subject to  and have successfully emerged from  reexamination by the united states patent and trademark office 
we currently have license agreements with the majority of power mosfet manufacturers in the united states and abroad 
in fiscal  and  we derived million  million and million of royalty revenues from license agreements  respectively 
our royalty income stream is dependent on the continued enforceability and validity of our patents  the ability of our competitors to design around our mosfet technology or develop competing technologies  and general market conditions 
the continuation of such royalties is subject to a number of risks see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition factors that may affect future results our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to material risks 
competition we encounter differing degrees of competition for our various products  depending upon the nature of the product and the particular market served 
generally  the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid price changes and product design changes 
several of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources 
we believe that we are distinguished from our competitors by our comprehensive line of power management products and ability to combine these products into compact  cost effective packages and system level solutions 
our products compete with products manufactured by others on the basis of enabling capability  performance  reliability  quality  price  delivery time to customer and service including technical advice and support 
our major competitors in analog ics and advanced circuit devices include analog devices  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  semtech and texas instruments 
our major competitors in power components include fairchild semiconductor  hitachi  infineon technologies  mitsubishi  nec  on semiconductor  phillips  stmicroelectronics  toshiba and vishay siliconix 
among typical industry competitors  our power systems products often compete with our customers as they decide whether to manufacture such products internally 
environmental matters federal  state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the storage  use and discharge of certain materials  chemicals  and gases used in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
we do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations as now in effect will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  under some of these laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if properties are contaminated or if waste is sent to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
we cannot make assurances that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment and the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as could any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
ir and rachelle laboratories  inc rachelle  a former operating subsidiary of ours that discontinued operations in  were each named a potentially responsible party prp in connection with the investigation by the united states environmental protection agency epa of the disposal of allegedly hazardous substances at a major superfund site in monterey park  california oii site 
certain prps who settled certain claims with the epa under consent decrees filed suit in federal court in may against a number of other prps  including us  for cost recovery and contribution under the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
ir has settled all outstanding claims that have arisen against it out of the oii site 
no claims against rachelle have been settled 
the company has taken the position that none of the wastes generated by rachelle were hazardous 
counsel for rachelle received another letter  dated august  from the us department of justice  directed to all or substantially all prps for the oii site  offering to settle claims against such parties for all work performed through and including the final remedy for the oii site 
the offer required a payment from rachelle in the amount of approximately million in order to take advantage of the settlement 
rachelle did not accept the offer 
in as much as rachelle has not accepted the settlement  we cannot predict whether the epa or others would attempt to assert an action for contribution or reimbursement for monies expended to perform remedial actions at the oii site 
we cannot predict the likelihood that the epa or such others would prevail against rachelle in any such action 
we maintain the position of rachelle that its wastes were not hazardous 
our insurer has not accepted liability  although it has made payments for defense costs for the lawsuit against us 
we have made no accrual for potential loss  if any  however  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we received a letter in june from a law firm representing udt sensors  inc relating to environmental contamination chlorinated solvents such as trichlorethene assertedly found in udt s properties in hawthorne  california 
the letter alleges that we operated a manufacturing business at that location in the s and or s and that we may have liability in connection with the claimed contamination 
we have made no accrual for any potential losses since there has been no assertion of specific facts on which to form the basis for determination of liability 
employees as of june   we employed approximately  people  of whom approximately  were employed in north america   in europe and in asia pacific and japan 
the only collective bargaining agreements to which we are subject apply to our employees in italy 
we have approximately employees in italy 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item legal proceedings we and certain of our directors and officers were named as defendants in three class action lawsuits filed in federal district court for the central district of california in these suits sought unspecified but substantial compensatory and punitive damages for alleged intentional and negligent misrepresentations and violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the public offering of our common stock completed in april and the redemption and conversion in june of our percent convertible subordinated debentures due they also alleged that our projections for growth in fiscal were materially misleading 
in june  the court approved a settlement and dismissal of all actions  without any payment by us or any of the defendants 
in june  we filed suit in federal district court in los angeles  california  against ixys corporation  alleging infringement of our key us patents   and  the suit sought damages and other relief customary in such matters 
in august  ixys filed an answer and counterclaim  and in february  amended its answer and counterclaim  denying infringement and alleging patent invalidity and unenforceability 
the federal district court entered a permanent injunction  effective on june   barring ixys and all persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the injunction from making  using  offering to sell or selling in  or importing into  the united states  mosfets including igbts covered by ir s us patents   and or  in august  the court of appeals for the federal circuit stayed that injunction  pending appeal on the merits 
in the federal district court  in august  following trial on damages issues  the jury awarded us million in compensatory damages 
in october  the federal district court trebled the damages  increasing the award from million to approximately million  and ruled that the company is entitled to an additional award of reasonable attorney s fees for a total monetary judgment of million 
ixys has appealed to the court of appeals  which has issued a temporary stay of the judgment pending review of the merits 
oral argument on the merits took place before the court in july and a ruling has not yet been issued 
in january  ixys filed suit in the federal northern district of california alleging infringement of its us patents     and  in the latter suit  the court dismissed all of ixys s claims  pursuant to a stipulation of the parties 
ixys has appealed the million judgment  and the ultimate outcome is contingent on the court of appeals ruling 
accordingly  we have not included any amounts related to the judgment in the current fiscal year s income as such amount represents a contingent gain per statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in january  we filed suit in the federal district court in los angeles  california  against hitachi  ltd 
and affiliated companies alleging infringement of certain of ir s us patents 
we amended our complaint in october  alleging infringement of certain other of ir s patents 
the suit sought damages and such other relief as is customary in such matters 
hitachi has denied infringement and validity of the patents and has entered a counterclaim of patent misuse 
at our request  the district court issued a preliminary injunction against certain infringing acts and  as a result of further action by the court of appeals for the federal circuit  since august   the hitachi defendants have been enjoined from making  using  offering for sale or selling in  or importing into  the united states  certain hitachi planar power mosfets 
we have recently added renesas technology corp and its us affiliate to such suit as additional parties defendant 
renesas technology corp is a joint venture comprised of hitachi percent and mitsubishi electric corporation percent 
trial in the case is scheduled for october but will likely be postponed to a later date until after a ruling has been rendered by the court of appeals on the injunction 
oral argument on the merits took place before the court in july  and a ruling has not yet been issued 
hitachi filed suit against us in the federal northern district of california in april on its us patent  the latter suit was transferred to  and has been consolidated with our suit pending in the central district of california 
the court in july granted our motion for summary judgment of non infringement of the hitachi patent 
ir and hitachi have filed suit against each other in tokyo  japan  district court alleging infringement of certain of their respective japanese patents 
the parties seek an injunction in these japanese actions

results of operations the following table sets forth certain items included in selected financial data as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal years ended june  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expense research and development expense amortization of acquisition related intangible assets impairment of assets  restructuring  severance and other charges other income  net interest income  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss fiscal compared with fiscal revenues revenues for fiscal were million  versus million in fiscal fiscal revenues reflected the growth of what we categorize as our proprietary products and the upturn in the semiconductor industry 
royalties contributed million to revenues  compared to million in fiscal for the twelve months ended june   semiconductor industry association data showed a percent growth in semiconductor industry revenues for the business in which we operate  while ir s revenues increased by percent during this period 
revenues from our proprietary products increased by percent compared to the prior fiscal year 
these revenues comprised percent of product revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to percent in the comparable prior year period 
our proprietary products refer to our analog ics  power systems and advanced circuit devices 
these products are value added or are provided under reduced competition due to their technological content or our customer relationship 
revenues from sales to original equipment manufacturers oems grew by percent from fiscal  accounting for percent of fiscal product revenues  compared to percent for fiscal we also classify revenues from sales to oems by end market applications 
compared to the prior year  revenues from all end market applications grew 
fiscal performance in end market applications is as follows the information technology sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew percent from fiscal this increase reflected greater content  the introduction of intel s centrino and pentium m based products  and an increase in market share 
the automotive sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew by percent from fiscal the revenue increase reflected new programs and the acquisition of technofusion gmbh 
technofusion contributed million and million in automotive revenues for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the consumer sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector increased by percent from fiscal  reflecting the success of energy efficient appliances and plasma hdtv 
the defense aerospace sector comprised approximately percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector grew percent from fiscal  primarily as a result of new programs including advanced aircraft  global positioning satellites and smart weaponry 
the industrial sector comprised approximately eight percent of sales to oems for fiscal revenues from this sector increased percent from fiscal our sales to distributors remained relatively unchanged from fiscal  up two percent in fiscal however  distributors sales of our products to their end customers increased percent over the same period 
inventories at our distributors decreased by over percent from fiscal  and over percent from the peak in fiscal orders for proprietary products increased percent from fiscal  and represented percent of total bookings 
we continue to secure new designs for our proprietary products and to expand proprietary products content in target applications 
gross profit margin for the twelve months ended june  and  gross profit was million and million and of revenues  respectively 
compared to the prior year  the gross profit margin decline primarily reflected continued price pressure on multi market components 
for example  the average selling price of our hexfet products  which accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal component product sales  decreased by approximately percent compared to fiscal the decline in gross margin from the prior year was partially offset by more stable pricing of our proprietary products 
selling and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended june   selling and administrative expense was percent of revenues  compared to percent of revenues in the twelve months ended june  the decline in the selling and administrative expense ratio primarily reflected a higher revenue base in fiscal and efforts to keep selling and administrative expenses down in light of the growth in revenue base 
absolute selling and administrative expenditures were million for the current fiscal year  compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
the increase primarily reflected selling commissions paid on a higher revenue base 
research and development expenses for the twelve months ended june  and  research and development expense was percent and percent of revenues  respectively 
absolute research and development expenditures were million and million for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively  reflecting increased development activities focused primarily on proprietary products 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets for the twelve months ended june  and  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was million and million  respectively 
the increase reflected the acquisition of technofusion at fiscal year end impairment of assets  restructuring  severance and other charges during the fiscal quarter ended december   we announced our restructuring initiatives 
under our restructuring initiatives  our goal was to reposition the company to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize the commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products 
our restructuring plan included consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
we also planned to lower overhead costs across our support organizations 
we estimate that charges associated with the plan will be approximately million 
these charges will consist of approximately million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million of raw material and work in process inventory  and approximately million for severance 
of the million in total charges  we expect cash charges to be million to million 
as of june   we have achieved million in annualized savings from the restructuring activities and expect to realize annualized savings of approximately million by fiscal year end  and approximately million by calendar year end  with approximately percent to percent of that savings affecting cost of goods sold 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded million in total charges  consisting of million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges  million for raw material and work in process inventory charges  and million for severance related costs 
components of the million for asset impairment  plant closure costs and other charges include the following items as we emphasize more advanced generation planar products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facilities in temecula  california to decrease significantly 
these facilities had a net book value of million and were written down by million 
it is expected that these facilities will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
as we emphasize more advanced generation trench products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in el segundo  california to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
this facility had significantly reduced production as of fiscal year end as we emphasize more advanced generation schottky products  we expect the future revenue stream from our less advanced facility in borgaro  italy to decrease significantly 
this facility had a net book value of million and was written down by million 
it is expected that this facility will continue in use until approximately december and the remaining basis is being depreciated over units of production during this period 
it is assumed that salvage value will equal disposition costs 
we are in the process of restructuring our manufacturing activities in europe 
this activity involves rationalizing our krefeld  germany facility and our swansea  wales facility 
as a result  our assembly assets in swansea  wales  with a net book value of million  were written down by million 
we are also i moving the majority of the production from our veneria  italy facility to our bombay  india facility  with targeted completion of december  and ii eliminating manufacturing activities in our oxted  england facility  which activity was substantially complete as of september the oxted  england products were transferred to our tijuana  mexico assembly facility 
we plan to eliminate the manufacturing of our non space military and aerospace products in our santa clara  california facility by july in the future  many of the current activities in these areas will be handled by subcontractors 
associated with this reduction in manufacturing activities  certain assets with a net book value of million were written down by million 
million in other miscellaneous items were charged  including million in contract termination and settlement costs and million in other impaired asset charges and relocation costs 
as a result of the restructuring initiatives  certain raw material and work in process inventories were impaired  including products that could not be completed in other facilities  materials that were not compatible with the processes used in the alternative facilities  and materials such as gases and chemicals that could not readily be transferred 
based on these factors we wrote down these inventories  with a carrying value of million  by million 
as of june   we had disposed of million of these inventories  which did not have a material impact on gross margin for the year ended 
asset impairments were calculated in accordance with sfas no 
in determining the asset groups  we grouped assets at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows were available 
in determining whether an asset was impaired we evaluated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors such as changes in strategy and technology 
the undiscounted cash flows from our initial analyses were less than the carrying amount for certain of the asset groups  indicating impairment losses 
based on this  we determined the fair value of these asset groups using the present value technique  by applying a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows that is consistent with the rate we used when analyzing potential acquisitions 
our restructuring activities were targeted to eliminate approximately percent to percent of our existing positions and are expected to result in severance charges of approximately million through december below is a table of approximate severance charges by major activity and location location activity amount el segundo  california close manufacturing facility million santa clara  california eliminate certain manufacturing activities million oxted  england close manufacturing facility million veneria  italy move manufacturing to india million company wide realign business processes million total million for the year ended june   of the million noted above  we recorded million in severance termination costs related to approximately administrative  operating and manufacturing positions  and million in costs to terminate a pension plan at our manufacturing facility in oxted  england 
the severance charges associated with the elimination of positions  which included the persons notified to date  had been and will continue to be recognized ratably over the future service period  as applicable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we measured the total termination benefits at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date 
a change resulting from a revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash over the future service period will be measured using the credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to initially measure the liability 
the cumulative effect of the change will be recognized as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 
including the liability accrued prior to our december restructuring initiatives  the accrued severance and pension liabilities as of june  are as follows in s accrued pension liability accrued severance liability total liability balance  june    costs incurred or charged to other expense costs incurred or charged to impairment of assets  restructuring  severance and other charges    purchase price adjustment to technofusion gmbh severance costs costs paid   foreign exchange impact balance  june     other income and expenses in fiscal  we reached an insurance settlement for equipment that was damaged at one of our wafer fabrication lines see note  insurance claim 
for the twelve months ended june  and  we recognized a million and million net gain on the settlement  respectively  which had been included in other income and expenses 
fiscal s gain from the insurance settlement was partially offset by a net foreign currency loss of million 
fiscal s gain was partially offset by litigation and claims settlements of million and a net foreign currency loss of million 
interest income and expenses interest income was million and million for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in income reflected lower prevailing interest rates in the current year 
interest expense was million and million for the twelve months ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease in expense reflected primarily realized savings from lower variable rate resulting from the interest rate swap transaction with jp morgan chase bank  as well as lower prevailing interest rates in the current year  partially offset by increase in expense from the lehman brothers interest rate contract see note  derivative financial instruments 
income taxes our effective tax benefit for the twelve months ended june  was approximately percent  rather than the expected us federal statutory tax benefit of percent as a result of restructuring charges  state taxes  higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain foreign losses without foreign tax benefit  partially offset by foreign tax credits and research and development credits 
our effective tax rate for the twelve months ended june  was percent  rather than the us federal statutory tax rate of percent 
the lower effective tax rate reflected foreign tax credits and research and development credits  partially offset by higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions and certain foreign losses without foreign tax benefit 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues revenues for fiscal were million  versus million in fiscal fiscal revenues were impacted by the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
for the twelve months ended june   semiconductor industry association data showed a percent decline in semiconductor industry revenues  whereas ir s revenues declined by percent during this period 
despite this challenging environment  revenues from ir s proprietary products analog ics  advanced circuit devices  and power systems grew by five percent and comprised half of product revenues in fiscal  compared to percent in royalties contributed million to revenues  compared to million in fiscal in line with the industry downturn  we experienced a percent decline compared to the prior year period in the information technology sector and a percent decline in revenues in the industrial sector for fiscal however  we returned to revenue growth in the second half of fiscal compared to the first half  with revenues increasing percent over the first half of fiscal notwithstanding the downturn  we achieved growth in several target sectors 
we strengthened our position in the defense aerospace sector by securing multiple sole source design wins in leading defense and satellite programs 
revenues from this sector grew percent over the prior year 
revenues from the consumer electronics market rose percent  reflecting increased demand for applications in high end household appliances 
including acquisitions  revenues from the automotive sector grew percent compared to fiscal excluding acquisitions  our revenue growth in the automotive sector was approximately seven percent 
orders for our proprietary products represented more than half of total bookings for fiscal orders climbed percent in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter  including bookings from technofusion 
shipments into the distribution channel declined by percent year over year  but strengthened in the fourth quarter  rising percent from the third quarter level 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we acquired the assets of european semiconductor manufacturing  ltd 
and the high reliability power mosfet line of fairchild semiconductor 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of technofusion gmbh  a leading maker of power generation products for the automotive industry  from royal philips electronics 
in total  these acquisitions contributed about million to our revenues for the fiscal year 
gross profit margin gross profit was million of revenues in fiscal  versus million of revenues in fiscal  including an inventory write down of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal strength in higher margin proprietary products helped to counter the impact of price declines  lower production volumes for components and lower royalties 
selling and administrative expenses in fiscal  selling and administrative expense was million of revenues  versus million of revenues in the comparable year ago period 
the decline in absolute spending reflected the benefits of our cost containment programs and selling commissions paid on a lower sales base and was partially offset by million from acquisitions 
expenses rose as a percentage of revenues because of lower sales compared to fiscal research and development expenses in fiscal  our research and development expenditures were million of revenues  compared to million of revenues in the prior year period 
we continue to invest in the development of new proprietary products for information technology  automotive  defense aerospace and home appliances and other motion control applications 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets in fiscal  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets was million of revenues  compared to million of revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 which eliminated the amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce 
other income and expenses in fiscal  we reached a settlement with our insurance carrier for equipment that was damaged at one of our wafer fabrication lines see note 
we recognized a million gain for the involuntary conversion of the damaged equipment 
the gain primarily represents the excess of the proceeds received and used to replace the damaged equipment over the net book value of the replaced equipment 
additionally  a resulting net gain on the settlement of the claim of million was recorded within other income and expenses 
this was partly offset by litigation and claims settlements of million and a foreign currency loss of million 
in fiscal  other income included proceeds of million related to the settlements of patent litigation 
the income reported from these settlements was net of advanced and deferred royalty payments  patent defense costs and our share of the royalty proceeds payable to unitrode corporation 
fiscal s royalty proceeds were partially offset by litigation and claims settlements of million 
interest income and expenses interest income was million and million for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively 
the fiscal figure primarily reflected the impact of lower interest rates 
interest expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease principally reflected realized savings from the million notional amount interest rate swap transaction with jp morgan chase bank see note 
income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal and was approximately percent  which differed from the us federal statutory tax rate of percent and reflected the benefits of foreign tax credits  research and development credits and state tax credits  partially offset by higher statutory tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions  foreign jurisdiction losses without foreign tax benefit  and higher state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalent balances of million and cash investments in marketable debt securities of million 
our cash  cash equivalents  cash investments in marketable debt securities and unused credit facilities of million  totaled million 
our investment portfolio consists of available for sale fixed income  investment grade securities with effective maturities of up to months 
during fiscal  operating activities generated cash flow of million compared to million in the prior year period 
non cash restructuring related charges adjusted cash flows from operations by million 
deferred income taxes primarily related to the restructuring charges adjusted cash flows from operations by million 
depreciation and amortization adjusted cash flows from operations by million 
additionally  changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash by million during fiscal  primarily related to lower receivable and inventory levels from improvements in collections and inventory management  combined with higher accrued taxes and accounts payable 
the higher accrued balances resulted from timing differences of tax payments and inventory purchases 
during fiscal  cash used in investing activities totaled million 
proceeds from sales or maturities of cash investments were million while purchases were million 
we invested million in capital expenditures primarily related to upgrading wafer manufacturing capabilities and increasing assembly capacity 
additionally at june   we had made purchase commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
we intend to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements through cash and cash equivalents on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations  and available credit facilities 
financing activities during fiscal generated million 
the issuance of common stock under our employee stock participation plan and exercise of stock options provided million 
this increase in cash was partially offset by million of debt payments 
as of june   we had revolving  equipment and foreign credit facilities of million  of which million had been utilized 
as discussed in note  we are required to obtain irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of jp morgan chase bank  for million plus a collateral requirement for the interest rate swap transaction  as determined periodically 
at june   million in letters of credit were outstanding  of which million were related to the swap transaction 
the collateral requirement of the transaction may be adversely affected by an increase in the five year libor curve  a decrease in our stock price  or both 
we cannot predict what the collateral requirement of the transaction and the letter of credit requirement will be over time 
to illustrate the potential impact had the five year libor curve increased by as much as ten percent and our stock price decreased by as much as ten percent at the close of the fiscal year  our letter of credit commitment under the jp morgan swap transaction would have remained million 
we lease certain of our administrative  research and development and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
in july  we sold million principal amount of percent convertible subordinated notes due the interest rate is percent per year on the principal amount  payable in cash in arrears semi annually on january and july the notes are convertible into shares of the ir s common stock at any time on or before july   at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction that modified our effective interest payable with respect to million of our outstanding convertible debt see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in november  we entered into a three year syndicated multi currency revolving credit facility the credit facility led by bnp paribas  which provided a credit line of million  of which up to million may be used for standby letters of credit 
the credit agreement allows borrowings by our foreign subsidiaries and provides funding for our general corporate purposes 
the facility bears interest at i local currency rates plus ii a margin between percent and percent for base rate advances and a margin of between percent and percent for euro currency rate advances 
other advances bear interest as set forth in the credit agreement 
the annual commitment fee for the credit agreement is percent of the unused portion of the credit facility 
the facility also contains certain financial and other covenants for which we were in compliance as of june  the credit facility will expire in november we are currently negotiating terms for renewal 
as of june   the following lists our contractual obligations for the next five years payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years years thereafter long term debt    capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase commitments   total       we believe that our current cash and cash investment balances  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity  including unused amounts under the million credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our currently foreseeable operating cash requirements and to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they occur in the next twelve months 
although we believe that our current financial resources will be sufficient for normal operating activities  we may also consider the use of funds from other external sources  including  but not limited to  public or private offerings of debt or equity 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january  we adopted sfas no

in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

this interpretation requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity 
it also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the voting equity investors do not have a controlling interest  or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
for arrangements entered into with vies created prior to january   the provisions of fin are required to be adopted at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january   fin becomes effective immediately 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this interpretation 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery or performance of service has occurred 
we recognize the majority of revenues upon shipment for product sales to all customers  including distributors  with provisions for estimated returns and allowances recorded at the time of shipment 
certain customers have limited rights of returns and price protection programs 
we continuously monitor product returns and potential price adjustments and record a provision for these based on notification we receive of pending credits and historical experience 
while such credits have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same predictability in estimating returns and allowances 
if the historical data and estimates we used to calculate these provisions do not properly reflect future activity  our net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could be impacted 
certain of our customers contracts contain substantive acceptance provisions 
in such circumstances  we recognize revenue in accordance with specific contract acceptance provisions  in most instances upon customer inspection or upon delivery of proof of conformance to customer specifications 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
inventories are reviewed for excess and obsolescence based upon demand forecasts within a specific time horizon and reserves are established accordingly 
long lived assets long lived assets are net property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant change in business strategy or in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant negative change in the business climate  industry conditions  economic conditions or market value of an asset  and current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on the expected undiscounted cash flows for their asset group as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  without regard to taxes 
impairments  if any  are recognized based upon the fair value of the assets 
fair value is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
we use the undiscounted cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate that is representative of the discount rate we use when evaluating potential acquisitions 
in developing our cash flow projections  we use revenue and cost assumptions based on current levels adjusted for anticipated future market conditions 
if these market conditions do not materialize  our cash flow forecasts could be materially impacted 
goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets we classify the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition as goodwill 
we classify intangible assets apart from goodwill if the assets have contractual or other legal rights or if the assets can be separated and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
depending on the nature of the assets acquired  the amortization period may range from four to twelve years for those acquisition related intangible assets subject to amortization 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets  including the related amortization period  in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the total carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization to our fair value as determined by our market capitalization 
in evaluating intangible assets subject to amortization  we assess the carrying value of each intangible asset in accordance with sfas no 
derivative financial instruments our primary objectives for holding derivative financial instruments are to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and hedge non us currency risks 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets  other long term assets or long term debt 
our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on our criteria for designation as hedging transactions  either as cash flow or fair value hedges as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 

a cash flow hedge refers to the hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of an asset or a liability  or of a forecasted transaction 
a fair value hedge refers to the hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or a liability  or of an unrecognized firm commitment 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and  in most cases  a one to one matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction 
we recognize gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes currently in earnings 
these gains and losses generally offset changes in the values of hedged assets  liabilities or debt 
for currency forward contracts  we measure the effectiveness of the hedge using forward rates to value the forward contract and the forward value of the underlying hedged transaction 
for interest rate swaps  we measure the effectiveness using regression analysis  which offsets the change in fair value of the long term debt with the change in fair value of the interest rate swap 
we recognize in current period s interest and other income and expense  depending on the nature of the underlying asset or liability  the ineffective portions of the hedge  as well as  the amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness 
if we determined that the original hedged transaction probably will not occur as anticipated  and a cash flow hedge is to be discontinued  we would reclassify the unrealized gains or losses into earnings 
we would recognize subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument in income in each period until the instrument matures  is terminated or is sold 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 we disclose the pro forma effects of recording stock based employee compensation plans at fair value on net income loss and net income loss per common share basic and diluted as if the compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements 
had we recorded the compensation expense  net income loss and net income loss per common share basic and diluted  as compared to the actual reported amounts  would approximate the following in s  except per share data net income loss  as reported    less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards    pro forma net income loss    net income loss per common share basic  as reported net income loss per common share basic  pro forma net income loss per common share diluted  as reported net income loss per common share diluted  pro forma the effects of applying sfas no 
in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts 
sfas no 
does not apply to awards prior to statement of caution under the private securities litigation reform act of this form k report includes some statements and other information that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the materials presented can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  should  view  or will or the negative or other variations thereof 
we caution that such statements are subject to a number of uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially 
factors that could affect our actual results include those set forth below under factors that may affect future results and other uncertainties disclosed in our reports filed from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect future results downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry or changes in end market demand could affect our operating results and the value of our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and the value of our business may decline during the down portion of these cycles 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past  are currently experiencing a significant and prolonged downturn and may experience such downturns in the future 
the recent downturn over the past couple of years has been severe and prolonged  and it is uncertain when any meaningful recovery might occur 
future downturns in the semiconductor industry  or any failure of the industry to recover fully from its recent downturns could seriously impact our revenues and harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although markets for semiconductors appear to be improving  we cannot assure you that they will continue to improve or that our markets will not experience renewed  possibly more severe and prolonged  downturns in the future 
in addition  we may experience significant changes in our profitability as a result of variations in sales  seasonality  changes in product mix  price competition for orders and the costs associated with the introduction of new products 
the markets for our products depend on continued demand in the communications  consumer electronics  information technology  automotive  industrial and government space markets  and these end markets may experience changes in demand that could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the failure to implement  as well as the completion and impact of our restructuring programs and cost reductions could adversely affect our business 
in december  we announced a number of restructuring initiatives 
our goal was to reposition our company to better fit the market conditions  de emphasize our commodity business and accelerate the move to what we categorize as our proprietary products 
the restructuring includes consolidating and closing certain manufacturing sites  upgrading equipment and processes in designated facilities and discontinuing production in a number of others that cannot support more advanced technology platforms or products 
the restructuring also includes lowering overhead costs across our support organization 
we cannot assure you that these restructuring initiatives will achieve their goals or accomplish the cost reductions planned 
additionally  because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business  the costs reductions could adversely affect productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated 
even if we fully execute and implement these restructuring activities  and they generate the anticipated cost savings  there may be other unforeseen factors that could adversely impact our profitability and business 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy  our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
our future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully of transforming our business to one led by our proprietary products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations 
the semiconductor business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce the value of an investment in our company 
the semiconductor industry  including the sector in which we do business  is highly competitive 
competition is based on price  product performance  product availability  quality  reliability and customer service 
price pressures may emerge as competitors attempt to gain a greater market share by lowering prices 
we compete in various markets with companies of various sizes  many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus they may be better able to pursue acquisition candidates and to withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
new technologies could result in the development of new products and a decrease in demand for our products  and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand 
our failure to develop new technologies or react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in decreased revenues and a loss of market share to our competitors 
rapidly changing technologies and industry standards  along with frequent new product introductions  characterize the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we must devote significant resources to research and development 
our financial performance depends on our ability to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner  or that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
a fundamental shift in technologies in our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position within the industry 
in addition  to remain competitive  we must continue to reduce die sizes and improve manufacturing yields 
we cannot assure you that we can accomplish these goals 
our failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain technologies may negatively affect our financial results 
our future success and competitive position may depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary technologies used in our principal products  which is achieved in part by defending claims by our competitors of intellectual property infringement 
we license certain patents owned by others 
we have also been notified that certain of our products may infringe the patents of third parties 
although licenses are generally offered in such situations  we cannot eliminate the risk of litigation alleging patent infringement 
we are currently a defendant in intellectual property litigation and we could become subject to other lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our involvement in existing and future intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense  adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor 
if any such infringements exist  arise or are claimed in the future  we may be exposed to substantial liability for damages and may need to obtain licenses from the patent owners  discontinue or change our processes or products or expend significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing technologies 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in such efforts or that such licenses would be available under reasonable terms 
our failure to develop or acquire non infringing technologies or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms or the occurrence of related litigation itself could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our ongoing protection and reliance on our intellectual property assets expose us to material risks 
we have traditionally relied on our patents and proprietary technologies 
patent litigation settlements and royalty income substantially contribute to our financial results 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights is costly  risky and time consuming 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully continue to protect our intellectual property rights  especially in foreign markets 
our key mosfet patents expire between and  although our broadest mosfet patents expire in and our royalty income is largely dependent on the following factors the remaining terms of our mosfet patents  the continuing introduction and acceptance of products that are not covered by our patents  the defensibility and enforceability of our patents  changes in our licensees unit sales  prices or die sizes  and the terms  if any  upon which expiring license agreements are renegotiated 
market conditions and mix of licensee products  as well as sales of non infringing devices can significantly affect royalty income 
any decrease in our royalty income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our international operations expose us to material risks 
we expect revenues from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
we maintain or contract with significant operations in foreign countries 
among others  the following risks are inherent in doing business internationally changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  including tax laws in the united states and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products  trade restrictions  transportation delays  work stoppages  economic and political instability  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  it is more difficult in some foreign countries to protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as is possible in the united states 
therefore  the risk of piracy or misuse of our technology and products may be greater in these foreign countries 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operating results as a result of these and other factors  we cannot assure you that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results in the future 
delays in initiation of production at new facilities  implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex  require advanced and costly equipment and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities  defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  we have from time to time experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities or in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes 
as a consequence  we have experienced delays in product deliveries and reduced yields 
we may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
interruptions  delays or cost increases affecting our materials  parts or equipment may impair our competitive position and our operations 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment  including silicon  mold compounds and leadframes  on a timely basis from third parties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of materials  parts and equipment in a timely manner or if the costs of materials  parts or equipment increase significantly 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
we have a limited number of suppliers for some materials  parts and equipment  and any interruption could materially impair our operations 
we manufacture a substantial portion of our wafer product at our temecula  california and newport  wales facilities 
any disruption of operations at those facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  some of our products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
we do not have any long term assembly agreements with these subcontractors 
as a result  we do not have immediate control over our product delivery schedules or product quality 
due to the amount of time often required to qualify assemblers and testers and the high cost of qualifying multiple parties for the same products  we could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we are forced to find alternative third parties to assemble or test them 
any product delivery delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
our operations and ability to satisfy customer obligations could be adversely affected if our relationships with these subcontractors were disrupted or terminated 
we must commit resources to product production prior to receipt of purchase commitments and could lose some or all of the associated investment 
we sell products primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or to forecast  rather than pursuant to long term supply contracts 
many of these purchase orders or forecasts may be revised or canceled without penalty 
as a result  we must commit resources to the production of products without any advance purchase commitments from customers 
our inability to sell products after we devote significant resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our levels of inventory and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and distributors 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues has come from a relatively small number of customers and distributors 
the loss or financial failure of any significant customer or distributor  any reduction in orders by any of our significant customers or distributors  or the cancellation of a significant order  could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel required to operate our business successfully 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel 
personnel with the necessary semiconductor expertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key technical  sales  marketing and managerial employees or that we will be successful in attracting  assimilating or retaining other highly qualified technical  sales  marketing and managerial personnel in the future 
if we are unable to retain existing key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are acquiring and may continue to acquire other companies and may be unable to successfully integrate such companies with our operations 
we have acquired several companies over the past three years 
we may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these companies with our operations  or if integration is more difficult than anticipated  we may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may be found to be defective  claims may be asserted against us and we may not have sufficient insurance 
one or more of our products may be found to be defective after we have already shipped the products in volume  requiring a product replacement or recall 
we may also be subject to product returns that could impose substantial costs and have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
product liability or commercial claims may be asserted with respect to our products 
although we currently have product liability or commercial insurance  we cannot assure you that we have obtained sufficient insurance coverage for all types of commercial or other losses  that we will have sufficient insurance coverage in the future or that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy any claims 
large potential environmental liabilities  including those relating to a former operating subsidiary  may adversely impact our financial position 
federal  state and local laws and regulations impose various restrictions and controls on the discharge of materials  chemicals and gases used in our semiconductor manufacturing processes 
in addition  under some laws and regulations  we could be held financially responsible for remedial measures if our properties are contaminated or if we send waste to a landfill or recycling facility that becomes contaminated  even if we did not cause the contamination 
also  we may be subject to common law claims if we release substances that damage or harm third parties 
further  we cannot assure you that changes in environmental laws or regulations will not require additional investments in capital equipment or the implementation of additional compliance programs in the future 
any failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could subject us to serious liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
some of our facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines 
our corporate headquarters  our major manufacturing facility  our research facility and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines 
we could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although we maintain earthquake insurance  we can give you no assurance that we have obtained or will maintain sufficient insurance coverage 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
semiconductor manufacturing requires a constant upgrading of process technology to remain competitive  as new and enhanced semiconductor processes are developed which permit smaller  more efficient and more powerful semiconductor devices 
we maintain certain of our own manufacturing  assembly and test facilities  which have required and will continue to require significant investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital resources to make necessary investments in manufacturing technology and equipment 
although we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  existing cash reserves and other equity or debt financings that we may obtain will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure requirements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that alternative sources of capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
terrorist attacks  such as those that took place on september   or threats or occurrences of other terrorist or related activities  whether in the united states or internationally  may affect the markets in which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate and our profitability 
future terrorist or related activities could affect our domestic and international sales  disrupt our supply chains and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products 
such activities could affect our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers  and make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive 
due to the broad and uncertain effects that terrorist attacks have had on financial and economic markets generally  we cannot provide any estimate of how these activities might affect our future results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include country risk  credit risk and legal risk and are not discussed or quantified in the following analyses  as well as risks set forth under the heading factors that may affect future results 
interest rate risk our financial assets and liabilities subject to interest rate risk are cash investments  convertible debt  credit facilities and interest rate swaps 
our primary objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
at june   we evaluated the effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on these transactions 
an adverse change of as much as ten percent in the london interbank offered rate libor or approximately basis points would have had an annualized favorable impact of approximately million on net interest income expense 
for our interest rate contract with lehman brothers  an increase of ten percent in interest rates would have had a favorable impact of million  and a decrease of ten percent in interest rates would have had an adverse impact of million  on net interest income expense 
these changes would not have had a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction the transaction with jp morgan chase bank the bank  to modify our effective interest payable with respect to million of our outstanding convertible debt the debt see notes  derivative financial instruments  and  bank loans and long term debt 
at the inception of the transaction  interest rates were lower than that of the debt and we believed that interest rates would remain lower for an extended period of time 
the variable interest rate we have paid since the inception of the swap has averaged percent  compared to a coupon of percent on the debt 
during the fiscal years ended and  this arrangement reduced interest expense by million and million  respectively 
accounted for as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the mark to market adjustments of the transaction were offset by the mark to market adjustments on the debt  resulting in no material impact to earnings 
to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship  we use a regression analysis 
to evaluate the relationship of the fair value of the transaction and the changes in fair value of the debt attributable to changes in the benchmark rate  we discount the estimated cash flows by the libor swap rate that corresponds to the debt s expected maturity date 
in addition  our ability to call the debt must be considered in assessing the effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
for those years that are projected to include at least a portion of redemption of the convertible debentures  we employ a valuation model known as a monte carlo simulation 
this simulation allows us to project probability weighted contractual cash flows discounted at the libor swap rate that corresponds to the debt s expected maturity date 
the market value of the transaction of million and million at june  and  respectively  was included in other long term assets 
in april  we entered into an interest rate contract the contract with an investment bank  lehman brothers lehman  to reduce the variable interest rate risk of the transaction 
the notional amount of the contract is million  representing approximately percent of the debt 
under the terms of the contract  we have the option to receive a payout from lehman covering our exposure to libor fluctuations between percent and percent for any four designated quarters 
the market value of the contract at june  and  respectively  was million and million  respectively  and was included in other long term assets 
interest expense was increased by mark to market losses of million and million  for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
foreign currency risk we conduct business on a global basis in several foreign currencies  and at various times  we have currency exposure related to the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
our risk to the european currencies is partially offset by the natural hedge of manufacturing and selling goods in both us dollars and the european currencies 
considering our specific foreign currency exposures  we have the greatest exposure to the japanese yen  since we have yen based revenues without the yen based manufacturing costs 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program using foreign exchange forward contracts  including the forward contract described below  to hedge certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
to protect against reductions in value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established revenue  expense and balance sheet hedging programs 
currency forward contracts and local yen and euro borrowings are used in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we considered an adverse near term change in exchange rates of ten percent for the british pound sterling  the euro and the japanese yen 
such an adverse change  after taking into account our derivative financial instruments and offsetting positions  would have resulted in an annualized adverse impact on income before taxes of less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and in march  we entered into a five year foreign exchange forward contract the forward contract for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted intercompany purchases by our subsidiary in japan 
we have designated the forward contract as a cash flow hedge under which mark to market adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity  until the forecasted transactions are recorded in earnings 
under the terms of the forward contract  we are required to exchange billion yen for million on a quarterly basis from june to march at june   quarterly payments of billion yen remained to be swapped at a forward exchange rate of yen per us dollar 
the mark to market gain of the forward contract was million and million at june  and  respectively  and was included in other long term assets 
the mark to market gain  net of tax  of million  million and million for the year ended june   and  respectively  was included in other comprehensive income 
based on effectiveness tests comparing forecasted transactions through the forward contract expiration date to its cash flow requirements  we do not expect to incur a material charge to income during the next twelve months as a result of the forward contract 
we had approximately million and million in notional amounts of forward contracts not designated as hedges at june  and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized gains losses on forward contracts recognized in earnings were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency gains losses recognized in earnings  excluding any impact from forward contracts  were less than million for the fiscal years ended june   and
