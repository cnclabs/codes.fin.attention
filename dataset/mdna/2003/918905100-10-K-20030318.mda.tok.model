critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of the customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and  the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
nl provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company owns investments in certain companies that are accounted for either as marketable securities carried at fair value or accounted for under the equity method 
for all of such investments  the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in fair value below its cost basis for marketable securities or below its carrying value for equity method investees that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
at december   the carrying value which equals their fair value of all of the company s marketable securities exceeded the cost basis of each of such investments 
with respect to the company s investment in the amalgamated sugar company llc  which represents approximately of the aggregate carrying value of all of the company s marketable securities at december   the million carrying value of such investment exceeded its million cost basis by about 
at december   the per share quoted market price of the company s investment in timet the only one of the company s equity method investees for which quoted market prices are available exceeded its per share net carrying value by about 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  impairment indicators were present only with respect to the property and equipment associated with the company s waste management operating segment  which represented approximately of the company s consolidated net property and equipment as of such date 
the company completed an impairment review of such net property and equipment and related net assets as of december  such analysis indicated no impairment was present as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with such segment exceeded the carrying value of such segment s net assets 
significant judgment is required in estimating such undiscounted cash flows 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that waste control specialists will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is required to be reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
goodwill will also be reviewed for impairment at other times during each year when impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has assigned its goodwill to three reporting units as that term is defined in sfas no 

goodwill attributable to the chemicals operating segment was assigned to the reporting unit consisting of nl in total 
goodwill attributable to the components products operating segment was assigned to two reporting units within that operating segment  one consisting of compx s security products operations and the other consisting of compx s ergonomic and slide products operations 
no goodwill impairments were deemed to exist as a result of the company s annual impairment review completed during the third quarter of  as the estimated fair value of each such reporting unit exceeded the net carrying value of the respective reporting unit nl reporting unit  compx security products reporting unit and compx ergonomic slide products reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the two compx reporting units are determined based on discounted cash flow projections  and the estimated fair value of the nl reporting unit is based upon the quoted market price for nl s common stock  as appropriately adjusted for a control premium 
significant judgment is required in estimating the discounted cash flows for the compx reporting units 
such estimated cash flows are inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that compx will achieve the future cash flows reflected in its projections 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amount recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expense  and the reported amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expense and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
o the company records an accrual for environmental  legal  income tax and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
operating income for each of the company s three operating segments are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  as summarized below o chemicals allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  goodwill and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
o component products allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
o waste management allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets and loss accruals 
in addition  general corporate and other items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for impairment of marketable securities and equity method investees  defined benefit pension and opeb plans  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
chemicals selling prices for tio  nl s principal product  were generally increasing during most of  were generally decreasing during all of and the first quarter of  were generally flat during the second quarter of and were generally increasing during the third and fourth quarters of nl s tio operations are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary kronos 
chemicals operating income  as presented below  is stated net of amortization of valhi s purchase accounting adjustments made in conjunction with its acquisitions of its interest in nl 
such adjustments result in additional depreciation  depletion and amortization expense beyond amounts separately reported by nl 
such additional non cash expenses reduced chemicals operating income  as reported by valhi  by million  million and million in  and  respectively  as compared to amounts separately reported by nl 
during and  a significant portion of such purchase accounting adjustment amortization relates to goodwill about million in and million in 
as discussed above  the decline in the aggregate amount of purchase accounting adjustment amortization from to is primarily due to ceasing the periodic amortization of goodwill beginning in years ended december  change in millions  except selling price data net sales operating income operating income margin tio data sales volumes production volumes production rate as percent of capacity full average selling price index thousands of metric tons chemicals sales increased in compared to due primarily to higher tio sales volumes  offset by lower average tio selling prices 
nl s record tio sales volumes in were higher compared to primarily due to higher volumes in european and north american markets 
by volume  approximately one half of nl s tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
the lower tio sales volumes in were due in part to the effect of the previously reported fire at nl s leverkusen  germany facility in march chemicals operating income declined in compared to as the effect of lower average ti selling prices more than offset the effect of higher ti sales and production volumes 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  nl s average tio selling prices in were lower than  with prices lower in all major regions 
while nl s average tio selling prices had generally been declining during all of and the first quarter of  and were flat during the second quarter of  average tio selling prices increased during the third and fourth quarters of nl s average tio selling prices in the fourth quarter of were higher compared to the third quarter of the year  with increases in all major markets 
nl s record tio production volumes in were higher than nl s operating rates in were lower as compared to primarily due to lost production resulting from the leverkusen fire 
chemicals sales decreased in compared to due primarily to lower tio sales volumes and lower tio average selling prices 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  nl s average tio selling prices in billing currencies during were lower compared to  with prices lower in all major regions 
nl s tio sales volumes in were lower than the prior record sales volumes of  primarily due to lower volumes in north america and europe 
chemicals operating income in decreased compared to due primarily to the lower tio sales volumes and average selling prices as well as lower tio production volumes 
nl s tio production volumes were lower in compared to the prior record production volumes in the lower production volumes in were due primarily to the effects of the leverkusen fire 
chemicals operating income in includes million of business interruption insurance proceeds as payment for losses unallocated period costs and lost margin caused by the leverkusen fire 
the effects of the lower tio sales and production volumes were offset in part by the business interruption insurance proceeds 
of such million of business interruption insurance proceeds  million was recorded as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated period costs that resulted from lost production  and the remaining million  representing recovery of lost margin  was recorded in other income 
the business interruption insurance proceeds distorts the chemicals operating income margin percentage in as there are no sales associated with the million of lost margin operating profit recognized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nl also recognized insurance recoveries of million in for property damage and related cleanup and other extra expenses related to the fire  resulting in an insurance gain of million  as the insurance recoveries exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and the cleanup and other extra expenses incurred 
such insurance gain is not reported as a component of chemicals operating income but is included in general corporate items 
nl does not expect to recognize any additional insurance recoveries related to the leverkusen fire 
pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
the average tio selling price index using of in was lower than the index of was lower than the index of 
in comparison  the index was below the price index of and higher than the price index of many factors influence tio pricing levels  including industry capacity  worldwide demand growth and customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions 
nl expects tio industry demand in will increase slightly compared to nl s tio production volumes in are expected to approximate nl s tio sales volumes 
in december and january  nl announced additional price increases in europe and north america which averaged in europe and in north america 
nl is hopeful that it will realize prices increases  but the extent to which nl can realize price increases during will depend on improving market conditions and global economic recovery  which may be negatively impacted by the potential for international conflict 
overall  nl expects its tio operating income in will be higher than  primarily due to higher average tio selling prices 
nl s expectations as to the future prospects of nl and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond nl s control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the market place  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
nl s efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
nl expects its tio production capacity will increase by about  metric tons primarily at its chloride process facilities  with moderate capital expenditures  to increase its aggregate production capacity to about  metric tons during nl has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states particularly in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of nl s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in  primarily the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
in addition  a portion of nl s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of nl s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
including the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies in decreased compared to such prices in decreased compared to 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales in by a net million compared to  and decreased tio sales in by a net million compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted nl s foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
nl s operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in compared to  and lower during compared to overall  the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on nl s operating income comparisons was not significant in and compared to the respective prior year 
component products years ended december  change in millions net sales operating income operating income margin component products sales and operating income decreased in compared to due to continued weak demand for compx s component products sold to the office furniture market resulting from the continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sectors in north america and europe 
sales of slide and ergonomic products decreased and  respectively  in compared to  and sales of security products decreased 
component products operating income comparisons were impacted by i charges aggregating million in related to the consolidation and rationalization of certain of compx s european and north american operations including headcount reductions and provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories and other items and ii charges aggregating million in related to the retooling of one of compx s manufacturing facilities and provisions for changes in estimates with respect to obsolete and slow moving inventories  overhead absorption rates and other items 
the cost savings resulting from this retooling are currently expected to begin to be reflected in compx s operating results in the first quarter of operating income comparisons were also negatively impacted by increases in certain raw material costs  primarily steel  as well as a decline in volume levels  unfavorable changes in the sales mix and general competitive pricing pressures 
operating income comparisons were favorably impacted by ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill  which amounted to approximately million in none in  as well as the impact of certain cost reductions that were implemented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
component products sales and operating income decreased in compared to due primarily to continued weak economic conditions in the manufacturing sector in north america and europe 
during  sales of slide products decreased compared to  and sales of security products and ergonomic products each decreased 
compx s efforts to reduce manufacturing  fixed overhead and related overhead costs partially offset the effect of the decline in sales  although compx was unable to sufficiently reduce such costs to fully compensate for the lower level of sales 
component products operating income in also includes the million of charges discussed above 
operating income and margins were also adversely impacted in by unfavorable changes in product mix and general pricing pressures 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states principally in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the canadian dollar  the dutch guilder  the euro and the new taiwan dollar 
in addition  a portion of compx s sales generated from its non us operations principally in canada are denominated in the us dollar 
most raw materials  labor and other production costs for such non us operations are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of compx s foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect comparability of period to period operating results 
during  the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact component products sales or operating income as compared to during  currency exchange rate fluctuations of the canadian dollar and the euro negatively impacted component products sales compared to principally with respect to slide products 
operating income comparisons for this period  however  were not materially impacted by currency fluctuations 
excluding the effect of currency  component products sales decreased in compared to compx plans to consolidate its two canadian facilities into one facility 
expenses related to this consolidation are expected to primarily consist of the cost to move machinery and equipment  and compx does not expect a significant net cost for the disposal of fixed assets 
substantial completion of this consolidation is expected by the end of the second quarter of in addition  other facility and product rationalizations are also under review and could result in additional charges for asset impairment  including goodwill  and other costs in future quarters 
compx currently expects that weak market conditions will continue in the office furniture market  the primary end use market for compx s products 
as a result  sales volumes are expected to remain depressed for at least  and competitive pricing pressures are also expected to continue 
compx has initiated price increases on certain of its products and will continue to focus on cost improvement initiatives  utilizing lean manufacturing techniques and prudent balance sheet management in order to minimize the impact of lower sales to the office furniture industry and to develop value added customer relationships with additional focus on sales of compx s higher margin ergonomic computer support systems to improve operating results 
waste management years ended december  in millions net sales operating loss waste management sales decreased in compared to due primarily to the effect of weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
waste management s operating losses declined during compared to as the effect of certain cost controls implemented in more than offset the effects of the decline in sales 
waste management operating losses increased in compared to due primarily to the effect of continued weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services  higher expenses associated with its permitting efforts and expenses associated with the start up of certain new waste disposal process equipment 
waste control specialists currently has permits which allow it to treat  store and dispose of a broad range of hazardous and toxic wastes  and to treat and store a broad range of low level and mixed radioactive wastes 
the waste management industry currently is experiencing a relative decline in the number of environmental remediation projects generating wastes 
in addition  efforts on the part of generators to reduce the volume of waste and or manage wastes onsite at their facilities also has resulted in weak demand for waste control specialists waste management services 
these factors have led to reduced demand and increased downward price pressure for waste management services 
while waste control specialists believes its broad range of permits for the treatment and storage of low level and mixed radioactive waste streams provides certain competitive advantages  a key element of waste control specialists long term strategy to provide one stop shopping for hazardous  low level and mixed radioactive wastes includes obtaining additional regulatory authorizations for the disposal of a broad range of low level and mixed radioactive wastes 
waste control specialists is continuing its attempts to increase its sales volumes from waste streams that conform to permits it currently has in place 
waste control specialists is also continuing to identify certain waste streams  and attempt to obtain modifications to its current permits  that would allow for treatment  storage and disposal of additional types of wastes 
the ability of waste control specialists to achieve increased sales volumes of these waste streams  together with improved operating efficiencies through further cost reductions and increased capacity utilization  are important factors in waste control specialists ability to achieve improved cash flows 
the company currently believes waste control specialists can become a viable  profitable operation 
however  there can be no assurance that waste control specialists efforts will prove successful in improving its cash flows 
valhi has in the past  and may in the future  consider strategic alternatives with respect to waste control specialists 
depending on the form of the transaction that any such strategic alternative might take  there can be no assurance that the company would not report a loss with respect to such a transaction 
timet years ended december  in millions timet historical net sales operating income loss boeing settlement  net fixed asset impairment tungsten accrual 
boeing take or pay income goodwill amortization other  net impairment of convertible preferred securities other general corporate  net interest expense income tax benefit expense minority interest loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle equity in losses of timet tremont accounts for its interest in timet by the equity method 
tremont s equity in earnings of timet differs from the amounts that would be expected by applying tremont s ownership percentage to timet s separately reported earnings because of the effect of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments made by tremont in conjunction with tremont s acquisitions of its interests in timet 
amortization of such basis differences generally increases earnings or reduces losses attributable to timet as reported by tremont 
in february  timet completed a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio of one share of post split common stock for each outstanding ten shares of pre split common stock 
the per share disclosures related to timet discussed below have been adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split 
implementing such reverse split had no financial statement impact to the company  and the company s ownership interest in timet did not change as a result thereof 
tremont periodically evaluates the net carrying value of its long term assets  including its investment in timet  to determine if there has been any decline in value below its amortized cost basis that is other than temporary and would  therefore  require a write down which would be accounted for as a realized loss 
at september   after considering what it believes to be all relevant factors  including  among other things  timet s then recent nyse stock prices  and timet s operating results  financial position  estimated asset values and prospects  tremont recorded a million impairment provision for an other than temporary decline in value of its investment in timet 
such impairment provision is reported as part of the company s equity in losses of timet in at december   tremont s net carrying value of its investment in timet was per share compared to a nyse market price at that date of per share 
in determining the amount of the impairment charge  tremont considered  among other things  then recent ranges of timet s nyse market price and current estimates of timet s future operating losses that would further reduce tremont s carrying value of its investment in timet as it records additional equity in losses of timet 
tremont will continue to monitor and evaluate the value of its investment in timet 
in the event tremont determines any further decline in value of its investment in timet below its net carrying value has occurred which is other than temporary  tremont would report an additional write down at that time 
excluding the effect of timet s previously reported legal settlement with boeing  its impairment charge related to certain equipment  its accruals for the tungsten matter discussed below and the effect of the boeing take or pay income  timet reported lower sales and worse operating results in compared to timet s mill and melted products sales volumes in decreased and  respectively  compared to excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  timet s average selling prices for mill products in were higher compared to  while selling prices for its melted products decreased 
timet s operating income comparisons were favorably impacted by timet ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill recognized on its separate company books  which amounted to approximately million in none in 
timet s results in were negatively impacted by an increase in timet s provision for excess inventories and severance costs related to timet s program to reduce its global employment levels 
timet s operating income comparisons were also negatively impacted in by changes in customer and product mix and lower operating rates in  with average capacity utilization declining from to 
under timet s previously reported amended long term agreement with boeing  boeing advanced timet million for each of and  and boeing is required to advance timet million annually from through the agreement is structured as a take or pay agreement such that boeing  beginning in calendar year  will forfeit a proportionate part of the million annual advance  or effectively per pound  in the event that its orders for delivery for such calendar year are less than million pounds 
timet can only be required  however  to deliver up to million pounds per quarter 
based on timet s actual deliveries to boeing of approximately million pounds during  timet recognized income of million in related to the take or pay provisions of the contract 
these earnings related to the take or pay provisions distort timet s operating income percentages as there is no corresponding amount reported in timet s sales 
timet s results in also includes a million provision for an other than temporary impairment of timet s investment in the convertible preferred securities of special metals corporation smc 
in addition  timet s effective income tax rate in varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate because timet has concluded it is not currently appropriate to recognize an income tax benefit related to its us and us losses under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
timet is the primary obligor on two workers compensation bonds issued on behalf of a former subsidiary that timet sold in the bonds were provided as part of the conditions imposed on the former subsidiary in order to self insure its workers compensation obligations 
each of the bonds has a maximum obligation of million 
the former subsidiary filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july  and discontinued payment on the underlying workers compensation claims in november during the third quarter of  timet received notices that the issuers of the bonds were required to make payments on one of the bonds with respect to certain of these claims and were requesting reimbursement from timet 
based upon current loss projections  timet anticipates claims will be incurred up to the maximum amount payable under the bond 
therefore  timet s operating results in also include a million charge for this matter 
through december   timet has reimbursed the issuer approximately  under this bond 
at this time timet understands that no claims have been paid under the second bond  and no such payments are currently anticipated 
accordingly  timet has provided no accrual for potential claims that could be filed under the second bond 
timet may revise its estimated liability under these bonds in the future as additional facts become known or claims develop 
as previously reported  in march  timet was notified by one of its customers that a product manufactured from standard grade titanium produced by timet contained what has been confirmed to be a tungsten inclusion 
timet believes that the source of this tungsten was contaminated silicon  which is used as an alloying addition to titanium at the melting stage  purchased from an outside vendor in at the present time  timet is aware of six standard grade ingots that have been demonstrated to contain tungsten inclusions 
based upon timet s assessment of possible losses  timet accrued million during for this matter 
during  the company charged  against this accrual to write down its remaining on hand inventory and made  in settlement payments  resulting in a million accrual as of december  for potential future claims 
during  timet made settlement payments aggregating  and has also revised downward its estimate of the most likely amount of loss to be incurred by  as of december   timet had million accrued for pending and potential future claims 
this amount represents timet s best estimate of the most likely amount of loss yet to be incurred 
this amount does not represent the maximum possible loss  which is not possible for timet to estimate at this time  and may be periodically revised in the future as more facts become known 
as of december  timet has received claims aggregating approximately million and has made settlement payments aggregating  pending claims are being investigated and negotiated 
timet believes that certain claims are without merit or can be settled for less than the amount of the original claim 
there is no assurance that all potential claims have yet been submitted to timet 
timet has filed suit seeking full recovery from its silicon supplier for any liability timet might incur  although no assurances can be given that timet will ultimately be able to recover all or any portion of such amounts 
timet has not recorded any recoveries related to this matter as of december  during  timet s mill products sales volumes increased compared to  and sales volumes of its melted products ingot and slab increased 
timet s average selling prices in billing currencies for its mill products increased in compared to  and melted product selling prices increased 
operating income comparisons were also impacted by the net effects of higher operating rates at certain plants  lower sponge costs  higher scrap costs  higher energy costs  changes in customer and product mix 
in addition to the boeing settlement discussed above  timet s operating results in also include a million asset impairment charge related to certain manufacturing assets and a million charge related to timet s previously reported tungsten matter discussed above 
timet s results in also include a million provision for an other than temporary impairment of timet s investment in the convertible preferred securities of smc 
in addition  timet s effective income tax rate in varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate because of a million increase in timet s deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  as timet concluded that such deferred income tax assets did not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the economic slowdown in the united states and other regions of the world in the latter part of in combination with the effects of the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted commercial air travel in the united states and abroad throughout although general economic conditions have improved relative to levels  current data indicates that commercial airline passenger traffic remains below pre attack levels  and timet expects the current slowdown in the commercial aerospace sector will continue through before beginning a modest upturn in in addition  the continuing war on terrorism and potential global conflicts could damage an already fragile economy  delay the recovery in airline passenger traffic and exacerbate the current downturn in the commercial aerospace industry 
as a result  demand for titanium in the commercial aerospace market remains soft 
in response  airlines have announced a number of actions to reduce both costs and capacity including  but not limited to  the early retirement of airplanes  the deferral of scheduled deliveries of new aircraft and allowing purchase options to expire 
the major commercial airframe and jet engine manufacturers have substantially reduced their production levels in  and the forecast of engine and aircraft deliveries over the next few years is expected to remain at these reduced levels 
timet expects that aggregate industry mill product shipments will decrease in by approximately to about  metric tons 
timet believes that demand for mill products for the commercial aerospace sector could decline by up to in  primarily due to a combination of reduced aircraft production rates and excess inventory accumulated throughout the aerospace supply chain since september  excess inventory accumulation typically leads to order demand for titanium products falling below actual consumption 
according to the airline monitor  the worldwide commercial airline industry reported an estimated operating loss of approximately billion in  compared with an operating loss of billion in and operating income of billion in the airline monitor traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast of january calls for deliveries in  deliveries in and deliveries in after  the airline monitor calls for a continued increase each year in large commercial aircraft deliveries through  with forecasted deliveries of aircraft in exceeding levels 
relative to  these forecasted delivery rates represent anticipated declines of about in  in and in deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to timet s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
timet can give no assurance as to the extent or duration of the current commercial aerospace cycle or the extent to which it will affect demand for timet s products 
although the current business environment makes it particularly difficult to predict timet s future performance  timet believes sales revenue in will remain flat compared to at approximately million to million  reflecting the combined effects of increases in sales volume offset by continued softening of market selling prices and changes in customer and product mix 
mill product sales volume is expected to increase approximately from levels to about  metric tons and melted product sales volume is expected to increase approximately relative to  to approximately  metric tons 
timet expects approximately of its mill product sales volume will be derived from the commercial aerospace sector as compared to in  with the balance from military aerospace  industrial and emerging markets 
the overall mill product sales volume increase in is principally driven by an anticipated increase in timet s military aerospace  military armor and industrial sales volume compared to  partially offset by sales volume declines in commercial aerospace and various emerging markets 
market selling prices on new orders for titanium products  while difficult to forecast  are expected to continue to soften throughout however  about one half of timet s anticipated commercial aerospace volume in is under long term agreements that provide timet with selling price stability on that portion of its business 
timet may sell substantially similar titanium products to different customers at varying selling prices due to the effect of the long term agreements  timing of purchase orders and market fluctuations 
there are also wide differences in selling prices across different titanium products that timet offers 
accordingly  the mix of customers and products sold affects the average selling price realized and has an important impact on sales revenue and gross margin 
average selling prices  as reported by timet  are a reflection not just of actual selling prices received by timet  but other related factors such as foreign currency exchange rates and customer and product mix in a given period 
consequently  changes in average selling prices from period to period will be impacted by changes occurring not just in actual prices  but in these other factors as well 
timet s operating costs are affected by a number of factors including  among others  customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor and energy costs 
raw material costs represent the largest portion of timet s manufacturing cost structure 
timet expects to manufacture a significant portion of its titanium sponge requirements in and purchase the balance 
timet expects the aggregate cost of purchased sponge and scrap to remain relatively stable in as compared to timet expects its overall capacity utilization to average about in  down from in however  timet s practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
as timet reduces production volume in response to reduced requirements  certain manufacturing overhead costs decrease at a slower rate and to a lesser extent than production volume changes  generally resulting in higher costs relative to production levels 
during  timet undertook a number of actions to reduce its costs  including reductions in employment levels  more stringent spending controls and programs to improve manufacturing yields 
however  the continued softening of market selling prices is expected to substantially offset the benefits of these actions  resulting in an expected gross margin in of between negative and break even 
timet expects gross margin to improve during the year as production volumes begin to increase somewhat 
the company anticipates that boeing will purchase about  pounds of product in at this projected order level  timet expects to recognize about million of income under the boeing lta s take or pay provisions in any such earnings will be reported as part of timet s operating income  but will not be included in its net sales  sales volume or gross margin 
timet s effective consolidated income tax rate is expected to vary significantly from the us statutory rate  as no income tax benefit is expected to be recorded on us or us losses during overall  timet presently expects to report an operating loss in of million to million and a net loss of million to million  before any potential restructuring or other special charges 
timet presently anticipates its results in the last half of will be improved compared to the first half due to the improvement in gross margins and because the estimated million expected to be earned under the take or pay provision of the boeing lta will be recognized in the last half of the year 
timet is not satisfied with the projected results for and has undertaken further cost reduction measures 
timet is redoubling its efforts to achieve aggressive spending reductions  supplier price concessions and manufacturing process improvements  and additional salaried headcount reductions are expected 
on a longer term basis  timet is continuing to evaluate product line and facilities consolidations that may permit it to meaningfully reduce its cost structure in the future while maintaining and even increasing its market share 
accordingly  timet s results in could include one or more charges for restructurings  asset impairments or similar charges that might be material 
during  timet adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under the transition provisions of sfas no 
 timet determined that the entire carrying value of its recognized goodwill at december  was impaired  and during timet recognized a million net charge recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to writeoff all of its recognized goodwill 
however  tremont had already written off all of its pro rata share of timet s recognized goodwill as part of a provision for an other than temporary impairment of its investment in timet at that time 
accordingly  timet s adoption of sfas no 
had no financial statement impact to the company during general corporate and other items general corporate interest and dividend income 
general corporate interest and dividend income decreased in compared to due to a lower average level of invested funds and lower average yields 
general corporate interest and dividend income decreased in compared to as a slightly higher level of distributions from the amalgamated sugar company llc in was more than offset by a lower interest rate on the company s million loan to snake river sugar company which rate was reduced from to effective april  and a lower average interest rate on funds available for investment 
the company received million of distributions from the llc in compared to million in and million in see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
aggregate general corporate interest and dividend income is currently expected to be lower during compared to due primarily to a lower amount of funds available for investment and lower average interest rates 
legal settlement gains 
the million of net legal settlement gains in relate to nl s settlements with certain former insurance carriers 
the million net legal settlement gains in relate principally to i settlement of certain litigation to which waste control specialists was a party million and ii nl s additional settlements with certain former insurance carriers million 
the million net legal settlement gains in relate to nl s additional settlements with certain former insurance carriers

securities transaction gains in are comprised of i a million unrealized gain related to the reclassification of  shares of halliburton company common stock from available for sale to trading securities and ii a million gain related to changes in the market value of the halliburton common stock classified as trading securities 
at december   the company held approximately  shares of halliburton common stock which were sold in market transactions in january for an amount approximating their december  carrying value 
securities transactions gains in include a million realized gain from exchanges of lyons and related to the disposition of a portion of the shares of halliburton common stock held by the company when certain holders of the company s lyons debt obligations exercised their right to exchange their lyons for such halliburton shares 
securities transactions in also include i a million gain related to the reclassification of certain shares of halliburton common stock from available for sale to trading securities  ii an million unrealized loss related to changes in market value of the halliburton shares classified as trading securities  iii valhi s sale of  halliburton shares in market transactions for an aggregate realized gain of million and iv a million charge for an other than temporary impairment of certain marketable securities held by the company

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance gain 
the insurance gain in relates to proceeds nl received related to property damage insurance coverages for the fire at its leverkusen  germany facility  as the proceeds received exceeded the carrying value of the property destroyed and cleanup and other extra costs incurred 
nl does not expect to receive any additional insurance proceeds related to the leverkusen fire 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
other general corporate income items 
the million foreign currency transaction gain in relates to the extinguishment of certain intercompany indebtedness of nl 
the gain on disposal of fixed assets in relates to the sale of certain real estate held by tremont 
the gain on sale leaseback in relates to compx s manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
general corporate expenses 
net general corporate expenses in were higher than the same periods in  as higher legal and stock compensation related expenses of nl were only partially offset by the effect of lower compensation related expenses of tremont 
net general corporate expenses in approximated net expenses in  as lower legal expenses of nl were offset by higher compensation related expenses of tremont 
nl s million of proceeds from the disposal of its specialty chemicals business unit related to its agreement not to compete in the rheological products business is being recognized as a component of general corporate income expense ratably over the five year non compete period ending in the first quarter of million recognized in each of  and 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net general corporate expenses in are currently expected to be higher compared to  in part due to the effect of lower income related to nl s non compete agreement as well as higher expected legal expenses of nl 
interest expense 
interest expense declined in compared to due primarily to lower average levels of outstanding indebtedness as well as lower average us variable interest rates 
interest expense in includes million related to the loss on early extinguishment of certain indebtedness of nl 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense declined in compared to due primarily to lower interest rates on variable rate borrowings and a lower level of outstanding indebtedness of nl and valhi  offset in part by higher levels of indebtedness at compx 
assuming interest rates do not increase significantly from year end levels  interest expense in is expected to be lower than due to the net effects of lower average levels of indebtedness of valhi parent  higher average levels of indebtedness of nl and lower average interest rates on nl indebtedness 
at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s publicly traded debt and valhi s loans from snake river sugar company  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
fixed rate outstanding indebtedness at december  and consisted primarily of valhi s lyons and nl s senior secured notes  both of which were fully retired by december   as well as valhi s loans from snake river 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was compared to an average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings of at december  and at december  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings declined slightly from december  to december  as the effect of lower average interest rates on us borrowings more than offset the effect of higher average interest rates on nl s non us borrowings 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding variable rate borrowings decreased from december  to december  due principally to the reduction in short term us interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kii has a certain amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  accordingly  nl s interest expense is also subject to currency fluctuations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
periodic cash interest payments were not required on valhi s deferred coupon lyons which were fully redeemed by december  
as a result  cash interest expense payments in the past had been lower than accrual basis interest expense 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax rates vary by jurisdiction country and or state  and relative changes in the geographic mix of the company s pre tax earnings can result in fluctuations in the effective income tax rate 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective january   the company no longer recognizes periodic amortization of goodwill 
under gaap  generally there is no income tax benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes attributable to goodwill amortization 
accordingly  ceasing to periodically amortize goodwill beginning in impacted the company s overall effective income tax rate in as compared to during  nl reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
during  tremont increased its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at the valhi consolidated level by a net million primarily because tremont concluded certain tax attributes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the provision for income taxes in also includes a million deferred income tax benefit related to certain changes in the belgian tax law 
through december   certain subsidiaries  including nl  tremont and  beginning in march  compx  were not members of the consolidated us tax group of which valhi is a member the contran tax group  and the company provided incremental income taxes on such earnings 
in addition  through december   tremont and nl were each in separate us tax groups  and tremont provided incremental income taxes on its earnings with respect to nl 
as previously reported  effective january  nl and tremont each became members of the contran tax group 
consequently  beginning in valhi no longer provides incremental income taxes on its earnings with respect to nl and tremont nor on tremont s earnings with respect to nl 
in addition  beginning in the company believes that recognition of an income tax benefit for certain of tremont s deductible income tax attributes arising during  while not appropriate under the more likely than not recognition criteria at the tremont separate company level  is appropriate at the valhi consolidated level as a result of tremont becoming a member of the contran tax group 
both of these factors resulted in a reduction in the company s consolidated effective income tax rate in compared to during  nl reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by million 
of such reduction  million related to a change in estimate of nl s ability to utilize certain german income tax attributes following the completion of a restructuring of its german operations  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in addition  nl also utilized certain tax attributes during for which the benefit had also not previously been recognized 
during  tremont increased its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance at the valhi consolidated level by a net million due primarily because tremont concluded certain tax attributes  including its net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to january  no longer met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
such net operating loss carryforwards can only be used to offset future taxable income of tremont  and may not be used to offset future taxable income of other members of the contran tax group 
during  nl reduced its deferred income tax valuation allowance by million primarily as a result of utilization of certain tax attributes for which the benefit had not been previously recognized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
also during  tremont increased its deferred income tax valuation allowance by million primarily due to its equity in losses of timet and other deductible income tax attributes arising during for which recognition of a deferred tax benefit was not considered appropriate by tremont under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
in october  a reduction in the german base income tax rate from to  effective january   was enacted 
such reduction in the german tax rate resulted in an additional net income tax expense in the fourth quarter of of million due to a revaluation of nl s german tax attributes  including the effect of revaluing certain deferred income tax purchase accounting adjustments with respect to nl s german assets 
the reduction in the german income tax rate results in an additional income tax expense because the company has recognized a net deferred income tax asset with respect to germany 
at december   nl had the equivalent of approximately million of income tax loss carryforwards in germany with no expiration date 
however  nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance against substantially all of these income tax loss carryforwards because nl currently believes they do not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the german federal government has proposed certain changes to its income tax law  including certain changes that would impose limitations on utilization of income tax loss carryforwards  that as proposed would become effective retroactively to january  since nl has provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these german tax loss carryforwards  any limitation on nl s ability to utilize such carryforwards resulting from enactment of any of these proposals would not have a material impact on nl s net deferred income tax liability 
however  if enacted  the proposed changes could have a material impact on nl s ability to fully utilize its german income tax loss carryforwards  which would significantly affect nl s future income tax expense and future german income tax payments 
minority interest 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
minority interest in nl s subsidiaries relates principally to nl s majority owned environmental management subsidiary  nl environmental management services  inc ems 
ems was established in  at which time ems contractually assumed certain of nl s environmental liabilities 
ems earnings are based  in part  upon its ability to favorably resolve these liabilities on an aggregate basis 
the shareholders of ems  other than nl  actively manage the environmental liabilities and share in of ems cumulative earnings 
nl continues to consolidate ems and provides accruals for the reasonably estimable costs for the settlement of ems environmental liabilities  as discussed below 
as previously reported  waste control specialists was formed by valhi and another entity in waste control specialists assumed certain liabilities of the other owner and such liabilities exceeded the carrying value of the assets contributed by the other owner 
since its inception in  waste control specialists has reported aggregate net losses 
consequently  all of waste control specialists aggregate  inception to date net losses have accrued to the company for financial reporting purposes  and all of waste control specialists future net income or net losses will also accrue to the company until waste control specialists reports positive equity attributable to the other owner 
accordingly  no minority interest in waste control specialists net assets or net earnings losses is reported during  and minority interest in earnings of tremont s subsidiaries in relates to treco llc  a owned subsidiary of tremont that holds tremont s interests in bmi and landwell 
in december  treco acquired the interest in treco previously held by the other owner of treco  and treco became a wholly owned subsidiary of tremont 
accordingly  no minority interest in tremont s subsidiaries was reported subsequent to december following completion of the merger transactions in which tremont became wholly owned by valhi in february  the company will no longer report minority interest in tremont s net assets or earnings

assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   all of the company s recognized prepaid pension costs relate to nl plans  and of the company s recognized accrued pension costs relates to nl plans 
substantially all of the remaining accrued pension costs at such date relates to benefits owed to certain former us employees of medite corporation  a former business unit of valhi the medite plan 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulation such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by nl to all of its plans aggregated million in  million in and million in no contributions were required to be made with respect to the medite plan during the past three years 
the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th for the nl plans and december st for the medite plan to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately of the projected benefit obligations for all of the company s defined benefit pension plans related to plans sponsored by nl  and substantially all of the remainder related to the medite plan 
of the amount attributable to plans sponsored by nl  approximately   and related to nl plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in nl plans u 
s germany canada norway medite plan the assumed long rate return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately of the plan assets for all of the company s defined benefit pension plans related to plans sponsored by nl  and the remainder related to the medite plan 
of the amount attributable to plans sponsored by nl  approximately   and related to plan assets for nl s plans in the us  germany  canada and norway  respectively 
the company uses several different long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differs from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o in the us  nl currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
o in germany  the composition of nl s plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
o in canada  nl currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
o in norway  nl currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments of approximately and  respectively 
o in the us  the medite plan assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt  through december  the average annual rate of return has been 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows nl plans u 
s germany canada norway medite plan the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels based upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because nl maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  nl expects its defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  nl expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during the expected amount of defined benefit pension expense for for the medite plan is not significant  and no contributions are currently expected to be required to be made by such plan during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amount recognized as prepaid and accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if nl had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   nl s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and nl s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if nl lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  nl s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during similar assumed changes with respect to the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the medite plan would not be significant 
opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately of the company s aggregate accrued opeb costs relate to nl  and substantially all of the remainder relates to tremont 
nl provides such opeb benefits to retirees in the us and canada 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb expense of  in   in and  in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in  million in and million in such contributions were lower in and as compared with due to nl s contribution to a trust of certain shares of common stock received by nl pursuant to the demutualization of an insurance company  the assets of which could only be used to pay for certain of nl s retiree benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the shares were sold by the trust for million in  and such proceeds were used to pay certain of nl s opeb benefits in  and the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from to in  declining to rates of between and in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and nl s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate  in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in foreign operations nl 
nl has substantial operations located outside the united states principally europe and canada for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   the functional currency of nl s german  belgian  dutch and french operations had been converted to the euro from their respective national currencies 
at december   nl had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling 
compx 
compx has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  principally slide and or ergonomic product operations in canada  the netherlands and taiwan 
as of january   the functional currency of compx s thomas regout operations in the netherlands had been converted to the euro from its national currency dutch guilders 
timet 
timet also has substantial operations and assets located in europe  principally in the united kingdom 
the united kingdom has not adopted the euro 
approximately of timet s european sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the british pound and the euro 
certain purchases of raw materials for timet s european operations  principally titanium sponge and alloys  are denominated in us dollars while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the us dollar value of timet s foreign sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations that can impact reported earnings 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows operating activities 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  non cash interest expense  asset impairment charges and unrealized securities transactions gains and losses 
non cash interest expense relates principally to valhi and nl and consists of amortization of original issue discount on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
in addition  substantially all of the proceeds resulting from nl s legal settlements in and are shown as restricted cash  and therefore such settlements had no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  equity in earnings of affiliates will generally differ from the amount of distributions received from such affiliates  and equity in losses of affiliates does not necessarily result in a current cash outlay paid to such affiliates 
the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of available for sale marketable securities and long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
similarly  nl s insurance gain in related to the property destroyed by fire at its leverkusen facility is included in the determination of net income  but the proceeds received from the insurance company for property damage reimbursements are also shown as investing activities 
investing activities 
capital expenditures are disclosed by business segment in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the estimated cost to complete capital projects in process approximated million  of which million relates to nl s ti facilities and the remainder relates to compx s facilities 
aggregate capital expenditures for are expected to approximate million million for nl  million for compx and million for waste control specialists 
capital expenditures in are expected to be financed primarily from operations or existing cash resources and credit facilities

chemicals nl industries pricing within the tio industry is cyclical  and changes in industry economic conditions can significantly impact nl s earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations is considered the primary source of liquidity for nl

at december   nl had complied with all financial covenants governing its debt agreements

to the extent that actual developments differ from nl s expectations  nl s liquidity could be adversely affected

certain of nl s us and us tax returns are being examined and tax authorities have or may propose tax deficiencies  including non income related items and interest 
nl s and ems us federal income tax returns are currently being examined by the us tax authorities  and nl and ems have granted extensions of the statute of limitations for assessments until september  based on the examination to date  nl anticipates that the us tax authorities may propose a substantial tax deficiency 
nl has received preliminary tax assessments for the years to from the belgian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies  including related interest  of approximately euro million million at december  
nl has filed protests to the assessments for the years to nl is in discussions with the belgian tax authorities and believes that a significant portion of the assessments is without merit 
nl has received a notification from the norwegian tax authorities of their intent to assess tax deficiencies of approximately kroner million million at december  relating to through nl has objected to this proposed assessment in a written response to the norwegian tax authorities 
no assurance can be given that these tax matters will be resolved in nl s favor in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and tax proceedings 
nl believes that it has provided adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
at december   nl had recorded net deferred tax liabilities of million 
nl operates in numerous tax jurisdictions  in certain of which it has temporary differences that net to deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 
nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance of million at december   principally related to germany  partially offsetting deferred tax assets which nl believes do not currently meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
at december   nl had the equivalent of approximately million of income tax loss carryforwards in germany with no expiration date 
however  nl has provided a deferred tax valuation allowance against substantially all of these income tax loss carryforwards because nl currently believes they do not meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
the german federal government has proposed certain changes to its income tax law  including certain changes that would impose limitations on the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards that  as proposed  would become effective retroactively to january  since nl has provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of the german tax loss carryforwards  any limitation on nl s ability to utilize such carryforwards resulting from enactment of any of these proposals would not have a material impact on nl s net deferred income tax liability 
however  if enacted  the proposed changes could have a material impact on nl s ability to make full annual use of its german income tax loss carryforwards  which would significantly affect nl s future income tax expense and future income tax payments 
nl has been named as a defendant  prp  or both  in a number of legal proceedings associated with environmental matters  including waste disposal sites  mining locations and facilities currently or previously owned  operated or used by nl  certain of which are on the us epa s superfund national priorities list or similar state lists 
on a quarterly basis  nl evaluates the potential range of its liability at sites where it has been named as a prp or defendant  including sites for which ems has contractually assumed nl s obligation 
nl believes it has provided adequate accruals million at december  for reasonably estimable costs of such matters  but nl s ultimate liability may be affected by a number of factors  including changes in remedial alternatives and costs  the allocation of such costs among prps and the solvency of other prps 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the upper end of the range of reasonably possible costs to nl for sites for which it is possible to estimate costs is approximately million 
nl s estimates of such liabilities have not been discounted to present value  and other than certain previously reported settlements with respect to certain of nl s former insurance carriers  nl has not recognized any insurance recoveries 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or the upper end of the range for sites for which estimates have been made  and no assurance can be given that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no estimate presently can be made 
nl is also a defendant in a number of legal proceedings seeking damages for personal injury and property damage allegedly arising from the sale of lead pigments and lead based paints 
nl has not accrued any amounts for the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation 
there is no assurance that nl will not incur future liability in respect of this pending litigation in view of the inherent uncertainties involved in court and jury rulings in pending and possible future cases 
however  based on  among other things  the results of such litigation to date  nl believes that the pending lead pigment and lead based paint litigation is without merit 
liability that may result  if any  cannot reasonably be estimated 
in addition  various legislation and administrative regulations have  from time to time  been enacted or proposed that seek to impose various obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead based paint with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products and to effectively overturn the precedent set by court decisions in which nl and other pigment manufacturers have been successful 
examples of such proposed legislation include bills which would permit civil liability for damages on the basis of market share  rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that the defendant s product caused the alleged damage  and bills which would revive actions currently barred by statutes of limitations 
nl currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes  individually and in the aggregate  should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurance that additional matters of these types will not arise in the future 
at december   nl had million in cash  equivalents and marketable debt securities held by certain special purpose trusts  the assets of which can only be used to pay for certain of nl s future environmental remediation and other environmental expenditures 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
nl periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  its dividend policy  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  nl has in the past and may in the future seek to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  nl may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals industry or other industries  as well as the acquisition of interests in related entities 
in the event of any such transaction  nl may consider using its available cash  issuing its equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing nl s existing debt 
as discussed in results of operations chemicals  nl has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of nl s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore nl s and the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates

at december   timet had over million of borrowing availability under its various worldwide credit agreements  as discussed below 
timet presently expects to generate million to million in cash flow from operations during  principally driven by reductions in working capital  especially inventory  and the deferral of the dividends on the convertible preferred securities  also as discussed below

borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of timet s us assets 
the credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends on timet s convertible preferred securities if excess availability  as defined  is less than million  limits additional indebtedness  prohibits the payment of dividends on timet s common stock if excess availability is less than million  requires compliance with certain financial covenants and contains other covenants customary in lending transactions of this type 
excess availability is defined as unused borrowing availability less certain contractual commitments such as letters of credit 
as of december   excess availability was approximately million 
timet s us credit agreement allows the lender to modify the borrowing base formulas at its discretion  subject to certain conditions 
during the second quarter of  timet s lender elected to exercise such discretion and modified timet s borrowing base formulas  which reduced the amount that timet could borrow against its inventory and equipment by approximately million 
in the event the lender exercises such discretion in the future  such event could have a material adverse impact on timet s liquidity 
timet s united kingdom subsidiary also has a credit agreement that  as amended in december  provides for borrowings limited to the lesser of pound sterling million or a formula determined borrowing base derived from the value of accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
as of december   unused borrowing availability was approximately million

timet s capital expenditures during are currently expected to be about million 
timet is involved in various environmental  contractual  product liability and other claims  disputes and litigation incidental to its business including those discussed above 
while timet s management  including internal counsel  currently believes that the outcome of these matters  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on timet s consolidated financial position  liquidity or overall trends in results of operations  all such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur in any given period  it is possible that it could have a material adverse impact on timet s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
at december   timet had accrued an aggregate of million for environmental matters  including the previously reported matter relating to the site at its nevada facility 
timet records liabilities related to environmental remediation obligations when estimated future expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by timet at its operating facilities  or a determination that timet is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites  could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known or where no estimate can presently be made 
further  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future 
at december   timet had accrued an aggregate of  for expected costs related to various legal proceedings

at december   timet had million outstanding of its convertible preferred securities that mature in such convertible preferred securities do not require principal amortization  and timet has the right to defer dividend payments for one or more quarters of up to consecutive quarters 
timet is prohibited from  among other things  paying dividends on its common stock while dividends are being deferred on the convertible preferred securities 
timet suspended the payment of dividends on its common stock during the fourth quarter of in view of  among other things  the continuing weakness in demand for titanium metals products

prior to september  timet was prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock due to restrictions contained in its us credit agreement 
in september  such us credit agreement was amended to permit timet to pay dividends on its common stock up to specified amounts provided certain specified conditions were met 
in october  timet again elected to exercise its right to defer future dividend payments on its convertible preferred securities for a period of up to consecutive quarters 
dividends will continue to accrue and interest will continue to accrue at the coupon rate on the principal and unpaid dividends 
this deferral was effective starting with timet s december  scheduled dividend payment 
timet may consider resuming payment of dividends on the convertible preferred securities once the outlook for timet s results from operations improves substantially 
since timet exercised its right to defer dividend payments  it is unable to  among other things  pay dividends on or reacquire its capital stock during the deferral period 
in september  moody s investor service downgraded its rating on timet s convertible preferred securities to caa from b  and standard poor s ratings services lowered its rating on such securities to ccc from ccc 
s p further lowered its credit rating on such securities to d after the dividend payment due on december  on the convertible preferred securities was actually deferred 
timet s ability to obtain additional capital in the future  or its ability to obtain capital on terms timet deemed appropriate  could be negatively affected by these downgrades 
timet used the proceeds from its settlement with boeing to i pay legal and other costs associated with the boeing settlement  ii pay the deferred dividends on its convertible preferred securities and iii repay a substantial portion of timet s outstanding revolving bank debt

in the normal course of business  timet investigates  evaluates  discusses and engages in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and other industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  timet may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
tremont corporation tremont is primarily a holding company which  at december   owned approximately of timet and of nl 
at december   the market value of the million shares of timet on a post reverse split basis and the million shares of nl held by tremont was approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december   tremont had million of cash on hand  and tremont had million available for borrowing under its credit facility with nl as described below 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as previously reported  in july tremont entered into a voluntary settlement agreement with the arkansas department of environmental quality and certain other prps pursuant to which tremont and the other prps will undertake certain investigatory and interim remedial activities at a former mining site located in hot springs county  arkansas 
tremont currently believes that it has accrued adequate amounts million at december  to cover its share of probable and reasonably estimable environmental obligations for these activities 
tremont currently expects that the nature and extent of any final remediation measures that might be imposed with respect to this site will be known by currently  no reasonable estimate can be made of the cost of any such final remediation measure  and accordingly tremont has accrued no amounts at december  for any such cost 
the amount accrued at december  represents tremont s best estimate of the costs to be incurred through with respect to the interim remediation measures 
tremont records liabilities related to environmental remediation obligations when estimated future expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
such accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
estimated future expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
it is not possible to estimate the range of costs for certain sites  including the hot springs county  arkansas site discussed above 
the imposition of more stringent standards or requirements under environmental laws or regulations  the results of future testing and analysis undertaken by tremont at its non operating facilities  or a determination that tremont is potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at other sites  could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
no assurance can be given that actual costs will not exceed accrued amounts or that costs will not be incurred with respect to sites as to which no problem is currently known or where no estimate can presently be made 
further  there can be no assurance that additional environmental matters will not arise in the future 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including the complexity and differing interpretations of governmental regulations  the number of prps and the prps ability or willingness to fund such allocation of costs  their financial capabilities  the allocation of costs among prps  the multiplicity of possible solutions  and the years of investigatory  remedial and monitoring activity required 
it is possible that future developments could adversely affect tremont s business  consolidated financial conditions  results of operations or liquidity 
there can be no assurances that some  or all  of these risks would not result in liabilities that would be material to tremont s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in february  tremont entered into a million reducing revolving credit facility with ems  nl s majority owned environmental management subsidiary 
such intercompany loan between ems and tremont was collateralized by million shares of nl common stock owned by tremont and was eliminated in valhi s consolidated financial statements 
in october  tremont entered into a new million revolving credit facility with nl  also collateralized by the shares of nl common stock owned by tremont  which replaced its loan from ems 
the new facility  which matures in december  is also eliminated in valhi s consolidated financial statements 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under tremont s loan facility with nl and million was available to tremont for additional borrowings 
general corporate valhi valhi s operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries nl  compx  tremont and waste control specialists 
accordingly  valhi s long term ability to meet its parent company level corporate obligations is dependent in large measure on the receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries 
nl increased its regular quarterly dividend from 
per share to 
per share in the first quarter of  and nl further increased its regular quarterly dividend to 
per share in the fourth quarter of at the current 
per share quarterly rate  and based on the million nl shares held directly or indirectly by valhi at december  including the million nl shares now held by tremont llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi  valhi would directly or indirectly receive aggregate annual regular dividends from nl of approximately million 
nl also paid an additional dividend in the fourth quarter of of per share  which aggregated million that was paid to valhi and million that was paid to tremont 
compx s regular quarterly dividend is currently 
per share 
at this current rate and based on the million compx shares held by valhi and its wholly owned subsidiary valcor at december   valhi valcor would receive annual regular dividends from compx of million 
various credit agreements to which certain subsidiaries or affiliates are parties contain customary limitations on the payment of dividends  typically a percentage of net income or cash flow  however  such restrictions in the past have not significantly impacted valhi s ability to service its parent company level obligations 
valhi has not guaranteed any indebtedness of its subsidiaries or affiliates 
to the extent that one or more of valhi s subsidiaries were to become unable to maintain its current level of dividends  either due to restrictions contained in the applicable subsidiary s credit agreements or otherwise  valhi parent company s liquidity could become adversely impacted 
in such an event  valhi might consider reducing or eliminating its dividend or selling interests in subsidiaries or other assets 
at december   valhi had million of parent level cash and cash equivalents  had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving bank credit agreement and had million of short term demand loans payable to contran 
in addition  valhi had million of borrowing availability under its bank credit facility 
during  valhi sold in market transactions million shares of halliburton common stock for an aggregate of million  and used a majority of the proceeds to reduce its outstanding indebtedness 
the terms of the amalgamated sugar company llc company agreement provide for annual base level of cash dividend distributions sometimes referred to as distributable cash by the llc of million  from which the company is entitled to a preferential share 
distributions from the llc are dependent  in part  upon the operations of the llc 
the company records dividend distributions from the llc as income upon receipt  which occurs in the same month in which they are declared by the llc 
to the extent the llc s distributable cash is below this base level in any given year  the company is entitled to an additional preferential share of any future annual llc distributable cash in excess of the base level until such shortfall is recovered 
based on the llc s current projections for  valhi currently expects that distributions received from the llc in will approximate its debt service requirements under its million loans from snake river sugar company 
certain covenants contained in snake river s third party senior debt allow snake river to pay periodic installments of debt service payments principal and interest under valhi s million loan to snake river prior to its maturity in  and such loan is subordinated to snake river s third party senior debt 
at december   the accrued and unpaid interest on the million loan to snake river aggregated million 
such accrued and unpaid interest is classified as a noncurrent asset at december  the company currently believes it will ultimately realize both the million principal amount and the accrued and unpaid interest  whether through cash generated from the future operations of snake river and the llc or otherwise including any liquidation of snake river or the llc 
following the repayment of snake river s third party senior debt in april  valhi believes it will receive significant debt service payments on its loan to snake river as the cash flows that snake river previously would have been using to fund debt service on its third party senior debt million in would then become available  and would be required  to be used to fund debt service payments on its loan from valhi 
prior to the repayment of the third party senior debt  snake river might also make debt service payments to valhi  if permitted by the terms of the senior debt 
the company may  at its option  require the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in  and the llc has the right to redeem the company s interest in the llc beginning in the redemption price is generally million plus the amount of certain undistributed income allocable to the company 
in the event the company requires the llc to redeem the company s interest in the llc  snake river has the right to accelerate the maturity of and call valhi s million loans from snake river 
redemption of the company s interest in the llc would result in the company reporting income related to the disposition of its llc interest for both financial reporting and income tax purposes 
however  because of snake river s ability to call its million loans to valhi upon redemption of the company s interest in the llc  the net cash proceeds after repayment of the debt generated by redemption of the company s interest in the llc could be less than the income taxes that would become payable as a result of the disposition 
the company routinely compares its liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows to be received from its subsidiaries  and the estimated sales value of those units 
as a result of this process  the company has in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase indebtedness in the market or otherwise  modify its dividend policies  consider the sale of interests in subsidiaries  affiliates  business units  marketable securities or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps  to increase liquidity  reduce indebtedness and fund future activities 
such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies 
the company and related entities routinely evaluate acquisitions of interests in  or combinations with  companies  including related companies  perceived by management to be undervalued in the marketplace 
these companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to the company s current businesses 
the company intends to consider such acquisition activities in the future and  in connection with this activity  may consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing the indebtedness of the company  its subsidiaries and related companies 
from time to time  the company and related entities also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests among their respective subsidiaries and related companies

in the past  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
the company has also periodically entered into currency forward contracts to either manage a nominal portion of foreign exchange rate market risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar risk associated with future sales  or to hedge specific foreign currency commitments 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than the contracts discussed below  the company was not a party to any forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments to which the company is a party at december  and interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness and certain interest bearing notes receivable 
at december   the company s aggregate indebtedness was split between of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings of fixed rate instruments and of variable rate borrowings 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility which would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  at december   all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro  and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in us dollars  the euro or the norwegian kroner 
information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using exchange rates of us dollars per euro and 
us dollars per kroner

at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of  variable rate indebtedness at such date aggregated million  which approximates fair value  with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars 
such variable rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars of the total  the euro or the norwegian kroner 
the company has an million loan to snake river sugar company at december  and such loan bears interest at a fixed interest rate of at such dates  the estimated fair value of such loan aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential decrease in the fair value of such loan resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would be approximately million at december  million 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   nl had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness and million of norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness and million of norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
certain of compx s sales generated by its canadian operations are denominated in us dollars 
to manage a portion of the foreign exchange rate market risk associated with such receivables or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales  at december  compx had entered into a series of short term forward exchange contracts maturing through january to exchange an aggregate of million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of approximately cdn per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such forward exchange contracts at december  is not material 
no such contracts were held at december  marketable equity and debt security prices 
the company is exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the marketable securities which are owned 
the fair value of such debt and equity securities at december  and including shares of halliburton common stock held by the company was million and million  respectively 
the potential change in the aggregate fair value of these investments  assuming a change in prices  would be million at december  and million at december  other 
the company believes there are certain shortcomings in the sensitivity analyses presented above  which analyses are required under the securities and exchange commission s regulations 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in interest rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
contrary to the above assumptions  changes in interest rates rarely result in simultaneous parallel shifts along the yield curve 
also  certain of the company s marketable securities are exchangeable for certain of the company s debt instruments  and a decrease in the fair value of such securities would likely be mitigated by a decrease in the fair value of the related indebtedness 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in market prices were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in market prices 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
