item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
certain statements made in this report may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  changes in general economic and business conditions that affect market demand for machine tools and related computer control systems  software products  and replacement parts  changes in manufacturing markets  adverse currency movements  innovations by competitors  quality and delivery performance by our contract manufacturers and governmental actions and initiatives including import and export restrictions and tariffs 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring expense and other expenses  net  operating loss na na license fee income  net interest expense net income loss na na fiscal compared with fiscal our net loss for the year ended october   which was more than five times greater than that reported for fiscal  was due primarily to substantially lower sales and service fees as result of a continuing decline in machine tool orders in both the us and europe 
the association for manufacturing technology  the machine tool industry s trade association  reported that in  the us dollar value of orders for machine tools decreased  and there was a corresponding deterioration in our european markets 
also contributing to the loss for fiscal were restructuring and other special charges totaling million  which consisted primarily of a non cash inventory write downs of million  which were recorded as an increase in the cost of sales  and the write off of capitalized software development costs of million  which was recorded as a restructuring expense  b severance costs of million related to personnel reductions  and c a reserve of million of which  was recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter for potential expenditures that might be required pursuant to a disputed claim regarding a terminated facility lease in the united kingdom  which is more fully discussed below 
during fiscal  we discontinued several under performing product lines  and sold the related assets  to enable us to focus our resources and technology development on our core products 
these products  known as milling machines and vertical machining centers  consist primarily of general purpose computerized machine tools for the metal cutting industry into which our proprietary ultimax r software and computer control systems have been fully integrated 
discontinued and sold were the delta tm series computer control and related dynapath tm milling machine product line  and related parts and service activities  along with press brake product lines and all tooling products related to press brake applications 
these discontinued product lines were marketed exclusively in the united states 
during fiscal  we also eliminated domestic employee positions  which we expect will result in annual cost reductions of approximately million  of which million was realized in fiscal the positions that were eliminated were those related to the discontinued product lines as well as some positions associated with our realigned and consolidated domestic sales and service operations 
we previously occupied a facility located in england under a lease that expired in april the lease required that  following expiration of the lease  we make certain repairs to the facility resulting from deterioration of the facility during the lease term 
the scope and cost of the repairs alleged by the lessor to be required evolved throughout fiscal as investigations and negotiations proceeded  and currently approximate million 
we do not agree with the amount of the lessor s claim and are vigorously contesting that claim 
our liability could be reduced by statutory limitations or by a negotiated settlement 
based upon facts presently available to us and the current status of our negotiations with the lessor  our best estimate of our ultimate liability is million  and we have established a reserve in that amount  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the following tables set forth net sales by geographic region and product category for the years ended october  and in thousands net sales and service fees by geographic region october  americas   europe   asia pacific   total   net sales and service fees by product category october  continuing products and services computerized machine tools   computer control systems and software   service parts   service fees   total   discontinued products and services   total   our total sales and service fees were million in fiscal  a million  or  decline compared to fiscal sales of computerized machine tools other than discontinued products declined million  or  compared to fiscal  reflecting the continuing global weakness in industrial equipment spending and reduced consumption of machine tools by many manufacturing companies  with the decline comprising million  million and  in the united states  europe and southeast asia  respectively 
non machine tool revenues also declined due to reduced activity levels in our market sectors  with the decline being most pronounced in the us the following table sets forth machine unit volume and average net selling price for computerized machine tools by continuing and discontinued products computerized machine tools units sold continuing products discontinued products total  average net selling price per unit in thousands continuing products discontinued products total the average net selling price per machine units of continuing products increased due to the effect of stronger european currencies when translating foreign sales for financial reporting purposes which more than offset the effect of increased discounting due to weak market conditions 
new order bookings for continuing products in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
new orders for computerized machine tools other than discontinued products declined in us dollars worldwide 
the decline  which was experienced in all of our geographic markets  reflected a sharp decrease in orders for vertical machining centers  our primary product line 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at october  gross margin for fiscal  exclusive of inventory write downs recorded in cost of sales  declined to  from in fiscal  due to the decline in our sales of vertical machining centers and our sale of approximately million in discontinued products at discounted prices 
gross margin did improve in the last three quarters of fiscal compared to the immediately preceding quarter  although the improvement was due primarily to the cost reductions implemented over the preceding eighteen months 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million were million  or  lower than those for fiscal  due to our cost reduction programs 
we expect operating expenses to be lower in as we experience a full year s benefit of cost reductions initiated in fiscal non operating items consisted of interest expense of  in fiscal  which was  or  lower than in fiscal  primarily due to reduced borrowings 
license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal and consisted of several licenses that were granted during the year 
the licensing program that resulted in these fees was effectively completed in the first quarter of fiscal and we do not expect additional license fee income in the foreseeable future 
earnings from equity investments are from our two affiliates which are accounted for using the equity method 
other expense in fiscal was not significant and in fiscal  consisted primarily of the costs of typhoon related flood damage at our manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal compared with fiscal net loss for the fiscal year ended october  was million  or 
per share  on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million  or 
per share  reported for the preceding year 
the change in our year to year results was due primarily to a significant decline in license fee income in fiscal from that reported in fiscal  and to a lesser extent  to a decrease in sales 
the following tables set forth net sales by geographic region and product category for the years ended october  and in thousands net sales and service fees by geographic region october  americas   europe   asia pacific   total   net sales and service fees by product category october  computerized machine tools   computer control systems and software   service parts   service fees   total   sales and service fees were million  for fiscal  a decrease of from the million reported for fiscal the decline in sales was due in major part to the adverse effects of a stronger us dollar when translating foreign sales for financial reporting purposes  and by a decrease in domestic sales 
when measured at constant exchange rates  sales for fiscal would have been essentially the same as domestic sales in fiscal declined by million  or  as a result of a slowing economy in most industrial sectors that began near the end of the first fiscal quarter  while sales in europe increased million in spite of the strong dollar 
sales in southeast asia declined by million  or  due to weak economic conditions in that area during fiscal net sales of computerized machine tools increased in fiscal by million compared to the prior year when measured in constant dollars but was offset by a million decline in sales of stand alone control systems 
net sales of computerized machine tools in the us declined for the full fiscal year in contrast  sales of computerized machine tools in europe  measured in constant dollars  increased for the full year 
parts and service fee revenues declined by million  or 
the decrease was exclusively in the united states and further reflects the weakening economic environment 
international sales  including export sales from the united states  approximated of consolidated sales and service fees for fiscal compared to for fiscal new order bookings for fiscal were million  compared to million for the prior year period  a decrease of 
orders were million in the first quarter of fiscal but declined to million  and million during the second  third and fourth quarter  respectively 
the decline in orders from the first quarter was the result of weak economic conditions in most industrial market sectors in the us along with a softening in the german economy 
the decline in orders was most pronounced in the united states where computerized machine tool orders declined in dollars 
this was partially offset by a increase in computerized machine tool orders in europe  measured in constant dollars 
we experienced a further decline in orders in the first quarter of fiscal reflecting the recessionary environment in our primary markets 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at october  gross profit margin declined in fiscal to from in fiscal  due primarily to the unfavorable effects of the stronger us dollar 
operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to increased costs for enhanced product development activities associated with our next generation computer control technology 
the increased operating expense for the full fiscal year combined with reduced sales and gross profit margins  resulted in an operating loss of  for fiscal as compared to an operating profit of million in the prior year 
restructuring expense of  in fiscal included a reversal of  primarily related to sub letting space in a leased facility for which a reserve was provided as part of a previous restructuring plan 
in addition  a restructuring charge of  was recorded for severance costs related to reductions in our domestic operations 
in fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of  for severance costs related to the termination of employees at our farmington hills facility in connection with the consolidation of this operation into our north american sales and service business 
license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal consisted of several licenses that were granted during the year  while the substantial license fees reported in fiscal were primarily the result of the settlement of a long standing patent infringement claim 
the licensing program that resulted in the license and litigation settlement fees has effectively been completed and we do not expect significant license fees in fiscal other expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and consisted primarily of typhoon related flood damage at our manufacturing facility in taiwan of which our insurers have denied coverage 
fiscal other expense consisted primarily of realized and unrealized currency losses associated with accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  primarily those linked to the euro  which for the most part  were not hedged during fiscal in fiscal  these accounts receivable were fully hedged 
the provision for foreign income tax in both fiscal and fiscal consists mostly of income tax expense related to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency risk management we manage our foreign currency exposure through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts see the discussion following item a 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts periodically to hedge certain forecasted inter company sales and forecasted inter company and third party purchases denominated in foreign currencies primarily the pound sterling  euro and new taiwan dollar 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
we also moderate our currency risk related to significant purchase commitments with certain foreign vendors through price adjustment agreements that provide for a sharing of  or otherwise limit  the risk of currency fluctuations on the costs of purchased products 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash generated from operations totaled million in fiscal  compared to cash used by operations of million in fiscal working capital  excluding short term debt  was million at october   compared to million at october  the decrease in working capital is attributable to a decrease in inventory of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in inventory related primarily to a planned reduction in vertical machining center units along with the reduction of discontinued models that were sold off at discounted prices 
accounts receivable decreased due to the reduction in sales combined with improved collections 
capital investments during the year consisted of normal expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased patented technology for million that will be incorporated in our proprietary computer control system 
cash used for investments was reduced by a million resulting from repayment of an investment as a result of the termination of certain agreements 
we funded these expenditures with cash flow from operations except for the acquisition of the patented technology  which was financed by the seller 
on october   we issued a secured promissory note for  to the seller of the patented technology as partial payment for the purchase 
the note bears interest at per annum and is due in four equal installments of  on march   june   july  and december  as of october   we amended our domestic bank credit agreement  extending the maturity date to december   reducing the bank s commitment to million and revising some of the financial covenants 
we must maintain a tangible net worth  exclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income as set forth in our consolidated balance sheet  of not less than million at october   million at january   april  and july  and million at october  our adjusted ebitda  as defined  for the twelve consecutive months then ending cannot be less than negative million on october   negative million on january   negative  on april   positive  on july  and positive million on october  other financial covenants were extended unchanged to december  a facility fee of  previously payable march  has been reduced to  payable june   unless we have obtained a replacement financing arrangement by then 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at october  and outstanding letters of credit were million 
on april   we obtained a million first mortgage loan on our indianapolis corporate headquarters 
the loan bears interest at a rate of and matures in april we are required to make principal payments over the seven year term of the loan  based on a twenty year amortization schedule 
the proceeds from the first mortgage loan were used to repay bank debt 
on january  we entered into a million euro credit facility with a european bank  which matures november  interest on the facility is payable at per annum or  at the company s option  above euribor for fixed rate borrowings 
although the facility is uncollaterlized  the bank reserves the right to require collateral in the event of increased risk evaluation 
borrowings outstanding under this facility at october  were million 
total debt at october  was million representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or of total capitalization  at october  we were in compliance with all loan covenants and had unused credit availability of million at october  based on our business plan and financial projections for fiscal  we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings available to us under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal although we believe that the assumptions underlying our business plan are reasonable and achievable  there are risks related to further declines in market demand and reduced sales in the us and europe and adverse currency movements that could cause our actual results to differ from our business plan 
we are also currently in discussions with lenders to replace our existing credit facility expires december with a long term credit facility in conjunction with assessing our liquidity needs for fiscal and beyond 
while we believe we will be able to obtain a replacement facility under acceptable terms  no such assurance can be given 
contractual obligations and commitments the following is a table of contractual obligations and commitments as of october  all amounts in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt     operating leases   letters of credit   total     in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed above  we also have a variety of other contractual agreements related to the procurement of materials and services and other commitments 
with respect to these agreements  we are not subject to any contracts which commit us to material non cancelable commitments 
while some of these contractual agreements are long term supply agreements  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements which are not needed to meet production needs 
we have no material minimum purchase commitments or take or pay type agreements or arrangements 
with respect to capital expenditures  we expect capital spending in fiscal to approximate million 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 business combinations sfas and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under sfas  amortization of goodwill will cease and the goodwill carrying values will be tested periodically for impairment 
we are required to adopt sfas  effective november  for goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july  goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  were subject immediately to the goodwill non amortization and intangible provisions of this statement 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which is effective for the fiscal year beginning november  sfas establishes a single model to account for impairment of assets to be held or disposed of  incorporating guidelines for accounting and disclosure of discontinued operations 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard  which is effective for disposal activities initiated after december   addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
we will comply with the provisions of the standard with respect to exit and disposal activities initiated after the effective date  but do not expect adoption to have any material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
we do not expect the impact of adopting the interpretation to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies  including those described below  require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment because ownership and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time and payment terms are fixed 
our computerized machine tools are general purpose computer controlled machine tools that are typically used in stand alone operations 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss are not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance 
prior to shipment  we test each machine to ensure the machine s compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our sales literature 
depending upon geographic location  the machine installation at the end user may be completed by a distributor  independent contractor or hurco service technician 
in most instances where a machine is sold through a distributor  we have no installation involvement 
if sales are direct or through sales agents  we will typically complete the machine installation 
the machine installation consists of the reassembly of certain parts that were removed for shipping and the re testing of the machine to ensure that it is performing with the standard specifications 
we consider the machine installation process inconsequential and perfunctory 
service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a pro rata basis over the term of the contract 
sales related to software products are recognized when shipped in conformity with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition 
inventories we must determine at each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
reserves are established to effectively adjust any such inventory to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
deferred tax asset valuation as of october   we have deferred tax assets of million for which we have recorded a valuation allowance of resulting in zero net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
these future tax benefits relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions as well as federal business tax credits carried forward in the united states 
some of these carryforward benefits expire at certain dates and utilization of certain others is limited to specific amounts each year 
realization of those benefits is entirely dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable earnings in the specific tax jurisdictions before they expire 
due to the recent losses in the united states and the applicable foreign tax jurisdictions  there is substantial uncertainty whether these tax benefits can be utilized before they expire 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance 
the need for this allowance is reviewed periodically  and if reduced in future periods  the associated tax benefits will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of income tax expense 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred to develop new computer software products and significant enhancements to software features of existing products are capitalized as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and amortized over the estimated product life of the related software 
the determination as to when in the product development cycle technological feasibility has been established  and the expected product life  require judgments and estimates by management and can be affected by technological developments  innovations by competitors and changes in market conditions affecting demand 
we capitalized  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal related to software development projects 
also in fiscal we wrote off million of previously capitalized costs related to a discontinued product line 
at october  we have an asset of million for capitalized software development projects  a significant portion of which relates to projects currently in process and subject to development risk and market acceptance 
we periodically review the carrying values of these assets and make judgments as to ultimate realization considering the above mentioned risk factors 
derivative financial instruments critical aspects of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments include conditions which require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction 
another important element of the policy demands that formal documentation be maintained as required by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings 
we routinely monitor significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments associated with derivative instruments  and compliance with formal documentation requirements 
stock compensation we apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock based compensation  therefore  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options as options are granted at fair market value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation provides an alternative method of accounting for stock options based on an option pricing model  such as black scholes 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
information and assumptions regarding compensation expense under the alternative method is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest expense on our outstanding debt  all of which is subject to floating rates  either libor or prime 
if market interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings were to have increased by one percentage point or basis points over the actual rates paid in that year  interest expense would have increased by  in fiscal and  in fiscal this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in other factors affecting our financial statements that might result from changes in the economic environment which impact interest rates 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the interest rates related to our current credit facilities 
at october   outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facilities were million and our total indebtedness was million 
foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all of our computerized machine tools and computer control systems  as well as certain proprietary service parts  are sourced by our us based engineering and manufacturing division and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  or overseas contract manufacturers 
these purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in some cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements  which reduce but do not eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs 
the predominant portion of our exchange rate risk associated with product purchases relates to the new taiwan dollar 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecast inter company sales  and forecast inter company and third party purchases denominated in  or based on  foreign currencies 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of october  which are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no
