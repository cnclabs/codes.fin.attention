item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since commencing operations in  we have been principally engaged in the research and development of our product candidates  as well as seeking various regulatory clearances and patent protection 
we have had no revenues from sales of our products and have incurred cumulative losses since inception through december  aggregating approximately million 
we expect continued operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to support research and development efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates 
our initial product candidate  ms  is currently our only product candidate undergoing human clinical trials 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application for ms in july we initiated a phase i clinical trial in and a phase i dose escalation study in  both of which have been completed 
we completed a phase ii clinical trial in june to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of ms enhanced magnetic resonance angiography  or mra  for the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease and also completed a phase ii trial in june that was designed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of five different doses of ms enhanced mra with that of x ray angiography in the aortoiliac arteries 
in  we completed enrollment in the first study of a two arm phase iii clinical trial  which was initiated in june  and was designed to determine the efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the detection of aortoiliac occlusive disease 
we announced the results of this trial in march in october  we announced that we had completed patient enrollment in the second of the two trials designed to detect peripheral vascular disease in the aortoiliac arteries 
we announced results of this trial in march in september  after discussions with the fda  we expanded our initial target indication for ms beyond aortoiliac occlusive disease to a broad peripheral vascular disease indication  which we expect will include the entire vasculature except for the heart 
as a result of this expansion  we added two new phase iii trials to our phase iii clinical trial program  one currently in the renal kidney arteries and one in the pedal feet arteries 
in february  we announced that we had completed patient enrollment in these studies 
we plan to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the fda in in march  we completed enrollment in a phase ii clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of ms for detecting breast cancer  and in march  we completed enrollment in a phase ii feasibility trial  which we conducted in collaboration with pfizer  inc to explore the efficacy of ms enhanced mra in the diagnosis of female sexual arousal dysfunction 
in april  to complete our safety database for our nda submission  we closed our ms enhanced mra phase ii feasibility trial for coronary artery disease 
we anticipate fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to several factors  including the timing of fees and milestone payments received from strategic partners  the formation of new strategic alliances between us and third parties  the timing of expenditures in connection with research and development activities  the timing of product introductions and associated launch  marketing and sales activities  and the timing and extent of product acceptance for different indications and geographical areas of the world 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in december  the us securities and exchange commission  or the commission  requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition in  we adopted sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements retroactively to january   changing our method of recognizing revenue 
under sab  we recognize revenues from non refundable license fees and milestone payments not specifically tied to a separate earning process ratably over the period during which we have substantial continuing obligations to perform services under the contract 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we estimate the period of deferral based upon our obligations under the contract 
we continually review these estimates and  if any of these estimates change  an adjustment is recorded in the period in which they can become reasonably estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
in the third quarter of  we increased the estimated time period over which we will provide services under the tyco agreement from months to months  resulting in a reduction in revenues of approximately payments received from schering ag for development cost sharing obligations are recorded as revenue when the underlying costs are incurred 
non refundable payments received for which revenue has not been earned are recorded as deferred revenue 
contract advances represent refundable amounts received in advance of services rendered 
royalty revenues are recognized based on actual revenues as reported to us by bracco 
when actual results are not available  we estimate royalty revenues based on bracco s estimates of historical revenues and trends 
we continually review these estimates and record adjustments to the estimates when we receive actual information from bracco 
these adjustments have not been significant to date  but could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
research and development research and development costs  including those associated with technology  licenses and patents  are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs primarily include employee salaries and related costs  third party service costs and consulting expenses 
in order to conduct the clinical trials required for the company s initial product  ms  the company enters into contracts with vendors who render services over an extended period of time  generally one to three years 
typically  the company enters into two types of vendor contracts  time based and patient based 
under a time based contract  using critical factors contained within the contract  typically the stated duration of the contract  and the timing of services provided  the company records the contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which the company estimates the service will be performed 
under a patient based contract  the company first determines an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract  which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract 
the company then records expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled during the period 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews both the timetable of services to be rendered and the timing of services actually received 
based upon this review  revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or to the extent of services performed  or both  in order to reflect the company s most current estimate of the contract 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
employee stock compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
if we accounted for stock options under sfas  we would have recorded additional compensation expense for the stock option grants to employees 
if we are unable to or decide not to continue to account for stock options under apb  our financial results would be materially adversely affected to the extent of the additional compensation expense we would have to recognize  which could change significantly from period to period based on several factors including the number of stock options granted and fluctuations in our stock price and or interest rates

results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
revenues for consisted of million of product development revenue from schering ag  million of royalty and license fee revenue related to the bracco agreement and million of license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco strategic collaboration agreements for the development and marketing of ms the increase in revenue of million primarily related to product development revenue from schering ag 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase in of million was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with research and development personnel and clinical trials related to the advancement of ms through phase iii clinical trials and to increased costs for personnel and other resources to support research and development for our potential discovery phase products 
we are currently performing research and development activities for two projects  ms  which is completing phase iii clinical trials and our thrombus program  which is in the preclinical stage 
ms is an injectable intravascular contrast agent intended to enhance the quality of mr images and provide physicians with a superior method for diagnosing diseases affecting the vasculature 
we have completed enrollment in a phase iii clinical trial program to test the safety and efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease 
we plan to submit our nda related to ms to the fda in the fda review process of an nda submission can vary widely 
if granted expedited review  we could receive product approval within six to eight months from the date of the nda filing date 
however  historically  the fda has required approximately twelve months to review a product nda prior to initial regulatory action with an additional period of at least three to six months required prior to approval 
if approved by the fda  our partner  schering ag  will have primary responsibility for the product launch and marketing of ms both the time frame and costs involved in completing the development of ms  gaining fda approval and commercializing the product may vary greatly for several reasons  including the following we conduct our phase iii clinical trial program in accordance with specific protocols  which we have filed with the fda 
if the fda modifies the protocols we have filed with them or requires us to perform additional studies  we could incur significant additional costs and additional time to complete our phase iii clinical trial program according to the revised plan 
this would also result in a delay in our ability to file an nda with the fda and a delay in the commercialization of our product 
we rely on third party clinical trial centers to find suitable patients for our clinical trial program 
if these third parties do not find suitable patients in the time frame for which we have planned  we will not be able to complete our clinical trial program according to our expected schedule 
such a delay would result in an increase in costs for the development of our ms program  a delay in filing an nda with the fda  and a delay in commercialization of our product 
the length of time that the fda takes to review our nda and the length of time it takes us to respond to fda questions can also vary widely 
any delay in that process would result in an increase in costs and a delay in the commercialization of our product 
our partner  schering ag  is responsible for the launch and marketing of ms if they do not launch the product in a timely manner or market the product effectively  we will incur a delay in receiving revenues after the launch of ms and may not receive enough revenue to enable us to be profitable 
our current plans for completing the development of ms and achieving commercialization reflect our best estimate of the time involved in completing the remaining steps in the development program based on factors currently known to us 
the third parties described above have the ability to greatly impact this timetable  and we may not have control over or be able to respond within our current plan to changes caused by them 
any such delays could result in a significant increase in costs to complete development of ms as well as a delay in product launch  which could enable competition to intensify 
for our second project  the thrombus program  we are seeking to develop a targeted contrast agent that would enable mri to illuminate blood clots 
such a product could potentially change the diagnostic work up for many of the conditions associated with thromboembolic disease  including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis 
we believe that the use of this new approach could lead to better medical outcomes due to earlier and more definitive diagnosis 
we further believe that our proprietary technology platform could enable mri to differentiate old and new clot formation  potentially identifying those clots that pose the most risk to patients and those that are the most treatable 
we have not yet entered into a strategic collaboration with a third party for the development and marketing of our thrombus program 
therefore  we have generated no revenues from this program and have fully funded its costs to date 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our thrombus business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of product candidates may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
consequently  we cannot predict  at this time  the amount of research and development costs that we will incur with regards to our thrombus program 
the duration and cost of bringing a product to market may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during and after clinical trials  including  among others  the following time needed for regulatory approval  number of patients and costs per patient in the clinical trial program  complexity and cost of project management  data collection and data management services provided by outside vendors  and unanticipated adverse safety and efficacy results from the pre clinical or clinical trials 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify disease indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus on more promising product candidates or indications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  benefits  outside professional services and related costs associated with our executive  finance and accounting  business development  marketing  human resources  legal and corporate communications activities  were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in of  was primarily due to increased ms marketing costs and personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses also included royalties payable to mgh based on sales by bracco of multihance 
royalty expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately  was primarily due to realized gains from the sale of marketable securities and higher average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  partly offset by lower interest rates 
net realized gains on marketable securities  which are included in interest income  were  for the year ended december  as compared to none for year the ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase in interest expense in was the result of a full year of interest paid to bracco under the bracco agreement 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes  which represents italian income taxes related to the bracco agreement  was  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the higher foreign income tax expense in of approximately million is directly attributable to the receipt of million from bracco in september upon the execution of the worldwide license agreement with bracco 
any future payments received from bracco are subject to italian income tax withholding 
years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
revenues for consisted of million of product development revenue from schering ag  million of royalty and license fee revenue related to the bracco agreement and million of license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco strategic collaboration agreements for the development and marketing of ms the increase in revenues is a result of million related to the bracco agreement and  in license fee revenue associated with granting schering ag the rights to market ms in japan 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for in the year  a one time charge of million was included in research and development expenses  which related to the reacquisition of the japanese rights to develop and commercialize ms from daiichi  causing an overall decrease in research and development expenses from to excluding this one time charge in  research and development expenses increased million from to primarily due to increased costs for personnel and other resources to support research and development of the company s thrombus imaging program and higher costs associated with advancing ms through clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for general and administrative expenses increased  during as compared to primarily as a result of ongoing corporate activities  royalty expense associated with the bracco agreement and increased personnel and related expenses 
interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the  decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates during compared to offset by higher average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances in as compared to interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in the  decrease was attributable to lower interest rates in the year ended december  along with lower interest expense associated with our decreasing capital lease obligation and the repayment of our note payable 
this decrease was offset by increased interest expense associated with the bracco agreement 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  represents italian income taxes related to the bracco agreement signed in september which we are unable to offset against net operating losses 
there was no provision for income taxes recorded in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities of million at december  on january   we raised million through the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously filed shelf registration statement 
in september  we entered into an agreement with acqua wellington north american equities fund ltd  or acqua wellington  for an equity financing facility 
during  we received  and in  we received  in net proceeds using this facility 
this equity financing facility was terminated in january  in accordance with the terms of the equity financing facility agreement  as a result of our sale of all of the remaining shares available on our then available s shelf registration statement 
acqua wellington did not purchase any shares in the january offering 
we used approximately million of net cash to fund operations for the year ended december  compared to million to fund operations for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used for operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of million 
excluding the million we received from bracco in september  we used million of cash for operations for the year ended december  our investing activities resulted in net cash used of million for the year ended december  and net cash provided of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we purchased million of available for sale marketable securities 
a majority of the funds used for these purchases were derived from the proceeds of the common stock offering completed on january  we also received proceeds of million as a result of investment sales and redemptions 
other investing activities included capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  our capital expenditures consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment  including lab equipment  computer equipment and software 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase in the future as we continue to enhance and expand our principal lab space 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the principal source of financing for the year ended december  was the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously filed shelf registration statement in january  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
partly offsetting some of the cash provided from financing activities was the repayment of the million outstanding loan with tyco in october we currently receive quarterly cash payments from schering ag for their share of development costs of ms  quarterly royalty payments from bracco on their sales of multihance and interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities 
in the future  we may also obtain funding from collaborations for our thrombus program or for other research activities or from a sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec in march  whereby we registered million shares of our common stock 
additional future cash flows depend on the successful filing of an nda  fda approval and product launch of ms  and include up to million in milestone payments from schering ag and our share of the profits earned on sales of ms worldwide 
we may also receive royalties on sales of schering ag s eovist product if it is approved for sale by the fda or international regulatory authorities pursuant to a license agreement with schering ag 
known outflows  in addition to our ongoing research and development and general and administrative expenses  include the semi annual royalties that we owe to mgh on sales by bracco of multihance  and million we owe daiichi in december under the terms of our reacquisition agreement with daiichi 
other potential future outflows depend on the successful filing of an nda  fda approval and product launch of ms  which include million of milestone payments due tyco  a share of profits due tyco on sales of ms worldwide except japan  a royalty to daiichi on sales of ms in japan and a royalty due mgh on our share of the profits of ms worldwide 
we will also be required to repay bracco any unearned prepaid royalties  equaling million at december   upon termination of our license agreement with bracco  plus an additional million if multihance does not receive fda approval in the us in november  bracco announced that it had received an approvable letter from the fda for multihance 
we estimate that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first quarter of we believe that we will need to raise additional funds for research  development and other expenses through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances or otherwise  in order to achieve commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
we anticipate that our development expenses for ms will decrease significantly as a result of our having completed enrollment in our phase iii clinical trial program in the first quarter of in the absence of additional fundraising  in order to fund our operations into the second quarter of  we would need to curtail our research programs  our thrombus program and significantly reduce operating expenses 
we believe that program curtailment and operating expense reductions along these lines can be carried out without impacting our plans for submitting the nda for ms our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both united states and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products  if any  gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our potential products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending to support new research programs as well as the continued development of ms and thrombus we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for any future quarterly or annual period prior to commercialization of ms our ability to reach positive cash flow subsequent to the commercialization of ms will depend on its market acceptance and successful launch by our partner schering ag  as well as the ability of our partner tyco to manufacture sufficient quantities of ms to support schering ag s sales and marketing activities 
we anticipate continued investments in fixed assets  including equipment and facilities expansion to support new and continuing research and development programs 
in the second quarter of  we signed a lease agreement that increased our future lease commitments by million that will enable us to utilize our current principal scientific facilities through december  we also have a lease for nearby office space  which expires in october our major outstanding contractual obligations relate to our facilities leases and our present obligations to strategic partners 
we did not include any commitments for obligations due on our commercial clinical trial programs since most of our commercial contracts contain termination clauses  exercisable by either party  which limit potential future obligations 
below is a table that represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by peiod total beyond operating leases     accrued reacquisition costs   we have incurred tax losses to date and therefore have not paid significant federal or state income taxes since inception 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes resulting from sales of equity securities  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations as defined in sections and of the internal revenue code of  or the code  as amended 
we currently estimate that the annual limitation on our use of net operating losses through may  will be approximately  pursuant to sections and of the code  the change in ownership resulting from public equity offerings in and any other future ownership changes may further limit utilization of losses and credits in any one year 
we also are eligible for research and development tax credits that can be carried forward to offset federal taxable income 
the annual limitation and the timing of attaining profitability may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the uncertainties associated with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  the early stage of our initial product development and lack of product revenues  our history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  our lack of commercial manufacturing experience and commercial sales  distribution and marketing capabilities  reliance on suppliers of key materials necessary for production of our products and technologies  the potential development by competitors of competing products and technologies  our dependence on existing and potential collaborative partners  and the lack of assurance that we will receive any funding under such relationships to develop and maintain strategic alliances  the lack of assurance regarding patent and other protection for our proprietary technology  governmental regulation of our activities  facilities  products and personnel  the dependence on key personnel  uncertainties as to the extent of reimbursement for the costs of our potential products and related treatments by government and private health insurers and other organizations  the potential adverse impact of government directed health care reform  the risk of product liability claims  and economic conditions  both generally and those specifically related to the biotechnology industry 
as a result  our future development efforts involve a high degree of risk 
for further information  refer to the more specific risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to united states government issues  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of our total portfolio of approximately  and an increase of approximately  respectively  at december  the interest rate of our agreement with bracco spa is adjustable on a quarterly basis and therefore subjects the company to interest rate risk 
however  based on the outstanding balance of  a portion of total deferred revenue  and an interest rate of prime plus at december   a increase in the prime rate would increase the company s annual interest expense by approximately
