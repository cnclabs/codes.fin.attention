operations the company s revenues are derived from company owned offices direct sales and independently managed franchise offices licensed sales and franchise royalties 
the company s franchise arrangements are structured in either a traditional franchise format or a licensed franchise format 
under the company s traditional franchise agreements  the traditional franchisee pays all lease and working capital costs relating to its office  including funding payroll and collecting clients accounts 
generally  the franchisee pays the company an initial franchise fee and continuing franchise fees  or royalties  equal to approximately of its gross billings 
royalty fees are reduced when the franchise serves a national client as these clients typically have lower margins and for franchises that have renewed their franchise agreement and qualify for a discounted rate ranging from based on gross billings 
the company processes payroll and invoices clients  and the franchisee employs all management staff and temporary personnel affiliated with its office 
under the company s licensed franchise agreements  the licensee pays the company an initial franchise fee and pays all lease and operating costs relating to its office 
the licensee employs all management staff affiliated with its office  but the company employs all temporary personnel affiliated with the licensed franchise office  handles invoicing and collecting clients accounts  and generally remits to the licensed franchisee of the office s gross profit 
however  the company s share of the licensee s gross profit  representing the continuing franchise fees  is generally not less than of the licensed franchisee s gross billings  with the exception of national accounts on which the company s fee is reduced to compensate for lower gross margins and licensees that have renewed their franchise agreement and qualify for a discounted rate ranging from based on gross revenues 
the percentage of gross profit paid to the licensee is generally based on the level of hours billed during the contract year 
as of september   there were independently managed franchise offices operating as traditional franchises and operating as licensed franchise offices 
in general  franchise offices opened from to are operated as traditional franchises  and independently managed offices opened since are operated as licensed franchise offices 
the company moved from the traditional to the licensed franchise format to exercise more control over the collection and tracking of the receivables generated by the independently managed offices and to allow the company to grow without being limited by the financial resources of traditional franchisees 
accordingly  the number of traditional franchise offices is not anticipated to increase  except in certain circumstances when a licensed franchise office may convert to the traditional franchise format 
additionally  existing traditional franchisees have the option under their contract to open new franchise offices within their territory 
the number of licensed franchise offices is expected to increase because new independently managed offices will be opened in licensed franchise format and offices currently operated as traditional franchises may  depending upon various factors  convert to the licensed franchise format 
if the number of traditional franchise offices is reduced  royalty revenues will decrease 

table of contents the following table sets forth for the last five fiscal years  the number of company owned  traditional and licensed franchise offices and revenues associated with each 
for traditional franchised offices  company revenues are limited to the royalties revenues earned on gross billings

our goal is to significantly lower this percentage over the next three years from to less than

critical accounting policies the discussions and analyses of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations were based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company s management reviews and evaluates these estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  workers compensation costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  income taxes including the valuation 
table of contents allowance for deferred tax assets  contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and a variety of other assumptions believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those most significantly affected by the judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of remedy s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates revenue from the sale of temporary staffing and permanent placement services by its company owned and licensed franchise operations and from royalties on sales of such services by its traditional franchise operations 
temporary staffing revenues and the related labor costs and payroll taxes are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
permanent placement revenues are recognized when the permanent placement candidate begins full time employment 
sales allowances are established to estimate losses due to placed candidates not remaining employed for the company s permanent placement guarantee period  typically days and have historically been insignificant to the company s overall results of operations 
the company accounts for the revenues and the related direct costs in accordance with emerging issues task force reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company is required to assess whether it acts as a principal in its transactions or as an agent acting on the behalf of others 
where the company is the principal in a transaction and has the risks and rewards of ownership  the transaction is recorded gross in the income statement  and where the company acts merely as an agent  only the net fees earned are recorded in the income statement 
under the company s traditional franchised agreement  the franchisee has the direct contractual relationship with customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  the company does not include the revenues and direct expenses from these transactions in its income statement and only records the royalty fee earned 
alternatively  under the company s licensed franchise agreements the company has the direct contractual relationship with customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
as the company retains the risks and rewards of ownership such as the liability for the cost of temporary personnel and the risk of loss for collection  the revenues and direct expenses of its licensed franchise operations are included in the company s results of operations 
the company remits to each licensed franchisee a portion of the gross margin generated by its office s 
accounts receivable remedy provides an allowance for doubtful accounts on its accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based upon management s analysis of historical write off levels  current economic trends  routine assessment of its customers financial strength and any other known factors impacting collectibility 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
remedy s estimates are influenced by the following considerations the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for or more of its net sales and its continuing credit evaluation of its customers financial conditions 
workers compensation costs the company maintains reserves for its workers compensation obligations using actuarial methods to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of all claims  including those incurred but not reported 
this process includes establishing loss development factors  based on the historical claims experience of the company and the industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of the company s ultimate claims liability 
the calculated ultimate liability is then reduced by cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserve 
management evaluates the reserve  and the underlying assumptions  regularly throughout the year and makes adjustments as needed 
while management believes that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to no longer be amortized but instead be subject to an impairment test at least annually or if events or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its book value 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with the initial impairment test upon adoption  the company obtained valuations of its individual reporting units from an independent third party valuation firm 
the valuation methodologies considered included analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  guidelines for publicly traded company multiples and comparable transactions 
as a result of these impairment tests  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income taxes of million  to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill to its implied fair value 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
other long lived assets effective the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company assesses the fair value and recoverability of its long lived assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  the company makes assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors 
the fair value of the long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of the company s business and the overall economic environment 
when it determines that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  it measures impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
the company recorded million  of asset impairment charges related to capitalized software for fiscal  of which million is included in depreciation expense and million is included in selling and administrative expense see note to consolidated financial statements 
there were no asset impairment charges in fiscal year and income taxes in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management estimates the company s income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
this includes estimating the company s actual current tax expense together with any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
the company is required to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considered all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
the company had been profitable through the first fiscal quarter of  however  continued market softness and significant increases in workers compensation costs resulted in significant losses in the remainder of the fiscal year 
the accounting guidance states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of this guidance  and the company s recent cumulative losses  management concluded that a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets was appropriate 
while the company hopes to be profitable in fiscal and beyond  in view of the recent losses  there is no assurance that there will be sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company determines a lesser allowance is required  it would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
contingencies and litigation there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against the company incident to its operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  the company must record the amount of the estimated liability 
based on current available information  management 
table of contents believes that the ultimate resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  management will continue assessing any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise its estimates
