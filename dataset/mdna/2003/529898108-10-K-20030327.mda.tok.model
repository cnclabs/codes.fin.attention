actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
as part of the audit committee of the board of directors regular review of the financial reporting of the company  senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee of the board of directors 
derivatives the company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of its interest rate risks associated with long term debt  commodity price risks associated with forecasted future natural gas requirements and foreign exchange rate risks associated with transactions denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
as such  the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with a corresponding change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of related tax effects 
the company does not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
while the company intends to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if the company does not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
information about fair values  notional amounts and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements and the section titled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the company does not believe it is exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in its interest rate  natural gas and foreign currency hedges as the counterparts are established financial institutions 
pension plans and nonpension postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense income in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company assumes that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
since the pension plans inception in  the company s pension plan assets have earned an average annual return of 
a change of 
in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will change pension expense income by approximately million based on year end data 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes gains and losses in the fair value of plan assets compared to expected returns over the next five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over five years 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the plan assets have earned an actual rate of return of less than in the last two years 
pension expense income in is expected to be million excluding expenses for royal leerdam which was acquired in december compared to million in and million in this is a result of the lower return on plan assets  additional benefits granted to unionized employees during labor negotiations in and a change in the discount rate discussed below 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the current year 
in estimating this rate  the company reviews rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments as a benchmark 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the discount rate used in was 
the effect of each 
change in the discount rate would effect pension expense by approximately million 
the company has not made contributions to the pension plans since their inception in and the company does not anticipate making cash contributions in however  if weak investment returns related to depressed global stock markets and historically low discount rates persist  cash contributions may be required after it is difficult to estimate potential cash contributions  as such amounts are a function of actual investment returns  withdrawals from the plans  changes in interest rates and other factors uncertain at this time 
however  the company believes it is likely that any cash contribution in would not be material 
at december   the fair value of the company s pension assets was million down from million at the end of the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits covering substantially all salaried and hourly employees which are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
employees are generally eligible for benefits upon retirement and completion of a specified number of years of creditable service 
benefits for most hourly retirees are determined by collective bargaining 
under a cross indemnity agreement  owens illinois  inc assumed liability for the nonpension postretirement benefits of company retirees who had retired as of june  the company uses various actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for its retiree health plan 
in estimating the discount rate  the company reviews rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments as a benchmark 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the discount rate used in was 
the effect of a 
change in the discount rate would have no material change to health care expense 
assumed health care cost inflation is based on an initial rate of decreasing to an ultimate rate of over five years 
a percent change in these rates would have changed the nonpension postretirement expense by million 
in  the company recorded expense income for nonpension postretirement benefit costs of million  as compared to million in the company expects to record an expense of million excluding expenses for royal leerdam which was acquired in december in for nonpension postretirement benefit costs

the majority of amounts paid to customers typically occur in the third quarter 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of the company s revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  euro or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of the company s products or that of vitrocrisa compared to foreign competition  the effect of high inflation in mexico and exchange rate changes to the value of the mexican peso and impact of those changes on the earnings and cash flow of vitrocrisa  expressed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates in the us and has entered into interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage its exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert this portion of the company s borrowings from variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
the average fixed rate of interest for the company s borrowings related to the rate agreements at december  is and the total interest rate  including applicable fees  is 
the average maturity of these rate agreements is years at december  total remaining debt not covered by the rate agreements has fluctuating interest rates with a weighted average rate of at december  the company had million of debt subject to fluctuating interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
if the counterparts to these rate agreements fail to perform  the company would no longer be protected from interest rate fluctuations by these rate agreements 
however  the company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparts 
the fair value of the company s rate agreements is determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted expected future variable cash receipts and the discounted future fixed cash payments 
the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate forward curves 
the company does not expect to cancel these agreements and expects them to expire as originally contracted 
the fair market value for the company s rate agreements at december   was million 
in addition to the rate agreements  the company has other derivatives as discussed below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has designated these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
as such  the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged transaction or item affects earnings 
at december   approximately million of unrealized net loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
