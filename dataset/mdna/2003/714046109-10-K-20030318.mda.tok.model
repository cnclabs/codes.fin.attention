item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis contains forward looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
actual results may differ materially from the plans  intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward looking statements we make 
we have included important factors below under the heading forward looking information and factors affecting future performance that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
overview we are a leading provider of scientific instruments  consumables and services to the pharmaceutical  biomedical  environmental testing and general industrial markets 
we design  manufacture  market and service products and systems within three business units life and analytical sciences 
we are a leading provider of drug discovery  genetic screening  environmental and chemical analysis tools and instrumentation 
our life and analytical sciences business unit comprises our life sciences reporting segment and our analytical instruments reporting segment 
optoelectronics 
we provide a broad range of digital imaging  sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical  consumer products and other specialty end markets 
our optoelectronics business unit constitutes a single reporting segment 
fluid sciences 
we provide critical fluid control and containment solutions for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication facilities 
our fluid sciences business unit constitutes a single reporting segment 
formation of our life and analytical sciences business during the fourth quarter of  we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments business units into a new integrated business named life and analytical sciences 
we combined our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses to improve our operational scale  which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales  service and research and development organizations 
our life and analytical sciences business unit comprised two reporting segments for the years presented in this annual report on form k 
in connection with the formation of our life and analytical sciences business unit and expected near term pressure on capital expenditures within certain key end markets  we recorded a million restructuring charge as a result of workforce reductions  facility closures and contract terminations that we expect to make 
we expect many of these actions to occur during the combination of these businesses will require changes to our organizational structure  processes and systems over the next year 
we are targeting annualized pre tax cost savings from the combination of between million and million beginning in  with interim pre tax cost savings of between million and million in we cannot assure you that we will achieve any of these cost savings 

table of contents refinancing transactions in december  we completed a series of related debt refinancing transactions for the purpose of extending our existing average debt maturities 
these transactions included establishing a new senior secured credit facility comprising a million six year term loan and a million five year revolving credit facility  the sale of million principal amount of ten year senior subordinated notes at a price of  the repurchase of million in aggregate accreted amount of our zero coupon debentures due august  the repurchase of million of our notes due october  the repayment of million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march and the termination of both that facility and our unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in march  and the payment of million in satisfaction of all of our obligations under our fremont  california operating lease 
following these transactions  at december   we had million in aggregate accreted amount of outstanding zero coupon debentures and million in outstanding notes 
at december   we had a total of million of the proceeds from the sale of our notes and our new term loan held in escrow to retire substantially all of the remaining zero coupon debentures 
we may redeem some or all of the zero coupon debentures at any time on or after august  at a redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued original issue discount through the redemption date 
under the terms of our new senior credit facility  we are required to redeem in the third quarter of all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at that time 
prior to august   we may from time to time repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
accordingly  the zero coupon debentures are shown as current liabilities on our december  balance sheet 
on march   we redeemed all million outstanding of our notes due march for aggregate consideration of million  resulting in a million loss on the extinguishment 
the indenture governing the notes established the redemption rate we paid in this transaction 
we assumed the notes as part of our november acquisition of packard bioscience company 
acquisitions and divestitures significant acquisitions in november  we completed our acquisition of packard bioscience company for a purchase price of approximately million  primarily in the form of approximately million shares of our common stock and our assumption of approximately million in debt which we subsequently redeemed in march the acquisition extended our capabilities in automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthened our position as a global provider of comprehensive drug discovery tools and solutions 
packard generated sales of approximately million for its fiscal year ended december  in july  we completed our acquisition of nen life sciences  inc  a provider of state of the art drug discovery products  services  reagents and technologies to the life sciences industry  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash and issued warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we repaid approximately million of outstanding indebtedness of nen 
we financed the 
table of contents acquisition and repayment of the outstanding indebtedness with million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 
we repaid these short term borrowings in august with proceeds from the issuance of our zero coupon convertible debentures 
significant divestitures and discontinued operations during october  our board of directors approved a plan to sell our fluid sciences business unit  at which time the business was reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
as of the third quarter of  we had not completed the sale of the business due to external market conditions 
as apb no 
affords one year for the completion of a disposition  we have reflected the fluid sciences business unit within our consolidated results from continuing operations for and adjusted all other periods reported in this annual report on form k to reflect this change 
in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications component business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities 
both businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  which we adopted as of the beginning of in june  our board of directors approved a plan to sell our security and detection systems business 
in june  we completed the sale of our security and detection systems business to l communications 
we received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately million 
these proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment  which we do not expect to be material 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the business and the associated effect of the disposition as a discontinued operation in accordance with apb no 
consolidated results of continuing operations sales compared to sales for were  million versus  million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in year over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from divested businesses and declines in sales within key end markets  offset by the inclusion of packard s results for a full year and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
sales in included million from businesses we have divested 
sales for would have been approximately million higher had packard been included for the first months of the year 
changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales in by approximately million 
key end markets contributing to the year over year decline in sales included pharmaceutical research and development markets within our life sciences reporting segment  several general analytical markets served by our analytical instruments reporting segment  the fiber optic test and ultra specialty lighting markets within our optoelectronics reporting segment and the aerospace and semiconductor assembly markets within our fluid sciences reporting segment 
these declines were partially offset by increased sales within the genetic screening and digital imaging markets and increased sales of consumables and related services 
compared to sales for were  million versus  million during  a decrease of million or less than 
the decrease in year over year sales was due primarily to lost sales from divested businesses and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  offset to some extent by the inclusion of nen s results for a full year and packard s results for two months  as well as increased sales within our genetic screening and drug discovery tools businesses 
our divestiture of businesses in and resulted in a million decline in sales during  while foreign exchange rate changes reduced sales by approximately million 
sales included packard s results for two months  which totaled million 
sales would have been approximately million higher had nen been included for the first seven months of the year 

table of contents cost of sales compared to cost of sales for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of sales  cost of sales increased to in from in the increase in cost of sales was due primarily to unabsorbed manufacturing expenses  unfavorable product mix from the sale of lower margin instruments and increases in material and labor costs 
the unabsorbed manufacturing expenses resulted from decreased production and lower capacity utilization as a result of lower sales and lower inventory 
the increase in cost of sales was offset by benefits from the reduction and relocation of facilities and headcount reductions 
included in cost of sales was a million write off of inventory associated with the optoelectronics reporting segment and million related to the amortization of the write up associated with packard inventory included as part of purchase accounting

the results from included charges of million in similar integration charges mainly attributable to nen 
restructuring charges  net compared to restructuring charges  net for were million versus million during our restructuring charges in included a million charge taken in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses into a single business life and analytical sciences 
this charge consisted of approximately million in severance payments  million in lease cancellation payments and million of asset writedowns 
in addition  during  we took million in net charges associated with workforce reductions and manufacturing facility closures stemming primarily from relocating to lower cost geographies and reduction of our fixed costs 
our net restructuring charges in of million related primarily to employee separation costs associated with the consolidation of european general and managerial functions within both our life sciences and analytical instruments reporting segments

the gain on dispositions in included approximately million on the sale of buildings  approximately million on the disposition of our berthold business  million from other dispositions  primarily within the optoelectronics reporting segment  and million previously deferred from prior dispositions recognized as a result of the resolution of outstanding contingent liabilities 
amortization of intangible assets compared to amortization of intangible assets for was million versus million for  a decrease of million or 
of the amortization expense  million related to the amortization of goodwill in we discontinued the amortization of goodwill with our adoption of sfas no 
at the beginning of the year over year increase in intangible asset amortization was the result of the amortization on intangible assets other than goodwill that arose from the acquisition of packard 
compared to amortization of intangible assets for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
within these amounts  the amortization of goodwill accounted for million in and million in the increase reflects a full year of amortization from the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of nen completed in july and to a lesser extent  the amortization of intangible assets in recorded as part of our acquisition of packard 
other expense  net compared to other expense  net for was million versus million for  an increase of million or 
the increase in other expense  net was due primarily to million in premiums  fees and write offs of unamortized costs resulting from the early extinguishment of debt during  million in transaction costs incurred as part of the proposed sale of the fluid sciences business  a million loss on an equity investment versus net gains of million in  and other items totaling million 
offsetting these amounts were million in gains realized on the repurchase of a portion of the zero coupon convertible debentures  a year over year decline in net interest expense of million and a million gain realized on the termination of a fixed to variable interest rate swap as a result of the tender offer for our notes 
the million in charges associated with the early extinguishment of debt were comprised of a million call premium paid on the extinguishment of the packard debt called in the first quarter of and million in fees and previously capitalized issuance costs written off in connection with our december debt refinancing transactions 
a decline in interest expense to million in from million in was the result of decreased levels of indebtedness and lower associated interest rates period over period 
we expect interest expense in to increase due to the debt we raised as part of our debt refinancing transactions 

table of contents compared to other expense  net for was million versus million in  a decrease of million or 
other expense  net for included gains realized on the sale of investments of million 
the results from included similar gains of million 
interest expense for of million versus million in was the result of higher debt levels due to acquisition activity  offset by lower borrowing costs 
the remaining impact in each of the years was attributable to foreign exchange losses 
provision benefit for income taxes compared to the benefit for income taxes for was million versus a provision of million during our effective tax rate of is primarily attributable to the geographic income patterns  reduced profitability  permanent tax differences and use of foreign tax credits in the united states 
our effective tax rate of was increased by the tax treatment of in process research and development charges associated with our packard acquisition  which were not deductible for tax purposes 
absent these items  we would expect our effective tax rate to approximate

our effective tax rate of was impacted to a lesser extent by similar in process research and development charges 
discontinued operations in june  we sold our security and detection systems business to l communications 
we received cash proceeds in this transaction of approximately million at closing 
the proceeds are subject to a working capital adjustment  which we do not expect to be material 
we have reflected the business and the associated impact of the disposition as a discontinued operation within our consolidated financial statements in accordance with apb no 
for the portion of prior to being sold  our security and detection systems business had sales of million 
also in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our telecommunications component business and a plan to sell our entertainment lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities 
we have reflected both businesses as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
as of june   we had shut down our telecommunications component business 
for  our telecommunications component business had sales of million and our entertainment lighting business had sales of million 
effect of accounting change we adopted sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment of testing provisions of sfas no 
 which resulted in a million after tax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within the optoelectronics business unit 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we have taken this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal contingencies we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of december   representing management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential 
table of contents remedies  possible joint and several liability  the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from the amounts recorded 
we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged various statements made by us were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the lawsuits and we intend to contest the actions vigorously 
we are currently unable  however  to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters 
reporting segment results of continuing operations we report our continuing operations as four reporting segments  reflecting our management methodology and structure 
our security and detection systems business  previously reported as part of our analytical instruments reporting segment  and our telecommunications component business and entertainment lighting business  previously reported as part of our optoelectronics reporting segment  have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies of our reporting segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate performance based on profitability of the respective reporting segments 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by reporting segment for versus and for versus life sciences compared to sales for were million versus million in  an increase of million or 
year over year sales increased due primarily to the timing of the packard acquisition  increased sales in our genetic screening business and increased sales in consumables and services 
these increases were offset in part by a decline in sales from drug discovery instruments due to challenges within the pharmaceutical research and development end markets 
sales in would have been approximately million higher had the results from packard been included for the first ten months of the year 
operating profit for was million versus a loss of million in the year over year increase in operating profit was primarily attributable to the inclusion of million in charges in versus million in charges during principally associated with acquisitions and restructurings 
the operating profit for included million in net restructuring charges  including a million charge taken in the fourth quarter of for severance and facility closure actions stemming from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses into a single business life and analytical sciences

sales of higher margin products and the benefit of lower costs resulting from the consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites reduced the operating loss in goodwill and intangible asset amortization expenses were million for and million for analytical instruments compared to sales for were million versus million for  a decrease of million or 
the year over year decrease was due primarily to business divestitures and declines in sales due to weakness in the general analytical and pharmaceutical end markets 
these declines were offset by favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and by increased sales of consumables and services

goodwill and intangible asset amortization was million in and million in liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures and service our debt and other long term liabilities 
our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets  particularly the debt markets 
in the near term  we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest payments on our debt 
in the long term  we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long term liabilities 
principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include deterioration of sales due to weakness in several markets in which we sell our products and services  changes in our working capital requirements  and our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations 
principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include financial covenants contained in our new borrowings  a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market  and volatility in the markets for corporate debt 
cash flows fiscal year operating activities 
net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was million in contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during was a decrease in working capital  which includes accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  of million 
the working capital decrease during reflects improved working capital management as well as a million inventory adjustment within our optoelectronics reporting segment  offset by a net decrease of million in proceeds from our receivable securitization program

our debt levels increased by million to million at december  included in this amount is million of our outstanding indebtedness under the zero coupon convertible debentures which were not tendered as part of our refinancing transactions for which we had million of cash held in escrow at december  for the purpose of retiring 
after consideration of the cash held in escrow  our debt decreased by million 
because we anticipate that the cash held in escrow will be used to repurchase outstanding zero coupon debentures in  we believe that an understanding of our debt levels after consideration of the escrow provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition 
reductions in debt included million of notes and million of zero coupon convertible debentures  both of which we repurchased as part of our debt refinancing transactions 
debt reductions in also included million of senior subordinated ten year notes issued by packard in march  which we repurchased at a rate of  and million in other credit facilities we paid down during offsetting these reductions was our december issuance of senior subordinated notes which generated proceeds of million and our establishment of a term loan which generated proceeds of million

this was partially offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable which was net of million from the receivable securitization program discussed below 
also impacting cash provided by operating activities during was a million reduction in accrued expenses  restructuring and other assets and liabilities 
offsetting these amounts was million from the tax benefit from the exercise of common stock options

table of contents financing activities 
in  we used million of net cash from financing activities 
cash flows generated through operating and investing activities  along with net proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options  were used in part to reduce short term commercial paper borrowings by million during cash utilized in the payment of dividends to common stockholders totaled million during borrowing arrangements senior secured credit facility 
in december  we entered into a new senior credit facility 
this facility comprises a six year term loan in the amount of million and a million five year revolving credit facility 
this credit facility is secured primarily by a substantial portion of our and our subsidiaries domestic assets 
the interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
the base rate is the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable margin for the term loan is basis points for the eurodollar rate and basis points for the base rate 
the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility is determined based upon our leverage ratio for the prior quarter 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
at december   the eurodollar rate was approximately basis points and the base rate was basis points 
the term loan is repayable in nominal quarterly installments until december  and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments until december the revolving credit facility is available to us through december for our working capital needs 
at december   we had no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum senior leverage ratio  and a maximum total leverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
notes 
in december  we issued and sold ten year senior subordinated notes at a rate of with a face value of million 
we received million in gross proceeds from the issuance 
deferred issuance costs of million were recorded as a non current asset 
the debt  which matures in january  is unsecured  but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries 
interest on our notes is payable semi annually on january and july  beginning july  if a change of control occurs  each holder of notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
before january   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of our notes with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  if at least of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption 
we may redeem some or all of our notes at any time on or after january   at a redemption price of 
the redemption price decreases to on january   to on january  and to on january  the debt is subordinated to our new senior credit facility and other existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 
our notes contain financial and other covenants 
most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by standard poor s rating services and moody s investors service 
at december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
zero coupon convertible debentures 
in august  we sold zero coupon convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price of million 
we used the offering s net proceeds of approximately million to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings  which had been increased temporarily 
table of contents to finance the nen acquisition 
the zero coupon convertible debentures are due august and were priced with a yield to maturity of 
during  we repurchased million of our zero coupon convertible debentures in open market transactions  recognizing a gain of million in the process 
as part of our debt refinancing transactions  we commenced an offer to purchase any and all of our existing zero coupon convertible debentures 
as of december   we had completed the tender offer and repurchased million in aggregate accreted amount of the issue 
the remaining million in aggregate accreted amount at december  will either be repurchased prior to the first available call date of august   through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  or called by us thereafter 
under the terms of our new senior credit facility  we are required to redeem all of the zero coupon debentures remaining outstanding on august  accordingly  our zero coupon debentures are shown as current liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
in december  we deposited million in escrow to retire substantially all our outstanding zero coupon debentures 
assuming all of the zero coupon debentures outstanding at december  remain outstanding at august   our redemption of those zero coupon debentures would require million on that date 
we expect to use available cash to satisfy our obligations on the zero coupon debentures in excess of the escrow amount 
through march   we have repurchased million of accreted value of our outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of the funds held in escrow 
notes 
in october  we issued million in notes bearing an interest rate of and maturing in interest on the notes is payable semi annually on april and october during the fourth quarter of  the fixed rate on these notes was swapped to a floating rate using a swap instrument which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month usd libor 
as part of our debt refinancing transactions  we initiated a tender offer for all of the outstanding notes 
as of december   we had completed the tender offer and repurchased all but million of these notes 
we paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer 
the consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our notes 
we may from time to time repurchase outstanding notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in connection with this tender offer  we extinguished the swap arrangement and recorded a million gain on the extinguishment 
packard notes 
in november  we completed our acquisition of packard and assumed approximately million of senior subordinated ten year notes issued in march we redeemed the notes on march  at a rate of in accordance with the indenture dated as of march  as such  this amount was reclassified to short term on our december  balance sheet for presentation purposes 
in connection with this redemption  we realized a loss of million as a result of the call premium paid to the holders of the notes 
receivables securitization facility in december  we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase  on a revolving basis  certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution 
as collections reduce the accounts receivable balances  new receivables are sold 
our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables 
under the terms of this arrangement  we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances 
the accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to million in accounts receivable funding 
the facility has an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus basis points as of december  amounts funded by the counterparty under this facility were million at december  and million at december  the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above  as defined by standard poor s rating services  and ba or above  as defined by moody s investors service 
at december   we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bb with a stable outlook from standard poor s rating services  and of ba with a stable outlook from moody s investors service 
in january  we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our accounts receivable securitization facility to january  
table of contents dividends our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of cents per share 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular cash dividend 
stock split at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from  shares to  shares

under the terms of our new senior credit facility  we are required to redeem in the third quarter of any remaining zero coupon debentures outstanding at that time 
at december   the outstanding zero coupon debentures had an aggregate accreted amount of million 
at the time we redeem or otherwise repurchase the outstanding zero coupon debentures  the escrow amount may be less than the aggregate accreted amount of the zero coupon debentures 
we expect to use available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon debentures with a redemption price exceeding the escrow amount 
the accreted value at august  of the remaining zero coupon debentures outstanding at december  would be million 
however  through march   we have repurchased million of accreted value of our outstanding zero coupon debentures in open market transactions using a portion of our funds held in escrow 
during  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million primarily for the introduction of new products  the improvement of operating processes and the shift of production capacity to lower cost geographies 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 

table of contents change in accounting principle and new accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized  but instead are subject to periodic impairment testing which  at a minimum  will occur on an annual basis 
we adopted sfas no 
as of the beginning of fiscal and have accordingly ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of sfas no 
 which resulted in a million after tax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business unit 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal as part of our ongoing compliance with the sfas no 
 we will perform our annual assessment during the first quarter 
our consolidated financial statements also reflect our early adoption of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of july  accordingly  we reflected the gains and losses resulting from our retirement of debt during in other expense  net within our consolidated income statements rather than as extraordinary items 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies eitf issue no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated by us after december  sfas no 
does not affect the restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
have been implemented in note and note to the accompanying financial statements  and the interim reporting requirements will be adopted in the first interim period in we have not determined whether we will undertake a change to the fair value method in the near future 
as our supplemental disclosure in note and note indicates  our adoption of the fair value provisions of sfas no 
would have a negative effect on our consolidated income statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating but have not yet determined the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we analyze our installation requirements and record revenue only when installation is perfunctory  in instances where installation is necessary to ensure the functionality of the product  we do not recognize revenue until the product is installed 
a provision is made at the time sales are recognized for the cost of any perfunctory installation obligations and the estimated cost of product warranties 
we estimate product warranty obligations based on labor and material costs we incur within the one year warranty period 
future changes in warranty costs could decrease or increase our earnings 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
as discussed  in change in accounting principle and new accounting pronouncements above  we will be required in the third quarter of  to implement eitf this standard may impact our revenue recognition methodology as described above 
we are currently assessing this impact 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings and our cash flows 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture inventory 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that the inventory continues to maintain a market value that is in excess of its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  where necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirement or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings and cash flows 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values  and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and intangible assets and on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
as reported in our financial statements  the initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under sfas no 
resulted in a million charge to our earnings 
the charge relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our optoelectronics business segment was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end markets 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items 
table of contents such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits 
we develop estimates of the cost of the health care  pension and post retirement benefits we provide to employees based on factors including current discount rates  trends in health care costs  projected returns on trust assets and anticipated salary increases 
the impact of pension and post retirement benefits have not had a material impact on the results from operations or cash flows 
our anticipated rate of return for our pension plans has been based  in general  on the average rate of return on assets expected 
the expected rate of return on assets is based both on our actual long term historic return on assets and expected future rates of return for the asset investment classes 
the discount rates used to measure our pension obligation reflect rates at which the pension benefit could be settled 
the discount rates chosen are based on the current returns of investment quality bonds 
in light of declining interest rates and rates of asset returns  we reduced our discount rate and expect to reduce our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the reduction in rates is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results 
changes in these assumptions could lead to changes in estimates of cost and  consequently  to additional charges or credits to our earnings 
we have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees because of the defined dollar plan feature we adopted 
our future liability therefore  cannot be impacted by future changes in the cost of health care 
restructuring activities 
our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs and estimates of sub rental income and  as discussed earlier  asset impairments 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
when such changes in estimates occur they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
at the time we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and our tax structure is complex 
tax rates in countries throughout the world vary substantially and are  on occasion  subject to fluctuations given the current political and economic climate in those countries 
we employ tax planning strategies so as to minimize our overall tax burden 
these strategies contemplate tax rates being in effect in certain countries and we use these rates to determine both our current and deferred tax status 
any significant fluctuations in rates and tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of december  
table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly 
for the year ended december   net losses from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to sales and expense totaled  the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately million at december  and million as of december  at december   the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges was insignificant 
at december   the approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges was market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures can take a variety of different forms as our international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results 
reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while such exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings  such impacts are purely a result of the translation effect and do not impact our short term cash flows in any material way 
in all parts of the world  our subsidiaries do  on occasion  invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
our manufacturing and distribution organization is world wide 
accordingly  inventories are manufactured in one location  stored in another  and distributed in a third location 
this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in these currencies 
the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time 
accordingly  there may be times when a subsidiary is on the receiving side or the lending side of a short term advance from either the parent company or another affiliate 
such advances  again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity s functional currency  can expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 
in order to repay debt or take advantage of tax saving opportunities  we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the us 
when this occurs  we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into dollars 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by such transactions 

table of contents we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of the hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize such exposures through our hedging program 
our var computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of december   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this var measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during the four quarters ended december   the var ranged between million and million  and averaged approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described earlier  our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows as they relate to interest and our earnings 
for the year ended december   we maintained  for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio  an interest rate swap that served to effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
this interest rate swap was specifically designed to serve as both a fair value hedge on our million debt and to modify our cash flows so that our net interest payments would be reduced in the event that interest rates continued to decline 
the swap was marked to market in our consolidated financial statements so that fair value movements in the swap were offset by the fair value movement in the debt 
this swap position was terminated at the end of when the debt was effectively retired 
interest rate risk sensitivity as we have discussed above  we have restructured our debt in the fourth quarter of accordingly  as of december   of our debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and represented by variable rate debt 
there are currently no interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments outstanding intended to hedge fair value  cash flow or earnings exposures 
our current debt covenants also require that we maintain at least of our debt portfolio in fixed rate debt as defined in the credit agreement 
our current earnings exposure can be summarized as follows changes in interest rates can cause our interest charges on million in variable rate debt to fluctuate 
a increase or approximately basis points in current interest rates would cause additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
just as described immediately above  an increase of or approximately basis points in current interest rates can cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change 
however  such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market 

table of contents forward looking information and factors affecting future performance this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements as defined in section e of the securities exchange act of for this purpose  any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward looking statements including  among others  the factors set forth below 
the following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations our operating results may continue to be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell our products 
some of the industries and markets into which we sell our products are cyclical 
industry downturns often are characterized by reduced product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling prices and profits 
significant downturns in our customers markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand for several of our products and have hurt our operating results 
for example  during  our operating results were adversely affected by downturns in many of the markets we serve  including the pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductor and aerospace markets 
current economic conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of our customers  which in turn has adversely affected our sales and business 
these trends are continuing in if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our sales and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
therefore  we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing new products  we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invests heavily in research  and development of products that do not lead to significant sales 
in addition  some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions  which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications 
for example  some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research  and exclude clinical diagnostics applications 
our substantial debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities 
we have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness including million in outstanding zero coupon 
table of contents debentures  excluding obligations under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
also  we have million in borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility 
our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to pay the principal or interest in respect of our indebtedness 
we may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industries in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources 
a significant portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates 
as a result  our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase 
our ability to satisfy our obligations  and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy 
if we are unable to service our debt and fund our business  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional financing or equity capital  restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our notes may limit our activities 
our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our notes contain  and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain  restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make investments  create liens  sell assets  in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us  in the case of our restricted subsidiaries  guarantee or secure indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create unrestricted subsidiaries  and 
table of contents consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
we are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors  including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates  changes in technology and changes in the level of competition 
our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument  which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date 
also  an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our notes  and a default under our notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt 
if an event of default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under our indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility  those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement 
our inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility 
economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales 
because we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our sales originating outside the united states represented of our total sales in the fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation  and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations  and we can offer no assurance of our ability to make such adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  
table of contents research and development and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter 
factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as pharmaceutical  biomedical  semiconductors and aerospace  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  our competitors announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
we may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies  integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable 
we have in the past  and may in the future  supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines  such as our acquisition of packard bioscience company in november we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons  including competition among buyers and licensees  the need for regulatory and other approvals  our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions  the high valuations of businesses and technologies  and restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness  including the indenture governing the notes and our new senior credit facility 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable 
accordingly  the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  either through public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us 
if we do not successfully integrate our life sciences and analytical instruments business units  we may not achieve the benefits we anticipate we will derive from the combination of these businesses 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments business units into a new integrated business named life and analytical sciences  representing of our total sales for this combination is subject to various integration risks  and the integration of these two business units may not achieve the benefits we anticipate it will achieve 
as a result of the combination  we may experience a loss of productivity  sales and key personnel 
in addition  the information technology systems of the two businesses may not be fully compatible 
if any of these potential difficulties were to occur and persist  the business results of our life sciences and analytical instruments reporting segments could suffer 

table of contents we are targeting annualized cost savings from the combination of our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses of between million and million 
because we anticipate that the benefits of the combination of these businesses will not be fully realized until  we are targeting cost savings of between million and million in while we believe these cost savings to be reasonable  they are estimates that are inherently difficult to predict and are necessarily speculative in nature 
in addition  unforeseen factors may offset some or all of the estimated cost savings or other benefits from the integration 
as a result  our actual cost savings  if any  could differ or be delayed  compared to our estimates 
our loss of licenses may require us to stop selling products or lose competitive advantage 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology  we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products  redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage 
potential competitors could in license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share 
our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations 
if we fail to comply with these obligations we could lose important rights under a license  such as the right to exclusivity in a market 
in some cases  we could lose all rights under the license 
in addition  rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control 
for example  the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons  including invalidity of the licensed patent  or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products 
we anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors  technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
some of the products produced by our life and analytical sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar international agencies 
in addition  some of the activities of our fluid sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the united states federal aviation administration 
these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities  from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales  resales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies  we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution 
in addition  we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products 
obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products  processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive  we may infringe intellectual property rights of third parties 
patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time consuming and expensive 
we own many united states and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to cover our products 
we may not obtain issued patents from any pending or 
table of contents future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology 
third parties may seek to challenge  invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition to our patents  we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties 
the measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights may not be adequate 
moreover  in some cases  the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing  using  importing or selling our products in the united states or abroad 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets 
as of december   our total assets included billion of net intangible assets 
net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights  trademark rights and technology licenses  net of accumulated amortization 
these assets have historically been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal instead  we will test these items  at a minimum  on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned 
during the second quarter of  we completed our transitional implementation of the impairment testing provisions of sfas no 
 which resulted in a million before and after tax charge for goodwill associated with our lighting business 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we took this charge as the effect of an accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal future impairment testing may result in additional intangible asset write offs  which could adversely affect our results of operations
