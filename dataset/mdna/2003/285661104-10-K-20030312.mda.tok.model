for million in cash 
in addition  we entered an agreement to license its web hosting automation software opsware for a fee of million over three years 
on july   we acquired the airline infrastructure outsourcing business and internal it infrastructure assets of sabre holdings corporation for million in cash 
sabre s airline infrastructure outsourcing business included contracts with american airlines  us airways and other airline and transportation industry clients 
on july   we acquired a controlling interest in systematics ag  a german it services company 
the aggregate purchase price for such interest was million comprised of million in cash and million in eds stock million common shares 
systematics provided customer relationship management  enterprise resource planning  digital value chain and systems integration services 
a remaining minority interest was acquired in for an immaterial amount 
on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of structural dynamics research corporation sdrc for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
sdrc offered software and services in mechanical design  product data management and business integration 
on september   we acquired the publicly held minority interest in our unigraphics solutions inc ugs subsidiary for million in cash 
we combined ugs and sdrc to create the plm solutions line of business to deliver integrated technology and services supporting the entire lifecycle of a product 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts attributed to in process research and development r d in the allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition must be immediately expensed 
in connection with the acquisitions of sdrc and the minority interest in ugs  we recorded a pre tax charge relating to the write off of acquired in process r d totaling million 
at the respective dates of these acquisitions  the in process r d projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use if their development was not successfully completed 
the development projects generally included enhancements and upgrades to existing technology  enhanced communication among systems  introduction of new functionality and the development of new technology primarily for integration purposes 
the sdrc development projects ranged from to complete and the ugs development projects ranged from to complete at their respective acquisition dates 
the value of the in process r d was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated income stream of the related product sales 
the projected net cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital between and for the sdrc projects and between and for the ugs projects based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital for publicly traded companies within the software industry  the stage of completion of each of the projects  costs and complexity of the work completed to date and to be completed  and other risks associated with completing the development 
all projects have been completed as of december  on october   ugs acquired all of the outstanding stock of engineering animation  inc eai for million  net of cash acquired 
eai was a leader in internet enabled visual process management  collaboration  analysis and communication solutions for extended manufacturing enterprises 
costs allocated to in process r d in the amount of million were expensed upon acquisition 
results of operations consolidated revenues 
the following table displays revenues from contracts with our base non gm clients and revenues from contracts with gm for the years ended december   and in millions revenues base gm total the following table displays our revenue growth percentages for  and  as adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and divestitures total base gm growth in as reported revenues impact of foreign currency changes constant currency revenue growth impact of acquisitions impact of divestitures organic revenue growth constant currency revenue growth is calculated by removing from current year reported revenues the impact of the change in exchange rates between the local currency and the us dollar from the current period and the comparable prior period 
organic revenue growth further excludes revenue growth due to acquisitions in the period presented if the comparable prior period had no revenue from the same acquisition  and revenue decreases due to businesses divested in the period presented or the comparable prior period 
total revenues increased million  or  in to billion when compared with billion in total revenues increased in on a constant foreign currency basis 
total organic revenues decreased in after adjustments for foreign currency fluctuations and revenue variances associated with our sabre  systematics and sdrc acquisitions completed in mid and our canadian based hardware reseller unit sold in early revenues from base clients increased million  or  in to billion when compared with billion in on a constant foreign currency basis  revenues from base clients increased in base organic revenues were flat in compared with growth in our operations solutions line of business from contracts signed with base clients during and was offset by declines in discretionary spending by clients in our solutions consulting  plm solutions and at kearney lines of business 
revenues from gm decreased million  or  in to billion when compared with billion in revenues from gm decreased in on a constant currency basis 
the decrease in gm revenues was primarily due to the continued reductions in discretionary spending by that client 
we expect revenues to continue to be negatively impacted by the tight discretionary spending environment we experienced in we expect full year base organic revenues to increase at rates generally forecasted by it industry analysts  which is currently in the low to mid single digit range 
our gm revenues  which we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by reductions in discretionary spend by that client  will also be negatively impacted by price and scope reductions in our renegotiated sector agreements for gm s north american operations and gmac and our renegotiated global mainframe compute agreement 
as a consequence  we expect our full year gm revenues to decline in the percentage range of the mid teens to low twenties

for the years ended december   and  as adjusted for impacts associated with the worldcom and us airways bankruptcies and cessation of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles gross margins as reported worldcom and us airways bankruptcy provisions goodwill and certain intangibles amortization as adjusted our gross margin in was adversely affected by receivable reserves and asset writedowns related to our contractual relationships with worldcom and us airways  both of which filed for bankruptcy in excluding the impact of these charges  our gross margin percentage was in cost of revenues for and includes amortization expense related to goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer amortized under a new accounting standard effective january  excluding amortization expense related to these assets  our gross margin percentages for and were and  respectively 
approximately basis points  or million  of the decrease in our adjusted gross margin percentage in was due to loss accruals related to the financial performance of certain contracts  primarily in europe 
as further described in results of operations segments  our gross margin also decreased due to our inability to transition  in the timeframe originally planned  from the existing it cost structures inherited from certain operations solutions clients  to the final  more efficient planned it operating environment  and due to declines in higher margin discretionary it applications spending by certain solutions consulting clients 
these decreases were partially offset by a basis point improvement resulting from reduced sales commission and employee bonus expense as discussed below 
the increase in our gross margin percentage in was primarily due to our companywide productivity initiatives 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in this percentage in was primarily due to our revenue growth  both organically and through acquisitions  and our productivity initiatives that led to efficiencies in our general and administrative processes

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 we reclassified certain available for sale securities into the trading securities classification resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of million in our statement of income 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rates in  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in was due to acquired in process r d expense in which was not deductible in the computation of the provision for income taxes  and the reduction in nondeductible goodwill amortization expense associated with the new accounting standard for goodwill adopted january  the increase in our effective tax rate in was due to acquired in process r d expense in excluding the impact of nondeductible acquired in process r d and goodwill amortization expense  our effective income tax rates in and were and  respectively

requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
during and  we recognized amortization expense of million and million  respectively  related to assets for which amortization was discontinued effective january  upon adoption of sfas no 
benchmarking 
certain long term it outsourcing agreements  principally in our operations solutions line of business  contain provisions which permit a client to request a benchmark study by a mutually acceptable third party benchmarker 
typically  benchmarking may not be conducted during the initial years of the contract term but may be requested by a client periodically thereafter  subject to restrictions which limit benchmarking to certain groupings of services and limit the number of times benchmarking may be elected during the term of the contract 
generally  the benchmarking compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers to a peer comparison group  subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors 
generally  if the benchmarking shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range  and the difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client  then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing 
this may result in the reduction of our rates for the benchmarked services 
approximately of our it service contracts contain benchmarking provisions  and services representing approximately of annual revenues are eligible for benchmarking in we expect services representing a similar percentage of annual revenues would be eligible for benchmarking in subsequent years 
given the competitive market in which we operate  our client agreements generally provide for pricing during the beginning of the contract term at what we believe are market rates  with contractual rates decreasing over time to levels that are below market rates in effect at the beginning of the contract based on our expectation of achieving operating efficiencies and other cost reductions over the contract term 
because we have been successful historically in achieving these operating efficiencies and other cost reductions  benchmarking provisions have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flow  and we do not expect these provisions to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flow in however  due to the enhanced focus of our clients on reducing it costs  as well as the uncertainties and complexities inherent in benchmarking comparisons  clients may increasingly attempt to obtain additional price reductions beyond those already embedded in our contract rates through the exercise of benchmarking provisions 
there can be no assurance such activities would not negatively impact our results of operations or cash flow in or thereafter to a greater extent than has been our prior experience 
nmci contract 
in october  we were awarded a contract by the us navy and marine corps to provide end to end it infrastructure on a seat management basis 
the nmci contract  as originally executed  had a base period of five years with a three year extension at the option of the navy 
deliverables are rolled out to individual users following the order of a procurement contracting officer 
upon issuance of orders  we and the navy establish a timeline to assume responsibility for the existing infrastructure legacy systems supporting the ordered seats 
upon this assumption of responsibility  we are paid of the established seat price as we establish the new systems and infrastructure needed to support delivery of the enhanced service to the ordered seats 
upon completion of this activity  the seat is switched to the new environment and after we have achieved the agreed upon performance standards we are entitled to bill at of the established seat price 
we developed the pricing for the nmci contract based on the assumption that we would receive revenues and seat orders in the amounts and during the periods projected in the contract s pricing schedule 
for a number of reasons  including the significant increase in the number of legacy systems we have been required to test and certify during the performance of the contract and the imposition by the navy and congress of additional testing requirements beyond the commercial testing requirements anticipated at the time the contract was awarded  the roll out schedule on which we based our pricing has been delayed significantly 
in october  we executed a modification to the nmci contract with the navy 
under that modification  the base period was extended from five to seven years  with a minimum aggregate order obligation of the navy for certain specified deliverables  primarily seat services  of billion over the seven year base period 
in addition  we released the navy from any liability under the contract for certain potential claims  including claims for equitable adjustments or claims attributable to delays in issuing orders for seats up to the date of the modification 
due to the continuing risk associated with the timing and type of seat deployment and the associated pricing  we do not anticipate recognizing profit on the nmci contract in any significant amount in as of december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected approximately billion of assets  consisting of unbilled revenue  property and equipment  and other assets  attributable to the contract 
at december   the navy was authorized to order  computer seats for the current program year ending september  at such date  we had approximately  computer seats under management  of which approximately  were then billable to the client 
approximately  of these computer seats had been switched over to the new environment 
we expect to assume responsibility for virtually all of the  computer seats by the end of march material delays in the transfer of these seats could negatively impact the financial performance of the contract and our earnings during the quarter in which any such delays occur 
under the terms of the nmci contract  as modified  the navy is obligated to order an additional  computer seats upon our meeting service level agreements on an existing  seats and our successful completion of an operational assessment 
as of february   such service level agreements had been met  the operational assessment was successfully completed and the navy was authorized to order the additional  seats 
material delays in the assumption of responsibility for or installation of additional seats under this contract could negatively impact the financial performance of this contract and significantly reduce our earnings and operating cash flow during the quarter in which any such delays occur 
worldcom 
we provide it services to worldcom  the majority of which are provided under an year  billion services agreement signed in october on july   worldcom filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
worldcom represented approximately million of our revenues 
total receivables outstanding under such agreements  net of reserves  were approximately million at december  we own equipment and other assets having a net book value of approximately million deployed on worldcom it services agreements  and approximately one percent of our employee base is dedicated to performing services thereunder 
worldcom may reject its it services contracts in bankruptcy 
however  we expect to reach agreement with worldcom on revised terms for such agreements which reflect both changes in its service requirements and reductions to certain existing rates 
although we believe we would be able to redeploy employees and adjust our cost base to mitigate the earnings impact of a change in service requirements to worldcom  we expect a reduction in rates would negatively impact our revenues and earnings in and thereafter 
in either event  we expect to recover the material asset balances associated with these contracts through future operations 
in addition to our it services agreements with worldcom  we entered into an year network services agreement in requiring us to procure telecommunications network services from worldcom and providing for both cumulative and annual take or pay revenue commitments 
certain terms of the network services agreement were amended as part of a settlement agreement approved by worldcom s bankruptcy court on december  as part of the settlement agreement  the parties acknowledged that we did not owe any penalties for take or pay obligations with respect to network spend  the cumulative take or pay obligations in the original agreement were eliminated and the future annual take or pay obligations were substantially reduced 
we expect to meet the reduced minimum levels of network spend in the normal course of business 
we also agreed to refund over time million of a network payment received from worldcom upon signing the original agreement in such balance was carried on our balance sheet on the date of the settlement 
due to uncertainties regarding the recoverability of pre bankruptcy receivables and certain assets associated with the worldcom it services and network contracts  we recorded net reserves and asset writedowns totaling million during these amounts are reflected in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of income 
in a transaction unrelated to the agreements referred to above  we entered into a fiber optic equipment leveraged lease with mci communications corporation  a domestic subsidiary of worldcom  in our unrecovered investment in the related equipment totaled million at december  the equipment is currently being used by worldcom  and they are making lease payments in accordance with contractual schedules 
however  worldcom may reject its leveraged lease through its bankruptcy proceeding 
us airways 
we provide it services to us airways through a long term agreement 
on august   us airways filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the us airways contract represented approximately million of our revenues 
total receivables outstanding under such agreement  net of reserves  were approximately million at december  we own equipment and other assets having a net book value of approximately million deployed on the us airways services agreement 
although us airways has indicated we will continue to be its it services provider  we are currently in negotiations regarding revisions to its it services contract 
we expect the revised contract would negatively impact the revenue and earnings attributable to that client  although we do expect to recover the material asset balances associated with the contract through future operations 
due to uncertainties regarding the recoverability of pre bankruptcy receivables associated with the us airways contract  we recorded reserves totaling million during this amount is reflected in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of income 
we also recorded a writedown to our investment in a partnership totaling million during due in part to uncertainties related to the recovery of that partnership s investment in leveraged leases with us airways 
other airline industry relationships 
our largest contract in the airline industry is with american airlines 
that contract has annual revenues slightly below million and represented approximately million in receivables and million in operating assets at december  in addition  we have million of exposure associated with american s portion of our aircraft leveraged lease investments 
the remaining exposure to investments in aircraft leases totals approximately million 
we also have approximately million in annual revenues from other us and international airline and related travel businesses  the majority of which is provided by seven clients accounting for approximately million in receivables and million of contract related assets at december  other 
some of our client contracts require significant investment in the early stages which is recovered through billings over the life of the respective contracts 
these contracts often involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies 
substantial performance risk exists in each contract with these characteristics  and service delivery under these contracts is dependent upon successful completion of the development  construction and deployment phases 
we are currently in the development and construction phase of one such commercial contract in which we have invested assets of million  including receivables  prepaid expenses  equipment and software 
this contract has experienced delays in its development and construction phases  and certain milestones in the contract have been missed 
while we believe we can deliver the required systems and services and our investment in this contract will be recovered over the contract s terms  significant further delays in development and construction could result in an impairment of a large portion of the associated assets 
seasonality and inflation 
our revenues  net income and operating cash flow vary over the calendar year  with the fourth quarter generally reflecting the highest revenues  net income and operating cash flow for the year due to certain services that are purchased more heavily in that quarter as a result of the spending patterns of several clients 
in addition  revenues generally increase from quarter to quarter as a result of new business added throughout the year 
inflation generally had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
results of operations segments effective april   we combined elements of our information solutions  business process management and e solutions lines of business into two new lines of business operations solutions and solutions consulting 
the operations solutions line of business integrates the it outsourcing operations  including centralized and distributed systems and communications management  of our former information solutions line of business with the business process outsourcing capabilities of our former business process management line of business 
the solutions consulting line of business combines the capabilities of e solutions with the applications services business of our former information solutions line of business 
at kearney and plm solutions remain separate lines of business 
revenues and operating income of non us operations are measured using fixed currency exchange rates in all periods presented 
differences between fixed and actual exchange rates are included in the all other category 
the all other category also includes at kearney and corporate expenses 
certain historical information is not readily available under the new reporting structure 
as such  revenues and operating income expense for have been estimated based on the information reported under the previous organizational structure

revenues from base clients increased million  or  in to billion 
base organic revenues increased approximately million in after excluding approximately million in revenues recognized in related to our sabre and systematics acquisitions in mid  and approximately million in revenues recognized in related to the divestiture of our canadian based hardware reseller unit

revenues from base clients increased million in to billion 
base organic revenues decreased approximately million in after excluding approximately million in revenues recognized in related to our sabre and systematics acquisitions in mid the decrease in base organic revenues in was due to a decrease in revenues in the americas of approximately million and asia pacific of approximately million  partially offset by an increase in revenues in europe of approximately million 
revenues from gm decreased million  or  in to million 
revenues from solutions consulting increased million  or  in to billion 
approximately million of the increase in is due to the acquisitions of sabre and systematics in mid  and the remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in revenues in europe 
revenues from our plm solutions line of business increased million  or  in to million 
this increase is the direct result of a full year of revenues recognized in related to our acquisition of sdrc in august organic revenues decreased in due to lower software and services revenues resulting from soft market conditions 
revenues from plm solutions increased million in to million 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to the acquisition of sdrc 
the decrease in revenues in the all other category in was primarily due to the relative decline of the euro and the british pound against their respective fixed currency exchange rates 
operating income 
management uses operating income  which consists of segment revenues less segment costs and expenses before acquired in process r d and other acquisition related costs  and restructuring and other charges to measure segment profit or loss 
the following table displays operating income by reportable segment for the years ended december   and in millions operating income expense operations solutions solutions consulting plm solutions all other total the operating margin for operations solutions was in compared with in and in operating income in was adversely affected by receivable reserves and asset writedowns totaling million related to our contractual relationships with worldcom and us airways  both of which filed for bankruptcy in excluding these items  the operating margin was in operating income in and includes amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets no longer amortized under sfas no 
excluding the impact of amortization expense related to these assets  the operating margins were in and in approximately basis points of the decrease in our operating margin in was due to loss accruals related to the financial performance of certain contracts  primarily in europe

excluding the impact of amortization expense related to these assets  the operating margins were in and in approximately basis points of the decrease in our operating margin in was due to loss accruals related to the financial performance of certain contracts  primarily in europe  and the remaining decrease is due to declines in higher margin discretionary it application spending by our clients as a result of general economic conditions and offshore competition 
as indicated above  a portion of the decrease in our operating margins for both operations solutions and solutions consulting in was attributable to loss accruals related to the financial performance of certain contracts  primarily in europe 
during  we accrued losses of approximately million on several contracts in both lines of business due to our projected inability to deliver contracted services at estimated cost levels not in excess of expected billings 
these loss accruals have also generally resulted from delays in the transition of existing client it operations to planned and more efficient it operating environments  and in one case  inadequate execution on a fixed price development contract 
we are implementing improvements with the intention that these factors will not result in additional loss accruals in or beyond  although there can be no assurance that further loss accruals will not be required

we have generally utilized commercial paper facilities to manage short term working capital fluctuations and as interim financing for acquisitions  although we expect to maintain outstanding commercial paper balances even when we may not require such funds in order to facilitate our access to commercial paper markets 
operating and capital leases are also used periodically to fund capital expenditures 
in december  eds information services  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of eds  contributed to the capital of and sold certain trade receivables to legacy receivables  llc  a limited liability company of which it is the sole member the llc  which then entered into a million revolving secured financing arrangement collateralized by those trade receivables 
at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the weighted average variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings was at december  maximum borrowings under the facility vary based on the eligible trade receivables held by the llc  however outstanding borrowings under the facility cannot exceed million 
the facility is subject to annual renewal and will expire in december in the event certain stated criteria are not complied with and a waiver is not granted  the facility may be terminated and amounts outstanding would be repaid through collection of the collateralized trade receivables 
events of termination under the facility include but are not limited to  our long term debt rating falling below bbb by standard poor s rating services s p or baa by moody s investor services  inc moody s  or events or collection trends materially negatively impacting the collateral 
proceeds from the sale of the trade receivables will be used for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our senior long term and commercial paper credit ratings by moody s  s p and fitch ratings fitch at february  moody s s p fitch senior long term debt baa a minus a minus short term debt prime a f we believe we will continue to have adequate access to the capital markets to meet our liquidity requirements and believe it is unlikely that the rating agencies would take any action that would materially impact our future access to the long term capital markets 
we have various commitments that require us to maintain specified investment grade debt ratings 
in the event we were to become noncompliant with these requirements and waivers are not granted  the related commitments may accelerate and become due immediately 
as a result of action by moody s in february to lower our long term credit rating to baa  one of our clients has the right to request repayment of the unused balance of a prepayment made for services which we continue to provide 
we estimate the unused balance of that prepayment will be approximately million at march  in accordance with the original client agreement  the prepayment was to be ratably applied against monthly client invoices through may we now expect the unused balance of the prepayment will be applied against monthly billings to that client beginning in april such that the balance is fully depleted by the end of july in addition  in the event of a downgrade to below bbb by s p or below baa by moody s  our remaining minimum purchase commitment under a software subscription agreement would become due immediately 
the balance of that commitment at december  was approximately million 
a reduction of our long term credit rating below bbb or baa by s p or moody s  respectively  would constitute a termination event under the revolving secured financing arrangement described above 
during  we initiated a program to manage the future stock issuance requirements of our employee stock incentive plans by utilizing equity investment contracts for eds common stock and purchasing shares in the open market 
prior to that time  we had solely purchased shares in the open market to manage such needs 
we purchased  shares in the open market under this program during in addition  we entered into equity investment contracts and put obligations during and to buy up to million shares of eds common stock 
we settled all of these contracts in through a series of purchases of million cumulative treasury shares of eds common stock for million at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the principal source of funding for these purchases was cash from operations and proceeds from commercial paper borrowings 
amounts paid upon the purchase of the underlying shares  net of put premiums of million  were recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
no equity investment contracts issued under this program were outstanding at december  we plan to continue a strategy of managing the future stock issuance requirements of our employee incentive plans through the purchase of eds common stock on the open market 
we do not currently expect to manage these requirements through the use of equity investment contracts  although we may elect to do so in the future 
we expect the holders of our zero coupon convertible notes issued in october will require us to redeem their notes in october for an aggregate redemption price of million 
we expect to fund this redemption from cash reserves 
in connection with certain service contracts  we may arrange a client supported financing transaction csft with our client and an independent third party financial institution or its designee or a securitization transaction where we sell certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract 
the use of these transactions enables us to offer clients more favorable financing terms 
these transactions also enable the preservation of our capital resources and allow us to avoid client credit risk relating to the repayment of the financed amounts 
under csft arrangements  the independent third party financial institution finances the purchase of certain it related assets and simultaneously leases those assets for use in connection with the service contract 
the use of a csft on a service contract results in lower contract revenue and expense to eds over the contract term 
under a securitization transaction  we purchase capital assets and sell certain financial assets resulting from the related service contract to a trust trust 
at december   the trust was capitalized with external borrowings of million and our residual beneficial interest of million 
the facility used by the trust for such borrowings is subject to annual renewal and terminates in september we have no effective control over the activities of the trust  and it is legally isolated from eds 
in the csft and securitization transactions  client payments are made directly to the financial institution or trust providing the financing 
if the client does not make the required payments under the service contract  under no circumstances do we have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless our nonperformance under the service contract would permit its termination  or we fail to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements  including  for example  covenants we have undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended purpose 
we consider the possibility of our failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote 
with respect to csfts  even in the event of our nonperformance under applicable contracts which would permit their termination  we would have no additional or incremental performance risk with respect to the ownership of the assets  because we would have owned or leased the same or substantially equivalent assets in order to fulfill our obligations under our service contracts 
with respect to the securitization transaction  in the event of a termination due to our nonperformance that triggers our obligation to acquire the underlying assets  we would have a legal claim against the client to recover the amount paid to acquire such assets 
performance under our service contracts is generally measured by contract terms relating to project deadlines  it system deliverables or level of effort measurements 
we reduce the risk of contract termination due to nonperformance through the use of a defined risk identification  review and mitigation process 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a related csft or securitization transaction 
since january   a total of billion of assets have been purchased using the financing arrangements referred to above 
at december   the estimated future asset purchases that can be financed under existing financing arrangements are approximately billion 
the aggregate dollar value of assets purchased under these financing transactions during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was outstanding an aggregate of million under csfts yet to be paid by our clients 
at that date  there were outstanding million of financial assets securitized by us and not yet paid by our client 
in the event a contract may be terminated due to nonperformance  we would be required to acquire only those assets associated with the outstanding amounts for that contract 
net of repayments  the estimated future maximum amount outstanding under existing financing arrangements is not expected to exceed billion 
we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of capital to directly finance the purchase of it capital assets to be used for current or future service contracts with or without the use of these transactions 
the following table summarizes csft and securitization financing activities since we began using these arrangements in in millions total csft securitiz ation total estimated draws under financings arranged  net of expirations estimated amounts not yet drawn total amounts drawn amounts repaid total outstanding at december  in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the possibility of which we believe is remote 
we believe we are in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee

in order to obtain favorable pricing and commercial terms for services necessary for the ongoing operation of our business  we have signed long term purchase agreements with certain software and telecommunications services providers 
under the terms of these agreements  we are contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over the next years 
if we fail to purchase the contractual minimums we have an obligation to pay the service provider the shortfall 
we believe these minimum purchase obligations will be met through the normal course of business 
the following table summarizes debt  lease and minimum purchase obligations outstanding as of december  in millions commitment per period total thereafter long term debt and secured revolving maturities forward stock sale commitment operating lease payments minimum purchase obligations total amounts due in include million of secured debt related to the sale of an interest in our trade receivables and million related to zero coupon convertible senior notes due but redeemable in whole or in part at the option of the holders in    and the forward stock sale commitment was entered into in connection with a june public security issuance 
see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect the principal use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  debt repayment and working capital 
capital expenditures may consist of purchases of computer and telecommunications equipment  software  land  buildings and facilities  as well as acquisitions and joint ventures 
during  and  capital expenditures totaled billion  billion and billion  respectively  excluding acquisition and joint venture activity 
in addition  csfts  securitization and leasing transactions during those years provided the estimated capital equivalent of million  million and million  respectively 
we estimate capital expenditures  excluding acquisition and joint venture activity  will total billion  and utilization of csfts  securitization and leasing transactions will provide the estimated capital equivalent of million in total capital expenditures may vary significantly and will depend to a significant extent on capital requirements for new business and the level of acquisition and joint venture activities  if any 
we anticipate that cash reserves  cash flows from operations  proceeds from divestitures and unused borrowing capacity under the existing lines of credit and client financing transactions will provide sufficient funds to meet our needs during market risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the issuance of short term commercial paper and variable rate notes 
however  the effects of interest rate changes are reduced by our management of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments as well as the utilization of interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  declines in the market price of our equity securities did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operation or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  the united kingdom  western european countries that use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with durations of generally less than days to hedge such transactions 
we have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
generally  foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
areas in which significant judgments and estimates are used include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  accounting for long lived assets  performance guarantees  litigation  accounts receivable collectibility and retirement plans 
revenue recognition 
we provide services under time and material  unit price or fixed price contracts which may extend up to or more years 
under time and material and certain unit price and fixed price contracts under which costs are generally incurred in proportion with contracted billing schedules  revenue is recognized when the client may be billed 
for certain unit price and fixed price contracts  we follow the guidance contained in aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for certain long term contracts that contain enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the contracting parties  consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  assuming reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and expenses can be made 
we use the cost to cost percentage of completion method whereby amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis 
costs associated with the purchase of long lived assets to be used on a specific contract are capitalized and excluded from current cumulative costs in calculating the percentage of services completed 
depreciation and amortization of such costs are included in such calculation over the period of use of the asset 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
if sufficient risk exists  a zero profit methodology is applied to a specific client contract s percentage of completion model whereby the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of costs incurred until such time as the risks have been partially or wholly mitigated through performance 
this methodology is primarily used at the inception of our largest it services contracts where the amount of profit to be recognized on a contract over its term is not yet determinable 
our estimates of revenues and expenses on client contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
in addition  the implementation of cost saving initiatives and achievement of productivity gains generally results in a reduction of estimated total contract expenses on affected client contracts 
for client contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  such changes would be reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
approximately of our it service contracts representing approximately of total revenues use the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
unbilled and deferred revenue were billion and million  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheet at december  the net change in unbilled and deferred revenue  which represents the difference between amounts billed in accordance with contractual terms and amounts recognized as revenue in our income statement  equated to of total revenues 
this net change was primarily associated with certain contracts requiring large upfront system development and construction efforts 
these contracts are structured in a manner that generally provides payment for these efforts over periods of time beginning subsequent to the completion of the development and construction efforts 
the nmci contract and the contracts with the uk government  referred to under financial position above  represent the largest contracts of this type 
excluding the nmci contract and these uk government contracts  the net change in unbilled and deferred revenue equated to of total revenues during long lived assets 
the following table presents goodwill balances at december  and operating income for the years ended december   and for each of our reportable segments in millions goodwill at december  operating income for the years ended operations solutions solutions consulting plm solutions goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we conducted a transitional goodwill impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
as of january   and an annual goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
our reporting units are our lines of business or the geographic components of our lines of business that share similar economic characteristics 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in both tests conducted in indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
we plan to conduct our annual impairment test as of december of each year when our budgets and operating plans for the forthcoming year are finalized 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
our property and equipment  software and definite lived intangible asset policies require the amortization or depreciation of assets over their estimated useful lives 
an asset s useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
the useful lives of property and equipment are limited to the lesser of standard depreciable lives or  for those assets dedicated to client contracts  the related contract term 
the useful lives of capitalized software are limited to the shorter of the license period or the related contract term 
the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangible assets are based on the expected use of the asset and factors that may limit the use of the asset 
we may utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser in the assessment of the useful life of an intangible asset 
liabilities 
when current estimates of total contract revenue and contract cost indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss is recognized in the period it becomes evident and  therefore  could have a significant impact on the company s earnings for such period 
provisions for loss are reported as cost of revenue in the consolidated income statement 
the same risks considered when recognizing revenue under the percentage of completion method are also considered when estimating contract loss for a particular contract 
during the year ended december   we accrued losses of approximately million on several contracts due to the lack of delivery of system deliverables in accordance with contractual milestones or our inability to deliver contracted services at cost levels that will not exceed expected billings 
loss accruals for contracts were not material for and in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the possibility of which we believe is remote 
at december   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds relating to these performance guarantees 
in addition  we had million outstanding under csft and securitization transactions that are supported by performance guarantees 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 
in addition  we had million of other financial guarantees outstanding at december  relating to indebtedness of others 
there are various claims and pending actions against eds arising in the ordinary course of the conduct of our business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current litigation 
certain of these actions seek damages in significant amounts 
among other things  we consider the period in which the underlying cause of the claim occurred  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the loss to determine whether a loss accrual and or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements is required 
the degree of probability and the loss related to a particular claim are typically estimated with the assistance of legal counsel 
accounts receivable 
reserves for uncollectible trade receivables are established when collection of amounts due from clients is deemed improbable 
indicators of improbable collection include client bankruptcy  client litigation  industry downturns  client cash flow difficulties or ongoing service or billing disputes 
receivables more than days past due are automatically reserved unless collection is deemed probable 
our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables  excluding unbilled receivables  were  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance in results from the recognition of reserves in connection with the worldcom and us airways bankruptcies 
excluding these reserves  the allowance percentage was at december  retirement plans 
we offer pension and other postretirement benefits to our employees through multiple global pension plans 
our largest pension plans are funded through our cash contributions and earnings on plan assets 
we use the actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to account for our pension plans 
two of the most significant actuarial assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined pension benefit plans are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate assumptions 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected long term rate of return that  over time  will approximate the actual long term returns earned on pension plan assets 
we base this assumption on historical five year actual returns as well as anticipated future returns based on our investment mix 
given our relatively young workforce  we are able to take a long term view of our pension investment strategy 
accordingly  plan assets are weighted heavily towards equity investments 
equity investments are susceptible to significant short term fluctuations but have historically outperformed most other investment alternatives on a long term basis 
at december   approximately of pension assets were invested in public and private equity and real estate investments with the remaining assets being invested in fixed income securities 
such mix is consistent with that assumed in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
rebalancing our actual asset allocations to our planned allocations based on actual performance has not been a significant issue 
a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations compared to a rate used in a basis point increase or decrease in this assumption results in an estimated pension expense decrease or increase  respectively  of million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
this rate reflects the underlying rate determined on the measurement date at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
high quality bond yields on our measurement date  october   with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods are used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
such maturities are currently estimated to be years 
a discount rate assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations  compared to a discount rate used in the methodology used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption has been consistently applied 
a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated decrease of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense  and a basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated increase of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
negative financial market returns in and have caused our actual pension plan asset returns to be less than the expected returns reflected in our assumptions 
our long standing policy of making consistent cash pension plan contributions has provided some protection against negative short term market returns 
however  despite these contributions  negative market returns have resulted in a decline in the fair value of our plan assets and declining discount rates have resulted in an increase in our pension liability over the last several years 
these factors have caused a significant decline in our pension plans funded status  which as of october   reflected total plan assets of billion and total accumulated benefit obligations under all plans of billion 
as a result  under the requirements of sfas no 
 we accrued an additional minimum pension plan liability  net of tax  of million during the fourth quarter of with a corresponding reduction in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
as a result of decreasing our weighted average long term rate of return assumption for plan assets as of january  to and the decline in the fair value of plan assets in  our pension expense will increase over by approximately million 
our required minimum amount of contributions will not exceed actual contributions made in however  we may elect to increase the level of contributions in over levels based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates  and changes in workforce compensation 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt this standard on january  the adoption of this standard will result in a cumulative effect adjustment of to per share on january  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which must be applied to all revenue arrangements entered into no later than june  however  the eitf is continuing discussion of the applicability of this issue to arrangements having one or more elements within the scope of higher level accounting literature  including sop eitf governs how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
if eitf were applicable to all of our contracts  we would be required to apply its segmentation criteria which are different from those contained in existing contract accounting literature 
such application could result in more segmentation of multiple element it services arrangements into separate accounting units 
the appropriate accounting literature for revenue recognition would then be applied to each unit 
assuming the segmentation criteria are met  the accounting for system design and development elements of multiple element it service contracts similar to those we typically enter into could continue to use the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
the accounting for this element  which usually occurs in the early stages of these contracts and has resulted in the recognition of the majority of our unbilled revenues  might not change as a result of the eitf 
revenue recognition for the segmented processing elements would likely occur on an as billed or straight line basis 
we cannot determine the ultimate impact of eitf on our business until the eitf resolves uncertainties regarding its scope 
in january  the fasb issued fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  consolidation occurs when one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
fin requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interests that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we are in the process of identifying our interest in variable interest entities to determine which  if any such entities  require consolidation under fin if we determine we should consolidate these entities  we would recognize certain assets and debt on our consolidated balance sheets and a cumulative adjustment for the accounting change in our consolidated statements of income
