this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements are generally characterized by terms such as believe  expect and may 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions  the company s actual results could differ materially from those given in the forward looking statements as a result of changes in factors which include among others  the following general economic and business conditions  which will  among other things  affect demand for retail and office space  demand for retail goods  availability and credit worthiness of the prospective tenants  lease rents and the terms and availability of financing  adverse changes in the real estate markets including  among other things  competition with other companies and technology  risks of real estate development and acquisition  governmental actions and initiatives  debt refinancing risk  conflicts of interests  maintenance of reit status and environmental safety requirements 
general the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of the company as of december  and for the year ended december  prior year data is based on the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for the years ended december  and critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the company s financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies which the company considers critical in that they may require judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
additional discussion of accounting policies which the company considers significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of real estate investments real estate investment properties are stated at historic cost basis less depreciation 
management believes that these assets have generally appreciated in value and  accordingly  the aggregate current value exceeds their aggregate net book value and also exceeds the value of the company s liabilities as reported in these financial statements 
because these financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  they do not report the current value of the company s real estate assets 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a real estate investment property  the company assesses an impairment in value by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of that property 
if such carrying amount is greater than the estimated projected cash flows  the company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
interest  real estate taxes and other carrying costs are capitalized on projects under construction 
once construction is substantially complete and the assets are placed in service  rental income  direct operating expenses  and depreciation associated with such properties are included in current operations 
in the initial rental operations of development projects  a project is considered substantially complete and available for occupancy upon completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity 
substantially completed portions of a project are accounted for as separate projects 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method and estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and up to years for certain other improvements 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the related leases using the straight line method 
lease acquisition costs certain initial direct costs incurred by the company in negotiating and consummating a successful lease are capitalized and amortized over the initial base term of the lease 
capitalized leasing costs consists of commissions paid to third party leasing agents as well as internal direct costs such as employee compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing leasing related activities 
such activities include evaluating the prospective tenant s financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees  collateral and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing lease documents and closing the transaction 
revenue recognition rental and interest income is accrued as earned except when doubt exists as to collectibility  in which case the accrual is discontinued 
when rental payments due under leases vary from a straight line basis because of free rent periods or scheduled rent increases  income is recognized on a straight line basis throughout the initial term of the lease 
expense recoveries represent a portion of property operating expenses billed to the tenants  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs 
expense recoveries are recognized in the period when the expenses are incurred 
rental income based on a tenant s revenues  known as percentage rent  is accrued when a tenant reports sales that exceed a specified breakpoint 
legal contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are generally covered by insurance 
while the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  the company believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or the results of operations 
once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be difficult to determine
