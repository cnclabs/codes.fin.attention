item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other various assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management under each applicable circumstance 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
sales terms to certain customers include remittance of discounts if certain conditions are met 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments our review of our long lived assets  principally fixed assets  and other intangibles requires us to initially estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of these assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
our review of goodwill is done annually in accordance with sfas as of december utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  as described in note to the accompanying financial statements  we are required to then estimate the fair value of the asset  determined by third party and internal appraisals and valuations  as deemed appropriate  or estimated discounted future cash flows  which includes making estimates of the timing of the future cash flows  discount rates and reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future sales and margin  operating  selling and administrative costs  interest and discount rates  technological changes  consumer demand and governmental regulations 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long lived assets and goodwill have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
environmental and litigation contingencies we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of our current environmental and litigation matters  reserves recorded and our position with respect to any related uncertainties 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation and environmental matters  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
dollars in thousands  except share data allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence reserves the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  this may result in an impairment of their ability to make payments to the company  and additional allowances may be required 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs deemed necessary by management 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowances primarily relate to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d many of the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility  ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on the calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is dollars in thousands  except share data generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording obligations under its plans are reasonably based on input from actuaries 
restatement of results cambrex corporation restated its results for the five year period from this restatement resulted from a fourth quarter management review of the inter company processes and controls which identified certain discrepancies in the inter company accounts 
based upon this review  the company has determined that certain administrative and other charges were not properly expensed in these prior periods 
the cumulative overstatement of earnings was approximately million before taxes or million  after taxes 
selling  general and administrative expenses were increased in   and by million  million  million and million  respectively  and decreased in by million 
net income was overstated by million  million  million and million in   and  respectively and understated by million in this restatement did not have any impact on the company s cash flows nor on reported results from operations

the effect of this adoption was to cease amortization of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets 
on a pro forma basis to reflect fasb no 
 net income would have been  versus the  reported last year 
the net income for was  versus  in the same period a year ago 
the results include special charges  before taxes  of   after taxes consisting of  for impaired assets and facility closure costs in the rutherford chemicals business   for rutherford goodwill impairment   for an accrual for vitamin b settlement and litigation costs   for an investment impairment  for a rutherford inventory write off and  for severance costs 
the inventory write off is recorded in cost of goods sold  the investment impairment is recorded in other expenses and all other items above have been charged to operating expenses 
in addition  the results also include special benefit items  before taxes of   after taxes comprised of a  benefit from the final insurance claim settlement related to the previously disclosed reactor outage at a rutherford chemicals site  which is recorded against cost of goods sold and a  favorable arbitration award within rutherford chemicals related to a disputed product line agreement which is recorded in other income 
the award reimbursed the company for lost profits for the years through all items have been charged to operating expenses with the exception of the inventory write off and insurance benefit which are reflected in cost of goods sold  the investment impairment and favorable arbitration award which are reflected in other expenses

see notes   and for further discussion of these special items 
the reported results reflect higher sales in the human health and biosciences segments  higher margins in the biosciences segment  the favorable special items noted above  and the reduced amortization expense as a result of the adoption of fasb no 
these items are partly offset by lower sales in rutherford dollars in thousands  except share data chemicals and all other segments  higher administrative expenses and higher interest costs due to funding the acquisitions 
gross sales for increased to  from  in sales in the biosciences and human health segments increased compared to more than offsetting the decrease in the rutherford chemicals and all other segments 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on gross sales for the year resulted in an increase in sales of  or compared to gross sales would have been  using exchange rates compared to sales of  the favorable effects of foreign currencies are attributable primarily to significant exchange rate fluctuations in the euro  swedish krona and pounds sterling against the us dollar in the human health segment gross sales of  were  or above gross sales were above the prior year primarily due to sales of a new amphetamine product used to treat attention deficit disorder  higher sales of gastrointestinal api s to meet increased demand  continued growth of a pharmaceutical intermediate used in therapeutic treatment of end state kidney disease  higher market share in imaging products worldwide  and higher sales of central nervous system api s due to increased worldwide demand 
partly offsetting these increases was lower sales of cardiovascular actives due to customer inventory reductions and competitive pressures  lower sales of an antihistamine product due to fall off in customer demand and the effect of a smaller shipment made in vs 
of an anti infective product for use in clinical trials 
human health segment sales growth would have been without the currency impact of the weaker us dollar 
the biosciences segment gross sales of  increased in compared to the prior year period primarily due to the impact of the biopharmaceutical manufacturing acquisitions completed during the second half of sales growth of excluding the effect of the acquisitions  and increased sales of endotoxin protection products reflecting the impact of a more focused sales force and introduction of fda compliant software in mid  higher media and serum sales primarily liquid form due to market share gains in europe and strong shipments of normal human cells reflecting improved product supply and quality 
these increases were partly offset by the impact of the sale of the ivd cell business during the first quarter of bioscience segment sales growth would have been without the currency impact of the weaker us dollar 
the rutherford chemicals segment gross sales of  in declined  or versus  reflecting lower demand and timing of production campaigns for crop protection products  lower demand for certain performance enhancing chemicals  and continued weakness in the telecommunications and industrial coatings industries 
these decreases were partly offset by increased sales of feed additive and a polymer product produced overseas due to successful price negotiations with customer 
the all other segment gross sales of  in were  or below the prior year period of  reflecting lower feed additive sales due to customer inventory management  and the impact of a customer bringing in house the manufacture of a performance enhancing polymer product  as well as customer inventory build ups on another performance enhancing polymer product 
export sales from us businesses of  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in the  of sales in consisted of    and  to north america  europe  asia and rest of world  respectively 
gross profit in was  compared to  in gross margin in increased to from in included in the gross margins is a  benefit from an insurance settlement recorded against cost of goods sold 
this item concerns a rutherford chemicals business 
margins also include a special charge of in the third quarter for a rutherford chemicals inventory write down related to the rutherford chemicals asset impairments 
these items increased the overall gross margin by 
the human health gross margins were up slightly compared to the prior year due to a dollars in thousands  except share data favorable product mix  which was aided by the company s hedging strategy and overall higher production in most european plants 
the bioscience segment margins increased slightly due to favorable product mix and higher volumes in the base business partly offset by under absorption of fixed costs at the biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing sites 
excluding the favorable items discussed above  lower rutherford chemicals and all other segment margins primarily reflect lower volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in  compared to on a pro forma basis considering adoption of sfas no 
for the same period in higher administrative costs  excluding the impact of sfas  were due primarily to the impact of the second half biopharmaceutical manufacturing acquisitions  a reduction of environmental accruals in the second quarter  and higher insurance premiums and employee benefit expenses in research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  compared to  or of gross sales in  reflecting staff reductions mainly in rutherford chemicals locations 
the operating profit in was  compared to  in  on a pro forma basis considering adoption of sfas no 

the results reflect higher sales in the human health and biosciences segments  higher margins in the bioscience segment  the favorable insurance settlement noted above and the reduced amortization expense as a result of the adoption of fasb no 
 offset by lower sales in rutherford chemicals and all other segments  and higher administrative expenses 
net interest expense of  in increased from reflecting the higher average debt balance due to financing of the acquisitions  partly offset by lower average interest rates 
the average interest rate was for the year versus in the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective rate of as compared with in the same period of the decrease reflects the tax effect of the restructuring and special charges  a change in the geographic mix of income and the impact of the continuing r d tax credit programs 
compared to gross sales in increased to  from  in sales in human health and biosciences increased and  respectively compared to and more than offset the decreases in rutherford chemicals which were down and all other segments which were down 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on gross sales for the year had a negative impact on sales of or  compared to gross sales would have been  in  using exchange rates compared to sales of  the unfavorable effects of foreign currencies are attributable primarily to exchange rate fluctuations in the italian lira  swedish krona  pounds sterling and irish punt against the us dollar in the human health segment gross sales of  were  or above due primarily to higher sales of generics used in cardiovascular  central nervous systems and gastrointestinal preparations and new product introductions  including an intermediate used in a product to treat end stage kidney disease and actives used in insomnia and prostate cancer treatment products 
these increases were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currencies which reduced sales by or million  and lower sales of a cardiovascular supplement  due to a price decrease 
this price decrease was offset by lower manufacturing cost reflecting a change in chemical processing 
in addition  lower sales were experienced in a generic used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis due to competitive pricing pressure and in a gastrointestinal active due to a customer decision to bring manufacturing in house 
the biosciences segment gross sales of  were  or above primarily due to the acquisition of cambrex bio science baltimore  inc in june  and cambrex bio science hopkinton  inc in october  as well as increased shipments of cell culture  including liquid media  flex pack and powder dollars in thousands  except share data formulations 
in addition  endotoxin detection sales increased due to more focused marketing and production efforts 
the rutherford chemicals segment gross sales of  were  or below due to lower sales in telecommunications  coatings  and performance enhancing products and weak photographic demand 
reduced sales in telecommunications and coating products have been influenced by a general economic slowdown in those industries

export sales from us businesses of  in compared to  in international sales from european operations totaled  in compared to  in the  of sales in consisted of    and  to north america  europe  asia and rest of world  respectively 
total gross profit of  was  above due to increased gross profit in the biosciences segment  due to higher volume in the base businesses  and the impact of two contract biopharmaceutical manufacturing acquisitions completed during the year 
the human health segment also benefited from increased volume  as well as favorable product mix 
these increases resulted despite special charges for inventory write offs recorded in the fourth quarter of  in the biosciences segment and  in the rutherford chemicals segment for discontinued products see note for further discussion of these charges 
the biosciences segment inventory write off was related to excess and obsolete inventories 
the higher gross profits in the human health and biosciences segments were partly offset by lower gross profits and margins in the rutherford chemicals and all other segments  both of which were primarily impacted by lower volumes 
in addition  the rutherford chemicals segment was impacted by increased raw material and energy costs during the year 
the overall gross margin of  including the fourth quarter inventory write downs of  was approximately flat compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of gross sales were in versus for administration costs increased due to the added costs and higher amortization expense associated with the june cambrex bio science baltimore  inc acquisition  the full year impact of the august arizona product line license and october cambrex bio science hopkinton  inc acquisition  as well as additional sales and marketing costs in the biosciences segment 
in addition  the company experienced higher insurance premiums during compared to in the fourth quarter  as a result of the company s previously announced business restructuring which created rutherford chemicals  inc  together with an impairment charge within those businesses  the company incurred restructuring and other charges of  comprised of asset write downs of  and severance costs of  see note for further discussion of these charges 
in  the company increased its provision for potential settlements and legal costs related to vitamin b litigation by  see note for further discussion of this charge 
research and development expenses of  were of gross sales in  and were above levels by  or of gross sales 
this increase was associated with the strengthening of the r d group in the biosciences segment and costs associated with the expansion of the cambrex center of technical excellence 
the operating profit in was  compared to  in this decrease reflects the special charges discussed above  weakness in the gross margin and profit in the non life science businesses  higher research and development spending and amortization costs associated with acquisitions 
this decrease is partly offset by the higher gross profit in the human health and biosciences businesses 
net interest expense of  in reflected a decrease of from reflecting lower average interest rates  partly offset by a higher average debt balance due to financing of acquisitions and lower interest dollars in thousands  except share data income in due to a temporary cash buildup in the average interest rate was in versus in the provision for income taxes in resulted in an effective rate of versus in the decrease in the tax rate was due to the favorable outcome of tax audits and r d tax credit programs 
in addition  the company continues to benefit from international tax treaties and foreign income taxed at a lower overall effective tax rate as compared to the us statutory rate 
the company s net income in decreased to  which includes  after tax impact of restructuring  vitamin b provision and other charges compared with net income of  in liquidity and capital resources net cash flow from operations was  for the year ended december   up from  in the increase in cash flow is due primarily to an insurance recovery during the year  increases in current and long term liabilities and lower inventory purchases versus the prior year 
in  the company received approximately  in an insurance settlement related to mechanical problems with a reactor at one of its chemicals facilities 
current liabilities were higher due to an increase in the estimated vitamin b litigation settlement and legal costs  higher current pension liabilities  and the timing of various payments 
long term liabilities increased over prior year due to higher pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities 
cash flows used in investing activities included capital expenditures of  cash flows used in financing activities of  included net repayments of debt of  payment of dividends of  and the purchase of treasury stock of  partially offset by  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options

in november  the company entered into a  revolving credit agreement with a group of banks led by jpmorganchase as the lead agency bank 
the agreement consisted of a day renewable senior revolving credit facility for  and a year senior revolving credit facility for  in november  the day senior revolving credit facility matured and was successfully renewed 
the current capacity for the senior revolving credit facility is  under the day facility and  under the five year facility  for a total of  the five year agreement expires in november the revolving credit agreement allows the company to choose among various interest rate options and to specify the portion of the borrowing to be covered by specific interest rates 
under the revolving credit agreement the interest rate options available to the company are the following us prime rate  libor plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to  or money market rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 
to the applicable rate margin or credit spread on outstanding debt is based upon the ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated modified ebitda 
the company also pays a facility fee between 
to 
on the entire revolving credit facility 
the and average interest rates were and  respectively 
the undrawn borrowing under the agreement as of december  was  of this amount   is available to be borrowed due to limits established in the revolving credit agreement 
there was  outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands  except share data at december  our contractual obligations with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows total long term debt       operating leases       contractual cash obligations       see notes and in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding our debt and other commitments 
management believes that existing sources of capital  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
a key to our access to liquidity is the maintenance of our strong long term credit ratings and ability to meet debt covenants to maintain certain levels of net worth  an interest coverage ratio and leverage ratios 
the company met all bank covenants during and does not anticipate any covenant compliance issues in the coming year 
management also believes that the company will maintain its strong long term credit ratings 
any events which change the status of our ability to meet debt covenants or maintain our credit ratings could adversely impact our ability to fund operations 
our forecasted cash flow from future operations may be adversely affected by various factors including  but not limited to  declines in customer demand  increased competition  the deterioration in general economic and business conditions  as well as other factors 
any change in the current status of these factors could adversely impact the company s ability to fund operating cash flow requirements 
effective january   the operating units that primarily produce specialty and fine chemicals and animal health and agriculture products were combined under a new business unit  rutherford chemicals  inc rutherford chemicals  inc includes caschem  inc  bayonne  new jersey  cosan chemical corporation  carlstadt  new jersey  heico chemicals  inc  delaware water gap  pennsylvania  nepera  inc  harriman  new york  zeeland chemicals  inc  zeeland  michigan  and seal sands chemicals  limited  middlesbrough  united kingdom 
in the fourth quarter  the company announced that it had engaged a financial advisor to assist the company in investigating strategic alternatives for the rutherford chemicals segment 
financial instruments the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  the company uses a variety of techniques and instruments  including derivatives  as part of its overall risk management strategy 
currency risk management the company s primary market risk relates to exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by international operations which are primarily denominated in the us dollar  euro currency  swedish krona and british pound sterling 
the company currently uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of short term foreign exchange rate movements on the company s operating results 
the notional amount of these contracts at december  was  which includes inter company contracts of  the company estimates the forward contracts to be approximately of the non local currency exposure during the period 
unrealized foreign exchange contract losses do not subject the company s actual results to risk as gains or losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the transactions that are hedged 
given a scenario that the operating companies non local currency collections match their forecasts  and all exchange rates move against their local currencies  no more than  of pre tax profits for a twelve month period would be at risk 
this is based on unhedged risk of  this residual risk allows for an over dollars in thousands  except share data forecasting margin of error and prevents over hedging of actual operating risk 
as of december   the non local forecasted currency exposures were  offsetting this exposure are expected  us dollar inter company payments from the combined european sites 
the remaining  forecasted exposure was partially hedged  with major banks and through offsetting inter company hedge contracts to reduce the non hedged risk to  interest rate management each of the interest rate options in the revolving credit agreement includes floating rates 
this arrangement has the advantage of making lower interest rates available in a declining rate market 
however  it also exposes the company to any upward swings in interest rates 
for example  based on the company s current net debt outstanding  an unexpected annual interest rate increase of basis points could increase interest expense and thus decrease the company s after tax profitability by approximately  to limit the risk of interest rates rising above a tolerable level  the company would pay a premium now in order to obtain a fixed interest rate at a predetermined cost in the future 
that swap stabilizes interest costs by converting floating or variable rates to fixed rates through a contract with a financial institution 
the company monitors the debt position and market trends to protect it from any unforeseen shifts in interest rates 
the company has employed a plan to mitigate interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements to convert floating rates to fixed interest rates 
as of december   the company had seventeen interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional value of  at an average fixed rate of  and with varying maturity dates through the year the company s strategy has been to cover a portion of outstanding bank debt with interest rate protection 
at december   the coverage was approximately 
environmental in connection with laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment  the company is a party to several environmental remediation investigations and cleanups and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites superfund sites 
each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters will be decided unfavorably against the company 
the company had accruals  included in other non current liabilities  of  and  at december  and  respectively  for costs associated with the study and remediation of superfund sites and the company s current and former operating sites for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company s accrual represents management s best estimate of what it believes are the reasonably possible and estimated environmental cleanup related costs of a non capital nature 
during the past three year period  there were no cash payments for environmental cleanup related matters 
in  a provision of was recorded for a chemical site as a result of the development of an initial remediation estimate based on the current conclusions of the ongoing investigation of the site 
there were no provisions recorded for environmental contingencies in the company reduced reserves by approximately and  during and  respectively  as a result of revised estimates based on information obtained from continued investigation and remedial plan development and resolution of proceedings related to superfund site owners and insurers 
in addition  the company settled certain environmental claims involving the cosan chemical corporation a subsidiary with insurance companies for  in and  in after reviewing information currently available  management believes any amounts paid in excess of the accrued liabilities will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters  if resolved in a manner different from those assumed in the current estimates  could have a material adverse effect on financial condition  operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
dollars in thousands  except share data litigation the company and its subsidiary profarmaco srl currently known as cambrex profarmaco milano srl were named as defendants in a proceeding instituted by the federal trade commission ftc on december   in the united states district court for the district of columbia 
the complaint alleged that exclusive license agreements which cambrex profarmaco milano srl entered into with mylan laboratories  inc mylan covering the drug master files for and therefore the right to buy and use two active pharmaceutical ingredients apis  lorazepam and clorazepate  were part of an effort on mylan s part to restrict competition in the supply of lorazepam and clorazepate and to increase the price charged for these products when mylan sold them as generic pharmaceuticals 
the complaint further alleged that these agreements violated the federal trade commission act  and that mylan  cambrex  cambrex profarmaco milano srl  and gyma laboratories of america  inc  cambrex profarmaco milano srl s distributor in the united states  engaged in an unlawful restraint of trade and conspired to monopolize and attempted to monopolize the markets for the generic pharmaceuticals incorporating the api s 
a lawsuit making similar allegations against the company and cambrex profarmaco milano srl  and seeking injunctive relief and treble damages  was filed by the attorneys general of states in the united states district court for the district of columbia on behalf of those states and persons in those states who were purchasers of the generic pharmaceuticals 
the company and cambrex profarmaco milano srl have also been named in purported class action complaints brought by private plaintiffs in various state courts on behalf of purchasers of lorazepam and clorazepate in generic form  making allegations essentially similar to those raised in the ftc s complaint and seeking various forms of relief including treble damages 
on february   a federal court in washington  dc entered an order and stipulated permanent injunction as part of a settlement of the ftc and attorneys general s suits 
under these settlement documents mylan agreed to pay over  on its own behalf and on behalf of most of the other defendant companies including cambrex and cambrex profarmaco milano srl in the order and injunction  the settling defendants also agreed to monitor certain future conduct 
the private litigation continues 
the company strongly believes that its licensing arrangements with mylan were made in accordance with regulatory requirements 
however  the company and mylan terminated the exclusive license to the drug master files as of december  in entering these licensing arrangements  the company elected not to raise the price of its products and had no control or influence over the pricing of its final generic product 
mylan had been fully covering the costs for the defense and indemnity of cambrex and cambrex profarmaco milano srl under certain obligations set forth in the license agreements 
cambrex agreed to cover separate legal defense costs incurred for cambrex and cambrex profarmaco milano srl on a going forward basis beginning august  the company recently entered into discussions with mylan regarding the final resolution of all outstanding claims 
the outcome of these discussions is not currently determinable 
on may   the company s nepera subsidiary  a manufacturer and seller of niacinamide vitamin b  received a federal grand jury subpoena for the production of documents relating to the pricing and possible customer allocation with regard to that product 
the company understands that the subpoena was issued as part of the federal government s ongoing anti trust investigation into various business practices in the vitamin industry generally 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reached a settlement with the government concerning nepera s alleged role in vitamin b violations from to on october   the government settlement was finalized with nepera entering into a voluntary plea agreement with the department of justice 
under this agreement  nepera entered a plea of guilty to one count of price fixing and market allocation of vitamin b from to in violation of section one of the sherman act and has agreed to pay a fine of approximately  under the plea agreement  nepera was on probation for a one year period which has ended 
the fine was paid in february nepera has been named as a defendant  along with several other companies  in a number of private civil actions brought on behalf of alleged purchasers of vitamin b dollars in thousands  except share data an accrual of  was recorded in the fourth quarter to cover the anticipated government settlements  related litigation  and legal expenses 
based on discussions with various plaintiffs counsel  as well as then current estimates of expenditures for legal fees  an additional accrual of  was established in the fourth quarter of the company believed that the current reserves would be sufficient to cover resolution of the remaining related litigation matters 
however  during  based on ongoing negotiations and other information developed during the year  the company determined that the remaining litigation matters would be more costly than previously anticipated 
therefore  during the third and fourth quarters of  the company increased reserves by  and  respectfully 
the balance of this accrual as of december  was approximately  this accrual has been recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
while it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of the above litigation matters and various other lawsuits  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
these matters  if resolved in an unfavorable manner  could have a material effect on the operating results and cash flows when resolved in a future reporting period 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the standard requires that legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recorded at fair value when incurred and was adopted by the company on january  adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas primarily addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas became effective on january  for long lived assets to be held and used  the new rules continue previous guidance to recognize impairment when the undiscounted cash flows will not recover its carrying amount 
the impairment to be recognized will continue to be measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
the computation of fair value now removes goodwill from consideration and incorporates a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach 
the previous guidance provided in sfas is to be applied to assets to be disposed of by sale 
long lived assets to be disposed by other than sale will now recognize impairment at the date of disposal  but will be considered assets to be held and used until that time 
the company adopted sfas as of january  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no
