item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company designs and markets storage systems that help people protect  secure  capture and share their valuable digital information 
the company s products are organized into two broad business categories a mobile and desktop storage systems and b network storage systems 
mobile and desktop storage systems include magnetic drives and disks marketed under the zip trademark  optical drives marketed under the iomega cd rw trademark as well as portable and desktop hard disk drives hdd  iomega mini usb drives and various software titles 
network storage systems include a wide selection of network attached storage nas servers in capacities from gb to gb that supplement the storage capacity of company networks in small and medium size businesses and enterprise workgroups 
beginning in the second half of  the company s new management team sought to implement a three stage corporate plan to restructure for profitability  improve operational efficiencies and ultimately grow the company 
in its efforts to return to profitability  the company implemented a significant reorganization of its operations and products  recording non restructuring charges of million and restructuring charges of million in during  the company reported net income of million on sales of million which compares to a net loss in of million on sales of million 
with the company being profitable during  management succeeded in achieving the first two parts of its three part turnaround plan 
however  during  the company was unable to reverse the trend of sales declines 
the sales decline is primarily the result of the continuing contraction of the zip business 
the launch of the zip mb drive in august of is expected to extend the life cycle of zip products and the company expects sales of zip mb drives to continue to increase in but not result in an increase in overall zip sales for despite the company s efforts to promote its zip products  the company expects the sales from zip products to continue to decline 
although the company introduced several new mobile and desktop products in to leverage the iomega brand in a variety of categories  the sales from those new products did not offset the decline in zip sales 
the company s new sourced product businesses portable and desktop hdd drives and the new iomega mini usb drives continue to grow and the company has the goal to improve the procurement and commodity business processes to maximize profitability on these products 
management also believes the company s nas servers represent a good business opportunity for the company as its lead initiative into the growing network storage systems market for small and medium size businesses 
the company s goal is to grow nas products as a percentage of total company sales by the second half of during  the company achieved a key operational initiative with the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary to venture corporation limited venture 
the company also entered into a five year manufacturing services agreement with venture and the company s former penang manufacturing subsidiary for the manufacture and supply of zip drives and certain other products 
during  the company also outsourced its european distribution logistics center and outsourced its asian distribution center  following the outsourcing of the north american distribution and logistics center 
as a result of the company s outsourcing efforts and the focus on cost efficiencies  the company believes it will be more nimble and focused on leveraging its core competencies of product generation  removable magnetic storage technology and global distribution under the iomega brand 
during  the company plans to work on a number of key initiatives  including the goal of creating destination storage in the retail environment 
anchored around zip products  the company plans to leverage its brand equity  its retail presence and its product management expertise to offer multiple storage products in the mobile and desktop storage category 
however  due to the uncertainties and competitiveness of the retail environment and the economics among the company s retail customers  the company cannot be certain that the destination storage initiative will be embraced by all retail partners or fully deployed by those who do initiate it 
in the network storage systems marketplace  the company is evaluating tape products as an important building block for the small to medium size business customers who need products to enable long term archiving 
also during  the company is repositioning its research and development resources to develop new removable magnetic storage technologies 
along with these new product developments  the company is now working to develop original equipment manufacture oem partnerships with the goal to enable widespread adoption of these new technologies in the company does not expect any sales from these new technologies until the company has significant cash and cash equivalent balances cash reserves 
the company believes that these cash reserves are in excess of what is required to operate the existing business on an ongoing basis 
therefore  the company expects to continue to analyze strategic opportunities to utilize its cash reserves  which are excess to the existing business expected requirements  both in and outside the storage industry with the goal to obtain the maximum benefit for our shareholders 
the company s profitability will depend upon its ability to minimize  to the extent possible  the decline in zip unit volumes and sales until other profitable sources of sales can be generated 
for example  during  the product profit margin ppm for the zip business including impairment charges was million compared to a product loss of million on all other products 
in summary  given that zip products accounted for of the company s sales in and are declining  and given that it will take time for the various initiatives that the company has underway to generate significant amounts of sales  management anticipates sales and operating profits to decline compared to management also believes that the gross margin percentages reported for will be difficult to achieve in future periods 
application of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and are susceptible to material changes from period to period include revenue recognition  price protection and rebate reserves  marketing program accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory valuation reserves 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
revenue recognition the company defers recognition of sales on estimated excess inventory in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
for this purpose  excess inventory is the amount of inventory that exceeds the channels four week requirements as estimated by management 
excess channel inventory is only estimated for the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
the oem and value added resellers vars customers are not considered to have excess inventory as they tend to not carry more than four weeks of inventory 
the channel s four week requirements are estimated based on inventory and sell through amounts reported weekly to the company by the company s key customers  who make up the majority of the company s sales in the distribution  retail and catalog channels 
no adjustment is made for those customers that do not report inventory and sell through information 
this inventory and sell through information is reported to the company at the stock keeping unit sku level 
however  for purposes of the excess inventory calculation  this information is accumulated at the major product level ie zip mb drive  zip mb drive  etc 
the company uses the last weeks of reported sell through information to calculate a weekly average  which is then used to estimate the channel s four week requirements 
this estimate may not be indicative of four weeks of future sell through 
the company defers sales and cost of sales associated with estimated excess channel inventory in the consolidated statements of operations  with the resulting offset being reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in margin on deferred revenue 
at december   the company had million in margin on deferred revenue associated with excess channel inventory  which reflected a deferral of million and million of sales and cost of sales  respectively 
at december   the company had million in margin on deferred revenue associated with excess channel inventory  which reflected a deferral of million and million of sales and cost of sales  respectively 
the increase in the reserve for resulted primarily from higher levels of zip channel inventory and lower zip sell through rates 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to excess channel inventory is a critical accounting estimate because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the variability of the different inputs to the calculation of the reserve such as changes in the level of channel inventory and channel sell through rates the material impact that changes in these inputs can have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue and the material impact that a change in methodology in calculating the company s four week requirement could have on sales  cost of sales and margin on deferred revenue 
excess channel inventory is a critical estimate for all segments of the company s business 
since the company has no material debt and high cash balances  the company believes that changes in excess channel inventory accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
price protection and rebate reserves the company has agreements with certain of its customers which  in the event of a price decrease  allow those customers subject to limitations a credit equal to the difference between the price originally paid and the new decreased price on units in the customers inventories on the date of the price decrease not to exceed the number of units shipped to the customer for a specified time period prior to the price decrease 
when a price decrease is anticipated  the company establishes reserves against gross trade receivables with the corresponding reduction in sales for estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers 
in addition  the company records reserves at the time of shipment for estimated volume rebates and other estimated rebates given to consumers at time of purchase from channel partners for which sales have been recognized 
estimates for rebates are based on a number of variable factors that depend on the specific program or product 
these variables include the anticipated redemption rate of rebates  anticipated sales volumes in the channel  the perceived consumer value of the rebate and historical experience 
changes in any of these variables would have a direct impact on the amount of the recorded reserves 
the company uses price protection and rebate programs in all of its segments and the statement of operations charges are recorded against their respective segment 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to price protection and rebate programs is a critical accounting estimate because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the assumptions made concerning redemption rates and the material impact that changes in this reserve can have on sales and receivables reserves 
reserves for volume and other rebates and price protection totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are netted against trade receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 
the decrease in this reserve for was primarily a reflection of lower rebate and price protection programs during and a million release of rebate and price protection accruals recorded in prior periods that were not claimed as originally estimated 
the company believes that the use of rebates will continue to be a significant part of the company s business strategy 
since the company has no material debt and high cash balances  the company believes that changes in price protection and rebate accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
marketing program accruals the company  as part of its normal operations  has entered into contracts with many of the company s distribution and retail customers whereby the customer is allowed to use a set percentage of its purchases of the company s products for various marketing purposes 
the purpose of these contracts is to encourage advertising and promotional events to promote the sale of the company s products 
the company also contracts with various third parties to support these customer programs 
the company accrues for the estimated costs of these marketing programs with the customers and third parties in accordance with the contractual percentage of product sold to the respective customer and the estimated support costs during the period that the product is sold or the period that the support costs are incurred 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the adequacy of these marketing program accruals 
in addition  the company evaluates the specific programs for proper classification of these costs in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to marketing program accruals is a critical accounting estimate because changes in these accruals can have a material impact on selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and on accrued marketing in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company makes estimates regarding marketing programs in all of the company s segments and the statement of operations impact is either specifically identified by segment or allocated across all segments depending upon the nature of the program 
at december   these accrued marketing costs totaled million  compared to million at december  the decrease in accrued marketing costs during was attributable to lower accruals resulting from a combination of lower sales and fewer marketing programs during and the release of million of marketing accruals that related primarily to changes in estimates associated with various programs the company implemented during and as the company attempted to reverse the declining trends of revenue 
the company s previous accrual process combined with the lag times associated with customer claims and the high volume of programs during and made it difficult to determine when the individual marketing claims were actually completed 
in conjunction with this  it was also anticipated that there would be full participation by all customers but it was difficult to determine the actual liability until a full review of all customer deductions had been completed 
in several instances  some customers subsequently chose not to participate in the marketing programs 
customers routinely deduct from their payments those items that it believes the company owes the customer for market development funds and other programs 
with some programs  customers were entitled to incentive sales payments and the reserves remained until the deductions came through 
in some cases  the customer combined the deduction with other claims 
the company continues to review each individual marketing program as more information becomes available through the passage of time to verify the adequacy of its related accruals which resulted in the million release of marketing program accruals that occurred throughout since the company has no material debt and high cash balances  the company believes that changes in marketing program accruals would not impact the company s liquidity 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records its trade receivables at sales value and establishes a non specific allowance for estimated doubtful accounts by applying specified percentages to the different receivable aging categories 
the percentage applied against the aging categories increases as the accounts become further past due 
accounts in excess of days past due are fully reserved 
in addition  specific reserves are established for specific customer accounts identified as known collection problems whether due to insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
the amounts of these specific reserves are estimated by management based on the following assumptions variables customer s financial position  age of the customer s receivables and changes in payment schedules 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the addition or removal of reserves for specific customer accounts and the material impact that changes in specific customer reserves can have on bad debt expense in the consolidated statement of operations and on trade receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
the statement of operations impact of adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts is allocated to the company s segments based on a percentage of sales 
the company s customer base is quite concentrated and changes in either the customer s financial position or the economy as a whole could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated reserve 
for example  at december   the customers with the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances totaled million  or of the gross trade receivables  compared to million  or of gross trade receivables  at december  at december   the largest outstanding trade receivables balance from one customer was million  or of gross trade receivables  compared to the trade receivables balance from the largest customer of million  or of gross trade receivables  at december  if any one or a group of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
during  the allowance for doubtful accounts included increases of million for reserves established for specific customers million for a u 
s customer and million for european customers 
the specific reserve was recorded for the us customer because the company felt that this customer s financial position was seriously deteriorating  the age of the customer s account and several failed collection attempts 
the specific reserves were recorded for the european customers because the company had cancelled distribution contracts early in the fourth quarter of and these customers were refusing to pay on their accounts 
during  the allowance for bad debt expense decreased million  of which million was the result of decreases in specific reserves 
during  the company reached a settlement with the us customer and released million of the reserve and the majority of the million specific reserve for european customers was released as the customers paid on a majority of their balances  with only a minimal portion being utilized 
the remaining million decrease was a result of lower receivables and improved agings 
since the company has no material debt and high cash balances  the company believes that changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts would not impact the company s liquidity 
inventory valuation reserves the company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices including known future price decreases 
the company includes product costs and direct selling expenses in its analysis of inventory realization 
to the extent that estimated selling prices do not exceed such costs and expenses  valuation reserves are established against inventories 
in addition  the company generally considers inventory on hand which is not expected to be utilized within the next nine months  as forecasted by the company s material requirements planning systems  as excess and thus appropriate reserves are established through a charge to cost of sales 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to inventory valuation reserves is a critical accounting estimate because the reserve is highly susceptible to change from period to period due primarily to estimating future sales volumes of product and future sales prices  the competitive nature of the computer storage industry which can quickly change the price of the company s products in the market place or the overall demand for the company s products and the material impact that changes in the value of inventory can have on cost of sales and inventory valuation reserves 
it is particularly difficult to estimate inventory levels and future sales prices on new and end of life products 
inventory valuation reserve adjustments are necessitated primarily from changes in estimating future sales volumes and from changes in the estimates made of future sales prices 
estimating future sales volumes and future sales prices is particularly difficult for new products such as hdd drives and iomega mini usb drives  end of life products and for cd rw 
the price competition and short product life cycles of cd rw drives makes it difficult to estimate both future sales and future sales price levels 
zip products have shown a long market life compared to the company s other products and combined with the high margins associated with zip products  they have historically not been as susceptible to inventory valuation reserve adjustments as some of the company s other products 
also  purchase order commitments for the majority of zip components are extended for no greater than three months so that any drop off in demand can be mitigated by curtailing future purchase orders 
however  as zip sales continue to decline and it becomes more difficult to predict future sales volumes and future sales prices  zip products may become more susceptible to inventory valuation reserves 
during  the company recorded net inventory write offs of million which were recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations  primarily for end of life products 
of this million  million was classified as part of the company s non restructuring charges and is described in more detail in the non restructuring charges section below 
the remaining million of inventory write offs was considered normal recurring operations 
during  the company recorded a net release of inventory reserves of million which were recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
this million net release was comprised of million of inventory write offs related to peerless and nas and were considered normal recurring operations and were more than offset by million in inventory reserve releases into cost of goods sold as product that had been previously reserved was sold 
as product is sold below cost  inventory reserves previously established are utilized to bring the product to a break even point as the loss on the product has already been recognized in prior periods 
as the company continues to offer new products or exits product lines  there is no assurance that further inventory valuation reserves will not be required 
at december   the company had inventory valuation reserves of million which compares to inventory valuation reserves of million at december  the decrease in inventory reserves during was primarily attributable to the utilization of the inventory valuation reserves established during adjustments to the inventory reserves are a non cash adjustment and would not affect the company s liquidity 
business segment information the company has five reportable segments based primarily on the nature of the company s customers and products zip  cd rw  jaz  pocketzip and other jaz  pocketzip and some of the other products have been discontinued  see below for more information 
the zip segment involves the development  distribution and sales of personal storage products and applications  including zip disk and drive systems to retailers  distributors  resellers and oems throughout the world 
until the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary which closed in november  the company also manufactured its zip drives 
the company s cd rw segment involves the distribution and sales of cd rw drives to retailers  distributors and resellers throughout the world 
the cd rw segment also includes hotburn software which is bundled with cd rw drives and sold on a stand alone basis on the company s website 
the jaz segment involved the development  manufacture  distribution and sales of professional storage products and applications  including jaz disk and drive systems to resellers  distributors and retailers throughout the world 
the pocketzip segment involved the development  manufacture  distribution and sales of pocketzip drives and disks for use with portable digital products such as digital cameras  audio players  handheld personal computers and notebook computers to retailers  distributors and resellers throughout the world 
the other segment includes peerless drive systems  fotoshow  sourced products such as portable and desktop hdd drives  which began shipping during the second quarter of  nas servers  iomega mini usb drives  which began shipping during the fourth quarter of  iomega microdrive miniature hard drives  iomega compactflash and iomega smartmedia memory cards  iomega software products such as iomega automatic backup software and other miscellaneous items 
during  the company discontinued the jaz drive and pocketzip product line  including hipzip  which was being reported in the pocketzip segment 
under the other category  the company discontinued fotoshow  microdrive  compactflash and smartmedia 
the company currently sells disks for jaz and pocketzip products to support the installed drive base of these products 
during  the company recorded impairment charges of million as cost of sales  of which was charged to the zip segment and million was charged to the jaz segment 
these impairment charges resulted from the company entering into an agreement to sell the penang manufacturing subsidiary see the section below entitled penang manufacturing subsidiary impairment charges for more detail 
during  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million  of which million was charged to the respective product lines mainly as cost of sales 
these charges primarily reflected write downs of hipzip  fotoshow  cd rw and other inventory  equipment and other assets  loss accruals for related supplier purchase commitments and other various contractual arrangements 
during  the company recorded restructuring charges of million associated with the cd rw segment 
during  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million as cost of sales  primarily reflecting write downs of pocketzip inventory and equipment and loss accruals for related supplier purchase commitments 
during  reversals of restructuring charges originally recorded in that were associated with the jaz and pocketzip segments totaled million see the sections below entitled non restructuring charges and restructuring charges reversals for more detail 
the company evaluates performance based on ppm for each segment 
ppm is defined as sales and other income directly related to a segment s operations  less both fixed and variable product costs  research and development expenses  selling expenses and amortization directly related to a segment s operations 
when such costs and expenses exceed sales and other income  ppm is referred to as product loss 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements operations and significant accounting policies 
intersegment sales  eliminated in consolidation  are not material 
the expenses attributable to general corporate activity are not allocated to the product segments 
the information in the following table was derived directly from the segments internal financial information used for corporate management purposes 
the information for has been reclassified to show the effects of eitf which requires  retroactively  certain consumer and trade sales promotion expenses to be shown as a reduction of sales 
the amount of this reclassification resulted in a reduction to sales and a corresponding decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for  comprised of million for zip  million for cd rw  million for jaz and million for other products 
the company did not have the necessary information to reflect an eitf reclassification in the eitf reclassification did not impact ppm

the company s zip products are targeted primarily to the retail consumer  personal computer oems and business industries including government  education  health care  business services and manufacturing 
the company s cd rw products are targeted primarily to the retail consumer and enterprise markets 
the company s hdd products are targeted primarily to the retail consumer and enterprise markets 
the company s iomega mini usb drives are targeted primarily to the retail consumer market 
the company s nas products are targeted primarily to the small to medium size business market and sold through vars  catalogs and distributors 
the largest markets for the company s zip products which accounted for of the company s sales in are education and government 
typically zip sales for the education market are strongest during the third and fourth quarters and zip sales are strongest for the government market during the fourth quarter 
the company s retail business is also strongest during the fourth quarter 
there can be no assurance that this historic pattern will continue and moreover this pattern could be affected by the significant weakness and uncertainty that currently exists in the united states and global economies and consumer confidence levels 
accordingly  sales for any prior quarter are not necessarily indicative of the sales to be expected in any future quarter 
eitf reclassifications sales and selling  general and administrative expense information for have been reclassified to show the effects of eitf which requires  retroactively  certain consumer and trade sales promotion expenses to be shown as a reduction of sales

penang manufacturing subsidiary impairment charges  non restructuring charges and restructuring charges reversals discussions the following discussion of the company s penang manufacturing subsidiary impairment charges  non restructuring and restructuring charges are also found in their entirety in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
penang manufacturing subsidiary impairment charges on november   the company completed the sale of all of the stock of its wholly owned indirect subsidiary  iomega malaysia sdn 
bhd 
the penang manufacturing subsidiary  to venture pursuant to an agreement entered into by the parties on september  the agreement 
the principal assets of the penang manufacturing subsidiary were manufacturing equipment  inventory and a  square foot manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia where the company s zip drives and certain other products are manufactured 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  at the closing of the transaction  the company received total proceeds of million for the penang manufacturing subsidiary  which amount was determined by an arms length negotiation between the parties and was based on the net asset value of the penang manufacturing subsidiary on november  included in the assets sold by the company was million of cash in operating accounts  so the company received net cash proceeds of million 
venture has completed its post closing balance sheet audit and there were no material adjustments 
venture has in the past provided contract manufacturing services to the company for printed circuit board assemblies 
on november   the company entered into a five year manufacturing services agreement with venture and the company s former penang manufacturing subsidiary for the manufacture and supply of zip drives and certain other storage related products 
as a result of the agreement entered into during the third quarter of  the company determined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  that the net assets owned by the penang manufacturing subsidiary were impaired  as the sales price was below the carrying value of the net assets on the penang manufacturing subsidiary s books 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded impairment charges of million  reported in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and reflected in the table below for the impairment of the penang manufacturing subsidiary s net assets to their fair value as determined by the sales price 
of the million in impairment charges  million was attributable to the zip product line and million was attributable to the jaz product line 
the majority of the fixed assets and inventory were attributable to the zip product line 
in addition to the million of impairment charges  as a result of this divestiture  the company also recorded a us tax liability of million relating to past foreign earnings that will no longer be considered to be permanently invested abroad 
this additional tax liability was partially offset by a reduction in the company s tax valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the net tax provision of million 
the company does not expect that it will be liable  as a result of the tax provision  to make cash payments for us taxes unless the company were to later repatriate these foreign earnings to the united states 
the major groups of assets and liabilities of the penang manufacturing subsidiary which were sold on november   and the corresponding balances contained in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were as follows november  december  in thousands assets current assets cash   restricted cash inventories   other current assets total current assets   net property  plant and equipment total assets   liabilities current liabilities accounts payable   other current liabilities   total current liabilities   non restructuring charges during  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million  mainly as cost of sales

inventory reserves recorded in the second quarter of amounted to million 
loss accruals for related supplier purchase commitments amounted to million 
additional accruals of million were recorded to reflect valuation reserves for inventory in the channel 
also included in the second quarter non restructuring charge was million reflecting the extent to which undiscounted future cash flows were estimated to be less than the net book value of related manufacturing equipment 
the company began shipping a usb zip mb drive in the fourth quarter of this product was scheduled for replacement by two new lower cost drives in the third quarter of as a result of sales of the usb zip mb drive not meeting prior company forecasts  which caused the company to change future expectations and the transition to the new lower cost drives  the company recorded inventory reserves of million  loss accruals of million for supplier purchase commitments and write downs of related manufacturing equipment amounting to million 
the company began shipping cd rw products in august most of the company s cd rw drives are purchased from suppliers and marketed under the iomega name without significant manufacturing activity by the company 
due to intense competitive pricing pressures in the cd rw market  prices fell faster for cd rw products than the company anticipated  particularly during the second quarter of the company was unable to negotiate lower prices with vendors at the same rate as external prices to its customers declined 
as a result  the company recorded inventory reserves of million  loss accruals of million for supplier purchase commitments  million of reserves for channel inventory exposures and write downs of related manufacturing equipment amounting to million 
the company began shipping the hipzip digital audio player late in the third quarter of sales volumes during the first half of did not meet the company s expectations  which caused the company to change future expectations 
the digital audio player market became saturated with competitive product offerings 
as a result  during the second quarter of  the company recorded inventory reserves of million  loss accruals of million for supplier purchase commitments and write downs of related manufacturing equipment amounting to million 
the company began shipping the fotoshow digital viewer in the third quarter of the target market for this product was digital camera users 
the company was unsuccessful in its efforts to market this product to these users through both existing and new channels 
as a result  sales have not met the company s prior expectations  which caused the company to change future expectations 
as a result  the company recorded inventory reserves of million  loss accruals of million for supplier purchase commitments and write downs of related manufacturing equipment amounting to million 
charges recorded for other products were primarily for sourced products such as microdrive  magneto optical drives in europe  and compactflash and smartmedia products which the company began selling in the first quarter of as a result of sales not meeting prior expectations  which caused the company to change future expectations  the company recorded inventory reserves of million and reserves of million for channel inventory exposures 
the company also wrote down other excess miscellaneous manufacturing equipment amounting to million 
during the second quarter of  an accrual of million was recorded reflecting the separation agreement with mr 
bruce albertson  the company s former president and chief executive officer 
third quarter during the third quarter of  the company recorded non restructuring charges of million  primarily reflecting write downs of cd rw  hipzip  peerless and fotoshow inventory and equipment and other assets and charges associated with various contractual arrangements and supplier commitments 
inventory reserves recorded in the third quarter of totaled million 
contract cancellation costs totaled million 
the non restructuring charges also included million primarily reflecting the extent to which undiscounted future cash flows were expected to be less than the net book value of related manufacturing equipment and other assets as well as million for costs associated with moving the corporate headquarters from roy  utah to san diego  california 
during the third quarter of  due to decreasing sales volumes  the company entered into a settlement agreement to terminate a third party manufacturer of zip disk products and consolidate this production into the company s manufacturing facility in penang  malaysia 
as a result  during the third quarter of  the company recorded contract cancellation costs of million 
in addition  due to declining volumes  the company recorded write downs of related manufacturing equipment and miscellaneous supplier commitments amounting to million

in addition  if the company adds incremental non zip product sales  such products will likely have lower gross margin percentages 
future gross margin percentages will depend on a number of factors including pricing actions or promotions  including those designed to increase demand for zip products  the mix between zip products compared to sourced products such as cd rw  hdd and nas  sales mix between aftermarket and oem or private label channels  as oem and private label sales generally provide lower gross margins than sales through other channels  sales mix of zip mb  zip mb and zip mb drives and disks  as sales of the various zip products have differing gross margins  sales volumes of zip disks  which generate significantly higher gross margin percentages than the corresponding drives  the strength or weakness of foreign currencies  especially the euro  the impact of any future material cost reductions  supply or other disruptions  the ability to avoid future inventory and fixed asset charges  the ability to accurately forecast future product demand  the ability to cover fixed costs associated with newly introduced products  potential start up costs associated with the introduction of new products  price competition from other substitute third party storage products including cd rw products  significant price competition given that cd r and cd rw discs are significantly cheaper than zip disks  possible payment of license royalties to resolve alleged patent infringement disputes and general economic conditions

the us federal nols expire at various dates beginning in and the us state nols expire at various dates beginning in the company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets related to foreign nols  which reflect a tax benefit of approximately million in future foreign tax deductions 
these carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in these deferred tax assets remain fully reserved because their realization is dependent on earning future foreign taxable income in the tax jurisdictions to which the nols related 
the largest of these foreign nols relates to the company s french subsidiary  nomai sa this subsidiary s operations have been shut down and therefore  the foreign nols related to nomai sa are not likely to be realized in the future

at december   million of total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in the us  compared to million at december  at december   the remaining million of total cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments were on deposit in foreign countries primarily western europe  compared to million at december  cash dividends of foreign earnings such as the repatriation of any of the million of foreign cash to the us would be considered taxable in the us for federal and state tax purposes at a rate of approximately 
however  the amount of cash ultimately required for us federal and state taxes would be less than the approximate rate due to the company s existing nol s and other tax credit carryforwards 
also  any taxes paid on the repatriation of cash to the us would not impact the statement of operations as taxes have already been provided on these foreign earnings 
working capital of million at december  increased by million  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from higher cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and lower accrued marketing  accrued restructuring charges  accrued purchase commitments  other accrued liabilities and accounts payable partially offset by lower trade receivables  inventories  current deferred income taxes and income taxes receivable 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities amounted to million  an improvement of million compared to cash used for operating activities of million for the year ended december  the higher cash provided from operating activities resulted primarily from improved operating results partially offset by changes in current assets and current liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable decreased for the year ended december  primarily from lower sales and improved collections 
days sales outstanding dso in receivables improved to days at december   compared to days at december  the company believes that it will be difficult to maintain dso in receivables at this level 
accounts payable decreased primarily from lower levels of purchasing resulting from lower sales volumes  lower inventories  cost reductions and the sale of accounts payable associated with the penang manufacturing subsidiary partially offset by approximately million in delayed payments on the initial purchases of inventory from the company s former penang manufacturing subsidiary that were not due as of december  other current liabilities decreased primarily from lower marketing accruals  purchase commitments and litigation accruals 
accrued restructuring charges decreased due to the utilization and reversal of reserves see section above entitled restructuring charges reversals for more detail about the activity 
inventory decreased primarily due to lower levels of peerless and zip inventories and a concentrated effort to improve inventory turnover 
income taxes receivable decreased primarily from the receipt of tax refunds 
during  the company made approximately million in cash payments related to the and restructuring actions and made approximately million in cash payments related to the second and third quarter non restructuring actions 
during  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million 
during  the company repurchased  shares of the company s common stock for million 
as of december   approximately million remained available for future repurchases under the stock repurchase plan authorized by the company s board of directors on september  any repurchase of shares is expected to be funded using the company s available working capital 
during the fourth quarter of  the company replaced an expiring letter of credit and classified million of cash as restricted cash to secure this new letter of credit 
per the agreement associated with this letter of credit  this cash will be set aside in a certificate of deposit until after the letter of credit expires in march the company also has million of restricted cash to cover foreign bank guarantees for value added taxes 
this cash is reported separately as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the company had a restricted cash balance of million 
this restricted cash resulted from the class action lawsuit  rinaldi  et al 
v 
iomega corporation  which as part of the court approved settlement  the company agreed to an award of million for plaintiffs attorneys fees 
accordingly  the company funded million into an escrow account 
during june  this escrow account was paid to the plaintiffs attorneys 
the company believes that its balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments  together with cash flows from future operations  will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  previously announced stock repurchase program and cash required for restructuring and other activities during the next twelve months 
however  cash flow from future operations  investing activities and the precise amount and timing of the company s future financing needs  cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the market demand for the company s products  the company s ability to stop its sales decline  competitive price pressures  worldwide economic conditions  the availability of critical components  the adequate supply of products from the company s sourcing partners  the progress of the company s product development efforts  the financial stability of the company s customers  the necessity for future restructuring or other charges which might consume cash and the success of the company in managing its inventory  forecasting accuracy  trade receivables and accounts payable 
should the company be unable to meet its cash needs from its current balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments and future cash flows from operations  the company would most likely seek financing from other sources or incur additional restructuring charges to adjust the company s expenditures to a level that its cash flows could support 
the company s current balance of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments is its primary source of liquidity 
the company currently does not have a credit facility in place and given the status of current capital markets and the company s recent history of sales declines  there is no assurance that  if needed  the company would be able to obtain financing from external sources 
contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of december  were as follows payments due by period obligation total less than year to years to years after years in thousands operating leases     restructuring commitments    purchase commitments   licensing agreements     total     the company conducts a substantial portion of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment used in its operations 
aggregate lease commitments under non cancelable operating leases are shown in the table above 
the company purchases the majority of its components on purchase orders 
these purchase orders generally extend one to three quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component 
the quantities on the purchase orders are based on estimated future sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it can be difficult to estimate future demand  which could result in purchase commitments 
the company s purchases commitments are shown above 
the company has entered into a licensing agreement whereby the company will make annual payments of million each january with the final payment occurring in january for use of another company s patents for research and development projects 
other matters sec review as previously disclosed in the company s annual report on form k for the years ended december  and december  and form q s throughout  in connection with a review of the company s periodic sec reports  the company has received comments from the staff of the sec requesting various supplemental information and certain additional disclosures 
the staff also has questioned aspects of the company s accounting for its acquisition of nomai  the subsequent evaluation of impairment of goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring charges recorded by the company in in particular  the staff has questioned whether a in connection with the nomai acquisition  approximately million of the acquisition cost should have been recorded as post acquisition expenses  rather than as goodwill  b any remaining unamortized goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition should have been written off in the third quarter of when the company decided to cease manufacturing at the nomai facilities in avranches  france the amount of unamortized goodwill reported by the company at the end of the third quarter of was million  and c the company had in place a sufficiently detailed plan to support the restructuring charges which amounted to million and million in the second quarter and second half of  respectively 
the company s management believes that the company s accounting for each of these matters  which is described in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail in its position 
if the company does not prevail  the company may be required to restate its consolidated financial statements in order to adjust the manner in which it has accounted for the nomai acquisition in  the subsequent evaluation in of the impairment of the goodwill relating to the nomai acquisition and the restructuring actions 
the company does not believe that any such restatement would have a material adverse effect on the company s current financial condition or future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in august of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company plans on adopting sfas beginning on january  the company believes that sfas will not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in july of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf sfas requires  in general  that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in sfas is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early adoption encouraged 
however  restructuring activities that were initiated under the guidance provided by eitf will continue to follow that guidance until the restructuring activity is completed 
the company plans on adopting sfas beginning on january  the company is unable to determine the effect of sfas on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity as the impact would be determined by the nature of any future restructuring actions 
in november of  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
this issue addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements whereby a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities 
this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the related revenue should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal periods beginning after june  the company plans on adopting eitf on june  the company believes that the effect of eitf on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity will not be material as the company currently has few multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
in december of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and disclosure sfas 
sfas addresses additional disclosure rules concerning stock based compensation and three alternative methods for companies to choose from for those companies that have chosen to expense stock options under the fair value method prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as previously announced  effective january   the company will expense the cost of stock options that the company grants to employees 
the company has selected the prospective method  which is one of the three transition methods allowed by sfas  to transition to the fair value method of measuring stock based compensation expense 
under the prospective method  the company will begin expensing only those employee stock options that are granted or modified after january  it is difficult to estimate the impact that expensing stock options will have on the company s statement of operations as this expense is dependent upon variables that are difficult to predict  such as the number of options to be granted during a period  the price of the company s common stock at the time of grant  the stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate during the period and the expected average life of the option 
a slight change in any one of these variables can materially affect the amount of expense to be recorded 
however  based on current estimates  the company believes that the impact will be less than million for the company has adopted the additional disclosure rules as prescribed by sfas in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting future operating results demand for the company s products the company s future operating results will depend  in large part  on market demand for the company s products and upon the company s ability to efficiently and profitably manage its operations 
the company s ability to achieve and maintain a significant market demand and presence for its products and to operate profitably will depend on a number of factors  including the following market demand for digital storage products in general  price  performance  quality and other characteristics of the company s products and of competing and substitute products rumored  announced or introduced by other vendors  emergence of any competing solutions as industry standards  success of the company in meeting targeted availability dates for new and enhanced products  success of the company in establishing and maintaining oem arrangements and meeting oem quality  supply and other requirements  willingness of oems to promote computers and other products containing the company s drives  success of the company s efforts to provide and maintain customer service and satisfaction  public perception of the company and its products  including statements made by industry analysts or consumers and adverse publicity resulting from such statements or from litigation filed against the company  worldwide economic conditions  including overall market demand for personal computers and other products with which the company s products can be used  ability of the company to maintain profitable relationships with distributors  retailers and other resellers of the company s products  ability of the company to comply with applicable laws  regulations  ordinances and other legal requirements in the numerous countries in which it does business  ability of the company to successfully manage litigation  including enforcing its rights  protecting its interests and defending itself from claims made against it  and ability of the company to maintain an appropriate cost structure and to minimize unforeseen and extraordinary expenses 
the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to successfully manage  satisfy or influence any of these factors 
zip drives and disks since  sales of zip products have accounted for a significant majority of the company s sales and profits 
however  these sales have declined significantly over the past several years 
for example  during  zip sales decreased million or from the company s zip drive units decreased million from and zip disk units decreased million units from the level of future sales of zip drives to end user customers will depend in large part on the company s ability to minimize  to the extent possible  the rate of decline for zip technology 
in order to minimize the rate of decline  the company must a successfully maintain market demand for removable storage products in general  b effectively position the zip drives against competing products such as cd rw drives  c reduce costs in order to compete against other substitute technologies and d maintain effective relationships with distributors  retailers and other resellers 
there is no assurance that the company can accomplish these objectives 
the company s sales of its proprietary zip disks both in terms of unit volumes and in terms of sales dollars have been declining on a year over year basis in recent years 
the company is developing new products and is attempting to obtain rights to market additional products in an attempt to create additional sustainable revenue streams 
in the meantime  the company s profitability remains dependent on maximizing  to the extent possible  sales of zip disks  which generate significantly higher gross and product profit margins than the related drives or other company products 
if the company fails to minimize year over year declines in zip disk sales  the company s profitability and or results of operations would be adversely affected 
factors which could lead to accelerated rates of decline in zip disk sales include the following the prevalence of cd rw drives being built into new computers and the low cost of cd r and cd rw media  the company may not succeed in its strategy to maintain zip disk usage by existing zip drive customers  the sales mix and tie rate between zip disks and zip drives may fall below levels anticipated by the company  another party may succeed in producing or marketing disks that are compatible with the company s zip drive products without infringing the company s proprietary rights  price reductions or promotions on zip disks may fail to produce a commensurate increase in demand  thereby reducing anticipated sales  or disruptions in the supply of zip drives and disks in the manufacturing process  in the distribution process  in the company s relationships with key retailers  distributors or resellers or other factors that could result in product unavailability 
as the company s zip drive and disk sales have declined  it has become increasingly difficult for the company to maintain its presence and shelf space with its key resellers and retailers 
management anticipates continued challenges in this area throughout although the company attempts to offer competitive sales and marketing programs to induce channel partners to continue to purchase zip products and other offerings  there is no assurance that the company will be successful 
a private label customer is the company s largest single purchaser of zip disks 
the company earns a lower gross margin on private label disk sales because private label prices generally provide a functional discount to the private label customer  which in turn agrees to incur all of the sales  marketing and distribution expenses associated with reselling the disks under its brand name 
in appropriate cases  the company may also provide a volume discount to the private label customer 
if the percentage of zip disks sold to the private label customer materially increases  the company s overall gross margin from sales of zip disks could decline due to lower margins and lower prices generally associated with such sales 
a decrease in the amount of zip disks purchased by the private label customer would likely result in an overall decrease in zip disk sales 
the company sells a significant volume of zip drives to a relatively small number of computer oems 
the company s oem customers are not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of zip drives 
moreover  the fact that the number of oem customers is relatively small presents a risk that the loss of one or more key oem accounts would have an immediate  material  adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or operating results 
there is a growing trend among personal computer oem customers to adopt cd rw and dvd rw drives as standard product features 
this trend has had a material adverse impact on the company s zip business 
in order to maintain a profitable level of zip drive sales to oems  the company must successfully maintain market demand for zip drives and reduce the cost of zip drives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
the company s largest oem customer  dell computer  decided that it would not qualify the company s recently introduced zip mb internal drive 
rather  dell presently carries the external usb zip mb drive as an aftermarket peripheral device and may build also build the internal zip mb drive into personal computers on a special order basis 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully encourage dell to change its decision and agree to qualify the new zip mb internal drive 
notwithstanding the foregoing challenges and risks  the company s ability to minimize  to the extent possible  the decline in zip unit volumes and sales will be critical to the company s future profitability 
for example  during  the ppm for the zip business including impairment charges was million compared to a product loss of million on all other products 
despite all of the company s efforts to promote the zip business  it has continued to decline and the company has announced that zip revenue is expected to be lower in compared to although the decline is expected to continue  the company has been unable to accurately forecast and predict the actual rate of decline over time 
as a result  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its zip business and profitability 
cd rw drives the company s cd rw business strategy differs fundamentally from its zip product strategy 
material differences between the cd rw and zip businesses include the following a the company does not own any significant intellectual property relating to cd rw drives  b unlike zip drives  the cd rw drives use very low cost  non proprietary discs available from many sources  c there is intense competition between different providers of cd rw drives  and d the company obtains significantly lower overall gross margins on sales of cd rw drives than on zip drives 
the overall cd rw business is characterized by low gross margins  the frequent introduction of performance upgrades and intense competition from both brand name and generic  low cost competitors 
in light of these factors  the company must closely monitor its inventory levels  product transitions  sales channel inventory  purchase commitments  advertising and other marketing expenses in order to compete effectively and profitably 
there is no assurance that the company can achieve these objectives and historically it has failed to do so 
the company has reported product losses on its cd rw business every year since it entered the cd rw market in in spite of these challenges  the company believes it must maintain a presence in the cd rw market in order to achieve its overall objective to be viewed as a full line supplier of digital storage devices in its retail channels and the goal of creating destination storage in the retail environment 
the company s cd rw business activities are focused on reducing product costs and operating expenses  improving inventory management processes  more favorable contract terms  improving product life cycle management and revising channel marketing programs with the ultimate goal to minimize product losses 
however  there is no assurance that the company s activities in this regard will be successful 
the suppliers  as the original manufacturers  have certain competitive advantages over the company in the marketplace  including the ability at any time to sell substantially identical drives at lower prices than the company 
in addition  the company believes that the overall market for aftermarket external cd rw drives is shrinking  due to factors such as the following a oems continue to offer  and customers continue to choose  internal cd rw drives as a standard product feature  thereby minimizing market demand for external cd rw drives  b customers continue to transition from cd rw drives to dvd recordable drives  and c aftermarket internal drives are now significantly less expensive than external cd rw drives 
iomega hdd drives in  the company began shipping a series of portable and desktop hdd drives 
the company faces many of the same challenges in this market sector as it has in the cd rw market 
for example  a the company does not own any significant intellectual property relating to hdd drives  b there is intense competition between different providers of hdd drives  and c there is a need to continually requalify new drives as existing drives come into short supply or become obsolete 
the overall hdd market is characterized by low gross margins  the frequent introduction of upgraded products and intense competition from both brand name and generic  low cost competitors 
in order to successfully compete in this market  the company must meet aggressive product price and performance targets and create market demand for its particular brand of external hard disk drives 
there is no assurance that the company can or will be able to do so 
iomega nas products during  the company introduced nas devices with capacities ranging from gb to gb 
through this product line  the company is attempting to leverage the iomega brand name into the network infrastructure and storage market  as opposed to the personal computer desktop laptop storage market 
the nas market is dominated by large computer providers including dell  ibm and hewlett packard compaq  is highly price competitive  primarily relies upon vars and requires core competencies in server  software and networking technologies 
the company has little historic expertise in these areas and is developing a strategy to address these requirements and challenges 
the nas market is an emerging market and there is no assurance that the market will develop as anticipated 
in  the company incurred start up expenses relating to nas product qualification  launch and customer support in excess of its expectations 
as a result  the company has recorded a nas product loss in each quarter it has been shipping the product 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop the necessary core competencies to compete in this market segment  that the company s nas products will be successful  that the company will be successful in implementing its network storage systems strategy  or that the company will achieve profitability on this product line in or thereafter 
development and introduction of new products and new revenue streams during  and  the company invested significant resources in developing and launching new products  including peerless  pocketzip  hipzip  fotoshow and microdrive products 
the company was unable to sell any of these products profitably and has exited the market with each of these products 
in  the company introduced desktop and portable hdd drives and the iomega mini usb drives 
moreover  most of the company s current non zip storage products  including hdd drives  nas and cd rw  were unprofitable at the ppm level during notwithstanding these failures  the company believes that it must develop or acquire new product lines in order to remain viable 
in addition to nas products and new hdd products  as described above  the company expects to review new business opportunities in multiple areas including digital storage  software  disks  drives  networking  services and other related areas 
the company may spend significant resources a attempting to develop new technologies products  or applications  b attempting to acquire new technologies  products or applications or c attempting to market new products incorporating such products or applications 
the company has planned to focus its development efforts in on two new high capacity removable storage devices  including a small form factor removable flexible magnetic storage device that is expected to have a capacity of about gb and a removable hard disk storage system that is expected to have a capacity of approximately gb 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors 
moreover  introduction of new products entails risks relating to factors such as the following unforeseen manufacturing and technical challenges  performance  quality or other issues that are only discovered in the context of usage by large numbers of end users  lack of defensible intellectual property  lack of relevant core competencies or market expertise  intense competition from substitute technologies  lack of market acceptance  significant expenditures for tooling and inventory before any market demand is validated and risk that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against new products 
general economic conditions the company s future operating results are subject to risks associated with general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
an ongoing decrease in consumer spending would likely have a direct impact on the company s sales 
any disruption in general economic conditions including those caused by acts of war  terrorism or other factors could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
the company believes that economic conditions in the personal computer industry have deteriorated and this downturn has affected the computer resellers  distributors and retailers who sell the company s products 
although the company uses commercially reasonable steps to manage the credit granted to its customers  certain receivable balances from one or more of its customers may become uncollectible 
this event could adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company may be required to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts in the future 
company operations the company has experienced and may in the future experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly operating results 
moreover  because the company s expense levels including budgeted selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate adverse effect on the company s net income and cash flow 
inventory management management of the company s inventory levels is very complex 
the company s customers frequently adjust their ordering patterns in response to factors such as the following customer and market demand for the company s products and perceptions of the company s ability to meet demand  company s and competitors inventory supplies in the retail and distribution channel  new product introductions  seasonal fluctuations  company and customer promotions and consolidation of customer distribution centers 
customers may increase orders during times of shortages  cancel orders if the channel is filled with currently available products or delay orders in anticipation of new products 
excess inventories could force the company to reduce prices  write down such inventory or take other actions which in turn could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
product procurement the company recently sold its penang manufacturing subsidiary to a third party  venture 
the company has entered into a five year manufacturing services agreement with venture for the manufacture and supply of zip drives and certain other products 
there is no assurance that this transaction will allow the company to reduce costs or otherwise be beneficial to the company 
as a result of this transaction  the company faces new risks including the following company will no longer have direct control over the manufacturing processes of zip drives and other products  company s ability to quickly increase or decrease production rates may be impaired  company may face product shortages  company may incur continuing increased product or operational costs 
specifically  the product prices agreed to with venture are contingent upon the company purchasing certain volumes and the company has already incurred incremental costs as a result of not meeting the targeted volumes on zip drives and such increased costs will continue until the volume targets are achieved  company has incurred significant charges related to the sale of the facility and there is no assurance that the benefits of these transactions to the company will outweigh such charges  company faces new risks related to order management  supply and distribution issues  company s lack of control over its manufacturing process may increase the risk that quality or reliability problems may arise with respect to its products  possible turn over of knowledgeable personnel or loss of technical skill sets  transition of computer systems or information systems that impede communication or supply management  distribution risks in the asia pacific region and other risks associated with the fact that venture owns the only manufacturing facility producing zip drives and thus plays a key role in the company s supply and sale of zip drives  increasing the significance of any difficulties encountered at that facility 
product procurement costs the company believes that it must continue to reduce the procurement costs of its products 
however  with the sale of the penang manufacturing subsidiary  the company has limited involvement in the manufacturing of any of the products it sells 
thus  in order to reduce product costs  the company believes that it must successfully negotiate lower product procurement costs from suppliers  including venture and certain other key suppliers 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
distribution and logistics the company has outsourced its distribution and logistics centers and  consequently  has become more reliant upon the computer systems of its outsourcing partners 
the company faces risks that these systems may have communication  control or reliability problems 
in the outsourcing of its european and asia pacific distribution and logistics function  disparate computer systems between the company and its outsourcing partners necessitated the creation of manual processes in order to record certain transactions 
manual processes are more prone to error than automated processes and the company is working to reautomate these processes but this effort has not been completed 
a number of problems may occur in any distribution outsourcing relationship  including problems relating to product availability  supply  distribution  handling  shipping  quality or reliability 
such problems  if they were to arise with respect to the company s outsourced operations  could have an adverse effect in the form of a lower company sales  income and or gross margin  b damage to the company s reputation in the marketplace  resulting in decreased demand for or acceptance of the company s products or c damage claims filed against the company by customers  contract partners or investors as a result of such problems 
the company expects that it will evaluate and implement additional outsourcings of business functions in the future 
any such outsourcing initiatives may pose risks of delays and business disruption including risks similar to those discussed in the foregoing paragraphs entitled product procurement and distribution and logistics 
obsolescence risks the company s ability to effectively manage obsolescence risks will affect its operating results 
the company may terminate its marketing of certain products from time to time in response to market demand  supply  cost  competition or other factors 
this requires the company to carefully manage a number of issues  such as a maintaining market demand for the terminated product while successfully selling existing inventories through the channel  b reserving sufficient  but not excessive  quantities of product to comply with warranty  customer satisfaction and legal obligations  c preventing  to the extent possible  the return of such products from inventories held by distributors  retailers and other resellers and d other associated risks 
there is no assurance that the company can successfully manage these factors 
component supplies although the company has sold its penang manufacturing subsidiary  the company has retained responsibility for the supply of certain key components 
the company has experienced difficulty in the past and may experience difficulty in the future  in obtaining a sufficient supply of many key components on a timely and cost effective basis 
many components incorporated or used in the manufacture of the company s products are currently available only from single or sole source suppliers or from a limited number of suppliers and are purchased by the company without guaranteed supply arrangements 
in addition  the company has only one supplier of certain key products 
from time to time  suppliers of critical components announce their intention to discontinue manufacturing 
in such cases  the company attempts to make an end of life purchase on the required component s based on its estimates of all future requirements 
there is no assurance that an end of life purchase option will be available from a supplier who has chosen to discontinue a component 
moreover  there can be no assurance that the company s estimates of future requirements will be accurate or that the components purchased would not be subsequently lost  become defective or be otherwise damaged 
in summary  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of components on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s inability to obtain sufficient components and equipment or to obtain or develop alternative sources of supply could have a number of adverse consequences  such as the following the company might be unable to produce sufficient quantities of its products to satisfy market demand  in the case of a component purchased exclusively from one supplier  the company could be prevented from producing any quantity of the affected product s until such component becomes available from an alternative source  the company might be forced to delay product shipments  the company s material or manufacturing costs might increase  or the company could experience an imbalance in the inventory levels of certain components  which could increase costs  slow or stop production  or cause the company to modify the design of its products to use a more readily available component  with uncertain consequences 
any or all of these problems could in turn result in the loss of customers  provide an opportunity for competing products to achieve market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect the company s business and financial results 
the purchase orders under which the company buys many of its components and sourced products generally extend one to three quarters in the future based on the lead times associated with the specific component or sourced product 
the quantities on the purchase order are based on estimated sales requirements 
in the case of new products or products with declining sales  it is difficult to forecast product demand  which could result in either insufficient or excess products and or purchase commitments 
the company has recorded significant charges in the past relating to supplier purchase commitments and inventory reserves 
the company may be required to take similar charges attributable to forecasting inaccuracies in the future 
intellectual property risks patent  copyright  trademark or other intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against the company at any time 
such claims could have a number of adverse consequences  including an injunction against current or future product shipments  a requirement that the company pay royalties to a third party in order to continue to market and distribute one or more of the company s current or future products  a requirement that the company pay royalties to third parties for past product shipments  a requirement that the company devote unplanned resources to developing modifications to its products or marketing programs  a requirement that the company indemnify third parties who have distributed the infringing product with the company s permission or significant legal fees incurred by the company 
the company must routinely review and respond to claims from third parties for patent royalties  both on products designed or sold by the company and products designed and supplied to the company by third parties 
resolution of patent infringement demand letters and lawsuits can be very costly  with legal fees and costs running into the millions of dollars 
the company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a variety of means  including seeking and obtaining patents  trademarks and copyrights  and through license  nondisclosure and other agreements 
the company s failure to properly protect its intellectual property rights could have devastating consequences 
although the company has  in general  been successful in its efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
legal risks the company has entered into multiple agreements  including service  supply  resale  distribution  development and other agreements in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
in addition  as of december   the company employed people throughout the world 
although the company attempts to fulfill all of its obligations and enforce all of its rights under these agreements and relationships  there is no assurance that it will be able to do so 
the company has been sued and may be sued  under numerous legal theories  including breach of contract  tort  products liability  intellectual property infringement and other theories 
complaints have been filed and may be filed  against the company by contract partners  third parties  employees and other individuals or entities 
such litigation may have an adverse effect upon the company s profitability or public perception 
restructuring and other cost reduction activities the company recorded significant restructuring and other charges in in connection with restructuring and other actions intended to reduce the company s break even point  improve operating cash flow  streamline the company s supply chain and logistics strategy and otherwise improve company efficiency  profitability and viability 
additional restructuring actions may be necessary in the future 
there can be no assurance that any further restructuring activities will have their desired effects 
although the company has reduced operational expenses  there is no assurance that these reductions are sustainable 
management expects that prior restructuring and other actions will reduce future operational expenses 
however  management anticipates the need to implement additional operational cost reductions 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in this regard 
in carrying out these actions  the company is at risk that key personnel and experience may be lost 
the company may experience disruptions of information technology systems and other business operations or may lose institutional knowledge 
the company may incur legal liability and claims associated with the restructuring activities and layoffs 
any such disruption could adversely affect the company s financial results 
retention of key employees the company s success depends in large part upon the services of a number of key employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company

significant portions of the company s sales are generated in europe and asia 
the company s existing infrastructure outside of the united states is less mature and developed than in the united states 
consequently  future sales and operating income from these regions are less predictable than in the united states 
the company invoices the majority of its european customers in euros and invoices its remaining customers in us dollars 
fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar that are not sufficiently hedged by foreign customers invoiced in us dollars could result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on future operating results see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
doing business outside the united states can be difficult to manage or to properly execute 
american executives may overlook local trends outside the u 
s  market ineffectively in a foreign country  institute efforts from an american perspective that are unsuccessful outside the us or be unaware of customs or laws in other countries  with resulting legal exposure  complaints  cost inefficiencies or weak sales 
the company has substantial balances of cash  cash equivalents and temporary investments 
significant portions of these balances are invested in investment grade instruments and securities  including commercial paper and corporate bonds 
the company monitors these investments in accordance with the company s investment policies 
adverse events or developments in regard to a particular issuer could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position or operating results 
the company has issued stock options that are subject to variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation interpretation 
under variable plan accounting  the company is required to recognize compensation expense in its statement of operations for any increase in the market price of the company s common stock above the market price at july   which was the effective date of interpretation 
this compensation expense must be recorded on a quarterly basis until the option is exercised  forfeited or expires unexercised 
the impact of the new options granted under the exchange program on the company s financial statements will depend on quarterly fluctuations in the company s common stock price and the dates of exercises  forfeitures or cancellations of the new options by employees 
at december   there were approximately  options subject to variable plan accounting 
depending on these factors  the company could be required to record significant compensation expense during the life of the options  which expire in april moreover  because the precise amount of compensation expense will depend on the market price of the common stock at the end of each quarterly period  the company will not be able to forecast in advance the amount of compensation expense that it will incur in any future period 
effective january   the company will expense the cost of stock options that the company grants to employees 
the company will expense stock options under the prospective method  which is one of the three transition methods allowed by sfas under the prospective method  the company will begin expensing under the fair value method prescribed by sfas only stock options that are granted or modified after january  it is difficult to estimate the impact that expensing stock options will have on the company s statement of operations as this expense is dependent upon variables that are difficult to predict  such as the number of options to be granted during a period  the price of the company s common stock at the time of grant  the stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate during the period and the expected average life of the option 
a slight change in any one of these variables can materially affect the amount of expense to be recorded 
in summary  a number of factors could adversely affect the company or could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward looking statements 
such factors include the ability of management to manage an increasingly complex business in a highly competitive environment  transportation issues  product and component pricing  changes in analysts earnings estimates  competition  technological changes and advances  adoption of technology or communications standards affecting the company s products  intellectual property rights  litigation  general economic conditions  seasonality and changes or slowdowns in overall market demand for personal computer products and other consumer products which utilize the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various interest rate risks including foreign currency  interest rate and securities price risks 
the company is exposed to various foreign currency exchange rate risks that arise in the normal course of business 
the company s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company has international operations resulting in receipts and payments in currencies that differ from the functional currency of the company 
the company attempts to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to company policies 
the company uses forward contracts to hedge those net assets and liabilities that  when remeasured according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  impact the consolidated statement of operations 
all forward contracts entered into by the company are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
currently  the company is using forward contracts only to hedge balance sheet exposure 
the contracts are primarily in european currencies and the singapore dollar 
the company enters into contracts throughout the month as necessary 
these contracts normally have maturities that do not exceed a fiscal month 
when hedging balance sheet exposure  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income and expense in the same period that the gains and losses on remeasurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
iomega corporation and subsidiaries the fair value of the company s forward contracts is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market rates and prices 
if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken against these foreign currencies by  the hypothetical value of the contracts would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
however  these forward exchange contracts are hedges  consequently any market value gains or losses arising from these foreign exchange contracts should be offset by foreign exchange losses or gains on the underlying net assets and liabilities 
calculations of the above effects assume that each rate changed in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
the calculations reflect only those differences resulting from mechanically replacing one exchange rate with another 
they do not factor in any potential effects that changes in currency exchange rates may have on statement of operations translation  sales volume and prices and on local currency costs of production 
as of december  and december   the company s analysis indicated that such market movements  given the offsetting foreign currency gains or losses on the underlying net assets and liabilities  would not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging programs include volatility of the currency and interest rate markets  availability of hedging instruments and the company s ability to accurately project net asset or liability positions 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the company s analysis depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign exchange rate movements and the company s actual exposures and hedges 
the company did not have any significant debt outstanding at december  and december  should the company need to borrow funds in the future  it would be subject to credit based interest rate risks 
the company is also subject to interest rate risks on its current cash  cash equivalents and temporary investment balances 
for example  if the interest rate on the company s interest bearing investments were to change  interest income would have hypothetically increased or decreased by million during and million during this hypothetical analysis does not take into consideration the effects of the economic conditions that would give rise to such an interest rate change or the company s response to such hypothetical conditions 
the company minimizes its credit risk associated with temporary investments by using investment grade  highly liquid securities 
the company has classified all of its temporary investments as available for sale securities 
temporary investments at december  and primarily consisted of municipal notes  bonds and paper  government securities  commercial paper  asset backed securities  corporate notes and bonds and paper with a maximum maturity of months 
the company s temporary investments are purchased with maturities in excess of three months 
cash and cash equivalents include all marketable securities purchased with maturities of three or fewer months 
cash equivalents consisted primarily of investments in money market mutual funds  commercial paper  auction rate  money market preferred stock investments  taxable and non taxable municipal bonds and notes
