overview marketing and merchandising initiatives and operational improvements 
in fiscal and early fiscal  the company posted net losses  comparable sales and customer counts were flat to negative  and the company had no strategy for reversing the negative trends 
the company also was in default under its million credit facility and required additional capital to expand its store base 
in march of  perry odak was hired as our ceo and president  and throughout fiscal  the majority of the company s management was replaced with executives with extensive and successful backgrounds in retail sales  operations  merchandising  marketing and finance 
this new management team recognized that we had major operational issues to correct in order to reverse the then current negative trends  including but not limited to poorly integrated acquisitions underperforming real estate and no growth strategy weak infrastructure huge numbers of skus and vendors on file pricing inconsistencies across the store base lack of operational controls large percentage of out of stocks ineffective marketing and merchandising strategies in the third quarter of fiscal  we began to address these issues  with the testing of an aggressive new merchandising and marketing strategy that was rolled out in the fourth quarter of fiscal and throughout fiscal in fiscal  we focused on building operational controls  reducing our sku count through a sku rationalization program  implementing centralized buying and pricing  and creating a comprehensive and defensible real estate strategy 
we also entered into a new primary distribution agreement with tree of life  inc tol and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  switched to tol as primary distributor for all us stores 
in september of  we completed an equity offering that resulted in net proceeds of million for use in expansion plans 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented centralized scale hosting to bring consistency and control to the pricing of our perishable products 
we also began executing on our real estate strategy  and to the date of this report have signed leases or letters of intent for new sites opening in fiscal and fiscal  including eleven wild oats locations selected for the excellence of the projects  the position in new segments of existing markets and their defensibility from competitive attack  and seven henry s marketplace locations in easily accessible and highly visible locations in densely populated metropolitan los angeles 
throughout fiscal  we continued to focus on improving the customer experience through new product demonstration programs  staff training on customer service and product knowledge  and resetting and remerchandising a significant number of our older stores 
the shift to centralized buying and pricing refocused store staff energies on customer service 
we believe all these programs contributed to overall operational improvements that increased store sales  customer count and average transaction size in fiscal the sheer magnitude of the changes we implemented in fiscal  coupled with disruptions in product supply caused by our sku rationalization program and primary distributor switch  and a continued slow economy  contributed to declines in customer counts and comparable store sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal  although per customer basket size increased in the fourth quarter 
road construction adjacent to a number of our stores also contributed  in part  to a basis point decline in comparable store sales 
store format 
we operate two store formats the natural foods supermarket and farmers market formats 
the natural foods supermarket format store  operated under the wild oats r natural marketplace and nature s r a wild oats market tradenames  is generally  to  gross square feet  and the farmers market store  operated under the henry s marketplace r and sun harvest tm tradenames  is generally  to  gross square feet 
our profitability has been and will continue to be affected by the mix of natural foods supermarkets and farmers market stores opened  acquired or relocated and whether stores are being opened in markets where we have an existing presence 
in fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we redesigned the natural foods supermarket format store layout and design 
in april  we opened the first of our redesigned natural foods supermarket format stores in long beach  california  with subsequent new store openings using the prototype design in portland  maine and louisville  kentucky in the first quarter of fiscal we have also redesigned the prototype for our farmers market store format  and opened our first prototype store in costa mesa  california in the first quarter of fiscal we also plan to expand the farmers market store format as our second  parallel store format 
we believe this format  which is primarily located in metropolitan san diego  california and texas  appeals to a more value conscious customer 
this format has historically produced higher comparable store sales results than the natural foods supermarket format stores  although margins are lower 
the format also appears to perform better in the face of new competition  whether from conventional or natural foods supermarket competitors 
we currently have seven signed letters of intent or leases for farmers market format stores slated to open in fiscal and fiscal comparable store sales results 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the thirteenth full month of operations for new  relocated and acquired stores 
a variety of factors affect our comparable store sales results  including  among others general economic conditions the opening of stores by us or by our competitors in markets where we have existing stores the relative proportion of new or relocated stores to mature stores the timing of advertising and promotional events store remodels store closures our ability to effectively execute our operating plans changes in consumer preferences for natural foods products availability of produce and other seasonal merchandise 
past increases in comparable store sales may not be indicative of future performance 
the farmers market format stores  which depend heavily on produce sales  are more susceptible to sales fluctuations resulting from the availability and pricing of certain produce items 
road construction adjacent to our operating stores  as well as construction within the common areas of the shopping centers in which we operate  may also affect customer traffic and comparable store sales results 
as a result of marketing and merchandising initiatives  operational improvements  and the closure of nine weaker stores  comparable store sales chain wide increased by in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal due to the disruptions already mentioned  however  comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal declined to  as compared to in the third quarter of fiscal  in the second quarter of fiscal  in the first quarter of fiscal  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the third quarter of fiscal  in the second quarter of fiscal  and in the first quarter of fiscal there can be no assurance that comparable store sales for any particular period will not decrease in the future 
store openings  closings  sales  remodels  relocations and acquisitions 
in fiscal  we opened one new store in long beach  california 
we closed three natural foods supermarket stores in boca raton  florida  chesterfield  missouri  and cleveland  ohio  one farmers market store in serra mesa  california when the lease expired  as well as one small vitamin store in el paso  texas 
during fiscal  we sold natural foods supermarket stores in berkeley and sunnyvale  california two stores in related transactions  and victoria  british columbia  canada  as well as one small vitamin store in el paso  texas 
at december   we had stores located in states and canada  as compared to stores in states and canada as of the end of fiscal  and stores in states and canada as of the end of fiscal a summary of store openings  acquisitions  closures and sales is as follows total store count fiscal year ending period ending march  store count at beginning of period stores opened stores closed stores sold store count at end of period we currently have an inventory of vacant sites comprising closed store and office locations and excess unoccupied space acquired during acquisitions or other leasing transactions  for which we have rent obligations  appropriate accruals have been made for such obligations 
in fiscal  we sublet  assigned or negotiated the termination of excess properties from an inventory of vacant sites  the lease for one site on the inventory list expired and we added two former store sites  closed in fiscal  to our inventory 
we are actively seeking subtenants or assignees for the spaces  although many of the sites are difficult to sublease or assign because of unusual site characteristics  surpluses of vacant retail space in the markets in which the sites are located  or because the remaining lease terms are relatively short 
in september  we concluded an offering of million shares of our common stock for total gross proceeds of million 
in february of  we completed a refinancing of million under our existing credit facility with a group of banks led by the lead bank in our former credit facility 
the proceeds from the equity offering and the funds available under the credit facility will be used to finance proposed growth of ten to new stores in fiscal  to stores in fiscal and to stores in fiscal see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as has been our practice in the past  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition  and sales growth potential of all of our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  disposals  relocations or remodels in accordance with such evaluations 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses include labor  rent  advertising  utilities  supplies and certain other costs incurred prior to a store s opening 
the amount per store may vary depending on whether the store is the first to be opened in a market or is part of a cluster of stores in that market 
we expect our pre opening expenses will increase to  to  per natural foods supermarket store  and  to  per farmers market store  depending on whether the store is the first in a geographic area  the date of rent commencement negotiated under the lease  and the extent of grand opening advertising and staff training activities 
restructuring and asset impairment activity 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management made certain decisions relating to our operations that changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges and resulted in net restructuring and asset impairment income of  during the third quarter of fiscal  management made certain decisions relating to our operations that changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges and resulted in net restructuring and asset impairment income of  during the second quarter of fiscal  management made certain decisions relating to our operations that changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges and resulted in net restructuring and asset impairment expense of during the first quarter of fiscal  management made certain decisions relating to our operations that also changed estimates of prior restructuring and asset impairment charges and resulted in restructuring and asset impairment income of  see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates  including those related to goodwill valuation asset impairment charges restructuring charges and store closing costs allowance for bad debt inventory valuation and reserves self insurance reserves reserves for contingencies and litigation we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective december   the company implemented sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
was issued in july  supersedes accounting principles bulletin no 
 intangible assets  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  requires testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment and more frequently if the occurrence of an event or circumstance indicates an impairment  requires that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill and removes the year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
we monitor the carrying value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for potential impairment at the store level 
goodwill  previously recognized at the store level  is now recorded at the enterprise level and monitored accordingly 
the company anticipates an annual decrease in amortization of goodwill of approximately million and a corresponding annual increase to net income of million 
the company will test goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if the occurrence of an event or circumstance indicates potential impairment 
the triggering events for such evaluations include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  acquisition and construction costs in excess of budget  or current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note organization and summary of significant accounting policies  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company records an asset impairment charge when an impairment is identified 
future adverse changes in asset market values or store operating results could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets  thereby requiring an asset impairment charge in the future 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges  for an additional discussion of our policies regarding the calculation of asset impairments 
the company plans to complete store closures or sales within a one year period following the commitment date 
costs related to store closures and sales are reflected in the income statement as restructuring and asset impairment charges 
for stores the company intends to sell  the company actively markets the stores to potential buyers 
stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
for stores the company intends to close  a lease related liability is recorded for the present value of the estimated remaining noncancelable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income  or for estimated lease settlement costs 
in addition  the company records a liability for costs to be incurred after the store closing which are required under leases or local ordinances for site preservation during the period before lease termination 
the value of equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect recoverable values based on the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
severance costs incurred in connection with store closings are recorded when the employees have been identified and notified of the termination benefits to be made to the employees 
lease related liabilities and the recoverability of assets to be disposed of are reviewed quarterly  and changes in previous estimates are reflected in operations 
significant cash payments associated with closed stores relate to ongoing payments of rent  common area maintenance  insurance charges  and real property taxes as required under continuing lease obligations 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued on july  sfas no 
will require companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they occur rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for the company on january  and management believes it will have no material effect on the company s historical financial results 
the company maintains allowances for bad debt for estimated losses resulting from the inability of third parties to make required payments or ship product upon which credits are due 
if the financial condition of such third parties were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or provide credits  additional allowances may be required 
the company maintains allowances for excess or unsaleable inventory as a percentage of its gross inventory balance based on historical experience and assumptions about market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the company expands its forward buying of inventory  which will increase its inventory levels  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation claims and employee medical and dental benefits 
the company has purchased stop loss coverage to limit its exposure to any significant levels of claims 
self insured losses are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate insured claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the company s historical experiences 
if the company experiences an increase in claims  if actuarial assumptions are inaccurate  or if insurance industry costs increase beyond current expectations  then additional reserves may be required 
the company maintains reserves for contingencies and litigation based on management s best estimates of potential liability in the event of a judgment against the company  and possible settlement costs  as well as existing facts and circumstances 
future adverse changes related to current contingencies and litigation could necessitate additional reserves in the future 
during the second quarter ended june   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  rescinds sfas no 
 which required that gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects 
sfas no 
is to be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  and encourages early application of the rescission of sfas no 
during the twelve months ended december   and december   there were no gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the refinancing of our credit facility  the company will incur a non cash charge to write off the remaining unamortized debt issuance cost in the first quarter of fiscal of approximately factors impacting results of operations our results of operations have been and will continue to be affected by  among other things the number  timing and mix of store openings  acquisitions  relocations  remodels or closings fluctuations in quarterly results of operations impact of merchandising and marketing initiatives on store performance economic conditions construction adjacent to operating stores competition labor issues loss of key management government regulations changes in and performance by suppliers  distributors and manufacturers unavailability of product aggregate results of a store fixture and equipment inventory project volatility in our stock price new stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection gradually and  as a result  generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than more mature stores 
we anticipate that the new stores opened in fiscal years and will experience operating losses for the first six to months of operation  in accordance with historical trends  however  given the continued weakening of the us economy  operating losses may be extended for additional periods of time 
we substantially completed the remodeling of five of our older stores in fiscal  and remerchandised a number of our stores in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  with the goal of eliminating slower selling products  reducing excess sku counts in certain categories of products  and giving greater emphasis to produce  meat and seafood and grocery departments 
we plan to remodel an additional stores in fiscal remodels and remerchandising typically cause short term disruption in sales volume and related increases in certain expenses as a percentage of sales  such as payroll 
we cannot predict whether sales disruptions and the related impact on earnings may be greater in time or volume than projected in future remodeled or remerchandised stores 
the construction or acquisition of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  as well as completion of capital purchases of new technology systems required for efficient operation of our business require substantial capital expenditures 
in the past  cash generated from operations  bank debt and equity financing proceeds has funded our capital expenditures 
these sources of capital may not be available to us in the future 
in addition  our new credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to make capital expenditures that may constrain future growth without additional equity financing 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our quarterly results of operations may differ materially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons  including the timing and success of new store openings  overall store performance  changes in the economy  seasonality and the timing of holidays  significant increases or decreases in prices for or availability of goods and services  competitive pressure and labor disturbances  shrink and spoilage  fluctuations in profit margins for discontinued items  as well as other factors mentioned in this section 
we have implemented merchandising and marketing initiatives in certain of our natural foods supermarket format stores in fiscal there can be no assurances that these or any future programs will be successful in fiscal in those stores  nor that the cost of future program rollouts will be at or below the costs incurred in fiscal downturns in general economic conditions in communities  states  regions or the nation as a whole can affect our results of operations 
while purchases of food generally do not decrease in a slower economy  consumers may choose less expensive alternative sources for food purchases 
in addition  downturns in the economy make the disposition of excess properties  for which the company continues to pay rent and other carrying costs  substantially more difficult as the markets become saturated with vacant space and market rents decrease below our contractual rent obligations 
construction on roads and in parking lots and shopping center common areas adjacent to our operating stores is an ongoing and unpredictable variable in the operation of our stores 
such activity historically has negatively impacted our results of operations by reducing customer traffic and lowering sales volumes 
as mentioned previously  we compete with both natural foods and conventional grocers 
as competition in certain markets intensifies  our results of operations may be negatively impacted through loss of sales  reduction in margin from competitive price modifications  and disruptions in our employee base 
from time to time  unions will attempt to organize employees or portions of the employee base at stores or our distribution or manufacturing facilities 
responses to organization attempts require substantial management and employee time and are disruptive to operations 
in addition  from time to time certain of our stores may be subject to informational picketing  which can discourage customer traffic and lower sales volumes 
our ability to attract  hire and retain qualified employees at store and home office levels is critical to our continued success 
our future direction and success is dependent in large part on the continued services of certain key executive officers 
loss of any key officer may have an adverse affect on current operations and future growth programs 
we are subject to a myriad of local  state and federal regulations governing the operation of our stores and support facilities  including licensing laws governing the sale of particular categories of products  health and sanitation laws  laws governing the manufacture  labeling and importation of private label products  labor laws controlling wages  benefits and employment conditions of our employees and advertising regulations governing the manner in which we may advertise products we sell 
in october  the national organic standards  a comprehensive program of regulations governing the growing  production  handling and sale of goods labeled as organic  was fully implemented 
consumer and regulatory concerns regarding food safety issues  new technology or competitive pressures may trigger modifications in existing laws and the implementation of new laws governing components of our business operations 
such modifications can have a material impact on our sales volume  costs of goods and direct store expenses 
modification of such laws may also impact the vendors and manufacturers who provide goods and services to us  raising the cost of such items or decreasing their availability 
in addition  from time to time we are audited by various governmental agencies for compliance with existing laws  and we could be subject to fines or operational modifications as a result of noncompliance 
based upon our current distribution agreement  the company plans to purchase of our total goods from tol 
there is no assurance that we may not experience significant disruption in our operations through shortages of goods and services 
any significant disruption in the supply of goods could have a material impact on our overall sales volume and cost of goods 
inability of tree of life to fully fill orders by our stores may result in lower sales and loss of customers 
we received a transition fee as a part of our june distribution agreement with tol 
we are using the transition fee to offset the transition costs incurred during the transition of our primary distribution relationship to tol 
these costs include  but are not limited to  the cost of retagging store shelves  modification of product inventory  disposal of discontinued products  resetting of products on store shelves and training of store personnel in new procedures  and legal and consulting expenses 
a portion of the transition fee received was used to defray transition expenses incurred in the second  third and fourth quarters and had no material impact on the results of operations for the twelve months ended december  from time to time  we may experience product shortages due to the impact of adverse weather conditions  such as drought or flood  or disruptions in the supply chain from product shortages  transportation disruptions or other conditions 
product shortages may result in a material impact to our sales volume  cost of goods or customer counts 
we are currently completing an inventory of all fixtures and equipment in our stores 
if the results of such inventory are materially less than the assets currently shown on our balance sheet  such results may negatively impact the value of assets on our balance sheet as well as results of operations 
our stock price has been and continues to be fairly volatile 
our stock price is affected by our quarterly and year end results  results of our major competitors and suppliers  general market and economic conditions and publicity about our competitors  our vendors  our industry or us 
volatility in our stock price may affect our future ability to renegotiate our existing credit agreement or enter into a new borrowing relationship  or affect our ability to obtain new store sites on favorable economic terms 
results of operations our net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of sales fiscal year ended sales cost of goods sold and occupancy costs gross profit direct store expenses store contribution selling  general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges income income loss from operations loss on investment interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the opening of one new store in the second quarter of fiscal  operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal  as well as the rollout in the first half of fiscal of our new marketing and merchandising program in of our natural foods supermarket format stores 
comparable store sales increased for fiscal  as compared to an increase of for fiscal some of the comparable store sales increases are attributable to the continued strong performance of the farmers market format stores 
we expect sales to increase at a slightly faster rate in fiscal  due to the proposed opening of up to new stores  three of which were opened in the first quarter of fiscal  and the majority of which will open in the third quarter of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to more disciplined pricing strategies  a new category management structure  vendor consolidation and the completion of our sku rationalization program  which eliminated large numbers of slow moving items from our stores to make room for new  higher margin or faster moving items 
direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal direct store expenses decreased as a result of better expense management at store level  as well as the centralization of certain non retail contracts for items such as supplies  as well as maintenance  in store music  linens and other service contracts 
we anticipate that we will see increases in fiscal and beyond in the area of employee related insurance and general liability insurance costs 
on an absolute basis  we expect direct store expenses to increase with the addition of new stores  but on a percentage of sales basis to be consistent with fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increases are attributable to investments in information systems to support centralized purchasing and pricing  store level signage production and a new data warehouse  as well as increases in advertising and merchandising expenses related to the implementation of our marketing and merchandising program and expenses for expanded infrastructure at the company s headquarters to support new store growth and centralized purchasing and pricing 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal as part of the company s fiscal evolution of our marketing strategies  we expect to spend additional funds on marketing at the local and community level  as well as a slight increase in corporate and regional support staffs to support the opening of the new stores in the second half of fiscal as a result of these increased expenditures  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal over fiscal levels in both absolute and percentage terms 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses remained constant at for fiscal compared to fiscal as part of the company s increase in marketing efforts  we anticipate that pre opening expenses for new natural foods supermarket stores will increase from an estimated  historically to an estimated  per new store  and those of the farmers market format will increase from  historically to an estimated  in the future 
interest income 
interest income for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to  from million in fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower interest rates and reduced levels of invested cash 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to million from million in fiscal  due to higher average borrowings in fiscal and higher swap related interest rates on the term portion of the credit facility in fiscal under our second amended and restated credit facility  effective february  interest rates have decreased from libor plus the rate under our prior credit facility through february  to libor plus 
we expect interest expense to remain flat or decrease slightly as total borrowings increase throughout fiscal but at a substantially lower interest rate than paid in fiscal due to the current state of the us economy  management believes that the variable interest rates will remain constant during the next six to months

restructuring and asset impairment charges 
as part of the strategic repositioning announced in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we identified natural foods stores for closure or sale due to weak performance 
in fiscal  we closed and sold three of those identified stores 
in the second quarter of fiscal  as part of additional evaluation of the company s operations by new management  we identified an additional three stores for closure in fiscal  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we extended our evaluation and identified an additional three stores for closure in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  we identified six additional stores for closure or sale  for a total of stores identified for closure or sale in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal through the date of this report  we have closed of the identified stores  and sold nine stores  four in related transactions 
due to a change in estimates related to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to continue to operate four stores previously identified for closure or sale 
we have three remaining stores previously identified and remaining to be closed or sold 
a summary of restructuring activity by store count is as follows restructuring store count fiscal year ending period ending march  stores remaining at commencement of period stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale stores identified in fiscal for closure or sale identified stores closed or abandoned identified stores sold reversal of stores identified for closure or sale identified stores remaining at period end restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal and fiscal the following tables summarize the components of restructuring and asset impairment charges and income for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  by quarter in thousands fiscal components of charge st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total gain on sale of assets change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale lease related liabilities for stores identified to be closed or sold severance for employees fixed asset impairments total fiscal components of charge nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total fixed asset impairment change in estimate related to fixed asset impairment lease related liabilities for sites identified to be sold or closed change in estimates related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale severance for employees total the following details the significant components of restructuring and asset impairment charges and income for fiscal by quarter during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded restructuring and asset impairment income of  details of the significant components are as follows gain on sale of assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of asset disposal income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold a liquor license for a closed location in mission viejo  california for a higher price than originally estimated 
additionally  the company received an insurance settlement for a claim relating to the location in madison  new jersey  where the assets had previously been written off 
therefore  the company recognized asset disposal income of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale million of restructuring income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company negotiated the early termination of leases in west hollywood  california and san antonio  texas 
the company also secured viable subtenants for locations in vancouver  washington and boulder  colorado 
additional information received in fiscal resulted in a revision in the total rent allocated to one vacant location in albuquerque  new mexico  previously included within a restructuring charge  therefore  the company revised the estimate for future lease obligations 
based on these changes in facts and circumstances and the related changes in estimates  the company adjusted or reversed the remaining lease related liabilities previously recorded for these locations and therefore recognized restructuring income of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal lease related liabilities for three additional stores identified during the fourth quarter of fiscal to be closed or sold by the end of fiscal million of restructuring expense 
during the fourth quarter  the company decided to close or sell three additional locations due to lower than anticipated operational performance 
the lease related liabilities for these locations represent the company s estimate to dispose of these lease obligations based on current disposition efforts  and is attributable to deteriorating real estate markets in certain regions  existing lease obligations at above market rates  and unattractive site characteristics 
the charge for exit costs assumes  based on the company s current results of disposition efforts  that the company will be successful in disposing of these long term lease obligations within the next five years 
facts and circumstances can change in the future with respect to the above attributes affecting the ultimate resolution of these exit costs 
the company will make appropriate adjustments to the restructuring liabilities contemporaneous with the change in facts and circumstances 
severance for employees terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal  of restructuring expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  two employees were terminated with the sale of one vitamin expo location during the fourth quarter of fiscal the employees were notified of their involuntary termination during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december   all  of involuntary termination benefits had been paid to terminated employees

during the third quarter of fiscal  the company negotiated the early termination of a lease in tempe  arizona 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company also terminated lease obligations for a site in denver  colorado

during the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that certain fixed assets were not compatible with the company s new store design 
due to the implementation of the new store design  such assets could not be relocated as contemplated under the original restructuring plan 
as a result  the company determined it could not recover the previously estimated carrying value of these assets  and therefore recognized an asset impairment charge of approximately  during the second quarter of fiscal the assets were disposed in fiscal additionally  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it could partially recover the carrying value of certain fixed assets used in store front end operations that were previously written off  therefore  the company recognized asset disposal income of approximately  during the second quarter of fiscal change in estimate related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale  of restructuring income

see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges for details of the significant components of the charge 
restructuring accruals 
the material changes in the liability balances of each significant type of exit cost included in the restructuring charges in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal were related to changes in estimates for lease defeasance costs and for the net realizable value of fixed assets 
the changes in estimates during the second quarter of fiscal for lease defeasance costs in the restructuring charges during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal resulted from the economic downturn during fiscal  which has made it more difficult to find sublease tenants and settle lease terminations with landlords particularly in the case of leases with above market rents 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received updated estimates from various external sources ie  landlords and real estate brokers of the costs to exit certain lease obligations 
due to the economic downturn that worsened during the second quarter of fiscal  we revised our estimates of the costs associated with subleasing properties or settling lease terminations with landlords 
due to changes in facts and circumstances during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that four stores previously identified as sites held for disposal would continue to operate in their existing locations 
three of the stores were expected to be closed in conjunction with the company s opening of new stores in the respective trade areas  however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to abandon the new store sites and continue to operate the existing stores 
with regard to the fourth store  management decided in the fourth quarter of fiscal to continue to operate the store in its existing location after completing a competitive analysis of the market area and a reevaluation of the operations of the store in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which showed that the store was achieving acceptable performance levels and demonstrating positive performance trends following the implementation of our marketing program late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we reversed the restructuring accruals previously recorded for the long term lease obligations related to these four stores 
the material cash outlays associated with the company s exit plans are primarily for lease related obligations 
as of december   the components of the accruals related to the company s restructuring activities are accrued liabilities million and other long term obligations million 
as of december   million of involuntary termination benefits accrued during fiscal and fiscal had been paid to terminated employees 
income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended december  was as compared to for fiscal the increase primarily relates to limitations on the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits due to net operating losses 
the remainder of the change is attributable to an increase in state franchise taxes 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a million income tax benefit  primarily as a result of the loss before taxes of million during the period 
the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
although realization of the net deferred tax asset is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
our assessment is based on projections that assume that the company can maintain its current store contribution margin 
furthermore  we expect to maintain the sales growth experienced over the past five years that would generate additional taxable income 
the primary uncertainty related to the realization of the deferred tax asset is the company s ability to achieve its four year business plan and generate future taxable income to realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
we believe that the sales  gross margin  store contribution margin  and selling  general and administrative expenses assumptions in our four year business plan are reasonable and  more likely than not  attainable 
we will continue to assess the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset and to the extent it is determined in the future that a valuation allowance is required  it will be recognized as a charge to earnings at that time 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
sales for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the opening of four new stores in the first quarter of fiscal  as well as the inclusion of the stores opened or acquired in fiscal  offset by three stores closed or sold in fiscal and stores closed or sold in fiscal higher comparable store sales from existing stores contributed slightly more than half of the fiscal sales increase  with new stores contributing the balance 
comparable store sales increased for fiscal  as compared to a decrease for fiscal some of the comparable store sales increases are attributable to the phased roll out of a number of strategic initiatives as part of the our aggressive merchandising and marketing program  which are projected to increase overall sales gradually in those regions in which the initiatives are implemented  through increased advertising  more frequent advertised specials and modified pricing 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the smaller percentage increase in gross profit is due primarily to lower merchandise margins resulting from the implementation of pricing reductions as part of the merchandising and marketing program  as well as a shift in the sales mix between store formats 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal due primarily to lower merchandise margins resulting from the implementation of the merchandising and marketing program  as well as a shift in the sales mix between store formats  increases in inventory reserves for slow moving goods  lower margins on certain categories of products sold in the stores  higher utilities expenses and higher than expected coupon activity during the fourth quarter of fiscal direct store expenses 
direct store expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  direct store expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases are primarily due to increased payroll associated with an increase in the number of stores in operation  enhanced customer service efforts  additional benefit days due to a change in vacation policy in fiscal  increased health and dental  workers compensation  and general liability insurance costs related to general market conditions  and an increase in repairs and maintenance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal the increases are attributable to consulting and professional fees resulting from the comprehensive review of our business and strategic position million  severance costs for former senior executives million  recruiting and relocation costs  and expenses associated with the october amendment to our million credit facility  as well as increases in advertising and merchandising expenses related to the implementation of the marketing and merchandising initiatives program and expenses for expanded infrastructure at the company s headquarters to support the new advertising  merchandising and pricing initiatives 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses for the fiscal year ended december   decreased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  pre opening expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to the opening of four new stores in fiscal as compared to the opening of new and relocated stores in fiscal interest expense  net 
net interest expense for the fiscal year ended december   increased to million from million in fiscal  due to higher average borrowings in fiscal and higher swap related interest rates on the term portion of the credit facility in fiscal as part of the october amendment to our prior credit facility  the interest rate on the facility was amended to either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates increase by starting january  and each six months thereafter through january  restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal the following tables summarize the components of restructuring and asset impairment charges and income for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  by quarter in thousands fiscal components of charge nd quarter rd quarter th quarter total fixed asset impairment change in estimate related to fixed asset impairment lease related liabilities for sites identified to be sold or closed change in estimates related to lease related liabilities for sites previously identified for closure or sale severance for employees total fiscal components of charge nd quarter th quarter total fixed asset impairment change in estimate related to fixed asset impairment lease related liabilities for sites identified to be sold or closed change in estimates related to lease related liabilities for sites identified to be sold or closed severance for employees total a total of million in restructuring and asset impairment charges were taken in fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements note restructuring and asset impairment charges for details of the significant components of restructuring and asset impairment charges for fiscal and fiscal  by quarter 
restructuring and asset impairment charges fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we made certain decisions relating to the strategic repositioning of the company s operations  which resulted in a restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
these decisions included the closure of three natural foods stores during the second quarter of fiscal million  the planned sale or closure of seven stores during the remainder of fiscal million  exit costs of previously closed or abandoned sites million  and the discontinuance of e commerce activities 
the million charge related to changes in estimates for previously closed or abandoned sites 
the significant components of the million charge were a million of additional lease related liabilities  and b million of fixed asset impairments for previously closed stores 
components of the restructuring and asset impairment charge consist of impairment of fixed million and intangible assets million  and non cancelable lease obligations and liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses when initially recorded 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expanded the strategic repositioning and  as a part of such expansion  decided to close or sell underperforming stores 
this decision resulted in an additional restructuring and asset impairment charge of million 
this restructuring charge consists primarily of costs associated with the abandonment of fixed million and intangible assets million and non cancelable lease obligations and lease related liabilities million 
substantially all of the restructuring charges are non cash expenses

income tax benefit 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a million income tax benefit  primarily as a result of the loss before taxes of million during the period 
the recoverability of the net deferred tax asset is primarily dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements to disclose as required by item a of regulation s k 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations which includes trade payables  bank indebtedness  and the sale of equity securities 
primary uses of cash have been the financing of new store development  new store openings  relocations  remodels  replacement capital expenditures and acquisitions and repayment of debt 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal cash from operating activities increased during this period primarily due to pre tax income  partially offset by changes in working capital items 
we have not required significant external financing to support inventory requirements at our existing and new stores because we have been able to rely on vendor financing for most of the inventory costs  and we anticipate that vendor financing will continue to be available for new store openings 
net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal the decrease is due to a reduction in capital expenditures for the construction of new stores fewer stores and lower cost per store 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal as compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the change reflects lower incremental borrowings under our credit facility 
we have a net deferred tax asset of million on our balance sheet  primarily as a result of the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal the net deferred tax asset will reduce cash required for payment of federal and state income taxes  as we believe we will generate sufficient taxable income for realization of the asset in the future 
the following is a summary of our lease and debt obligations  construction commitments and outstanding letters of credit as of december  summary of obligations and commercial commitments in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases construction commitments total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years other commercial commitments letters of credit total commercial commitments refinancing of credit facility 
our former credit facility had two separate lines of credit  a revolving line and a term loan facility  both expiring august  as of december   there were in borrowings under the revolving line  and in borrowings outstanding under the term loan 
interest at december  primarily accrued at a rate of libor plus  or per annum after adjusting for the impact of the swap agreement required by our credit facility 
in february of  we completed the refinancing of our credit facility with wells fargo bank na  our former administrative agent  again acting as lead bank and administrative agent 
our new facility has a million limit  which we believe to be adequate for our current borrowing needs  with a three year term with a one year renewal option 
under the new facility  we have the option to increase the total facility to million through the addition of new lenders and through the agreement of the current lending group to increase their total commitments 
as part of the new facility  we have given our lenders collateral in the form of cash  equipment and fixtures  inventory and other assets 
we have also granted leasehold mortgages in those leasehold interests previously mortgaged to secure our former credit facility  although we have no obligation to provide an interest in any new leaseholds 
the new facility contains limitations on capital expenditures and the signing of new leases  although we believe such limitations will not restrict our previously announced growth plans of to stores in fiscal  to stores in fiscal and to stores in fiscal the interest rate on the facility is currently either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates modify depending on the ratio of average total funded debt  as defined under the credit facility  plus six times rent expense  to ebitdar for the four fiscal quarter periods then ended  as calculated on our quarterly compliance certificate 
additionally  we are charged a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line ranging from to based on performance objectives as defined in the credit agreement 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure requirements in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to comply with the monthly and quarterly financial covenants in the credit agreement 
in the event that business conditions worsen  management has identified contingency actions to enable the company to remain in compliance with the financial covenants 
even if we remain in compliance with our monetary covenants  a technical default could result due to a breach of the financial covenants 
in the absence of a waiver or amendment to such financial covenants  such non compliance would constitute a default under the credit agreement  and the lenders would be entitled to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness outstanding thereunder 
in the event that such non compliance appears likely  or occurs  we will seek approval  as we have in the past  from the lenders to renegotiate financial covenants and or obtain waivers  as required 
however  there can be no assurance that future amendments or waivers will be obtained 
we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy  which was required by our former credit facility terms  that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in interest rates 
the company s specific goals are to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of some of its debt and lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
in accordance with the company s interest rate risk management strategy  and in accordance with the requirements of our former credit facility  the company entered into a swap agreement to hedge the interest rate on million of its borrowings 
the swap agreement locks in a one month libor rate of and expires in august under our new facility  we are not obligated to enter into any such rate contracts  however  we may choose to do so if we believe such to be appropriate and in line with our risk management strategy 
capital expenditures 
we spent approximately million during fiscal for new store construction  development  remodels and other capital expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions 
capital expenditures originally planned for certain of the stores rescheduled to open in fiscal were incurred commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal our average capital expenditures to open a leased store  including leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures  have ranged from approximately million to million historically  excluding inventory costs and initial operating losses 
as part of our reexamination of our operating strategies  we anticipate that the average capital expenditures to open a natural foods supermarket format store will be million to million in the future  partly because of our decision to reduce the size or simplify the format of our food service department in new stores  as well as our decision not to increase store size in the majority of geographic areas  however  our ability to negotiate turnkey leases in the future will result in a substantially lower capital expenditure per store  in return for a slightly higher rent rate over the lease term 
our average capital expenditures to open a farmers market format store are estimated at million to million in the future 
delays in opening new stores may result in increased capital expenditures and increased pre opening costs for the site  as well as lower than planned sales for the company 
the cost of initial inventory for a new store is approximately  to  depending on the store format  however  we obtain vendor financing for most of this cost 
pre opening costs currently are approximately  to  per store and are expensed as incurred 
pre opening costs for natural foods supermarket format stores in the future are projected to increase from  to  per store  and pre opening costs for farmers market format stores are projected to increase from  to  as a result of increased advertising for new stores 
the amounts and timing of such pre opening costs will depend upon the availability of new store sites and other factors  including the location of the store and whether it is in a new or existing market for us  the size of the store  and the required build out at the site 
costs to acquire future stores  if any  are impossible to predict and could vary materially from the cost to open new stores 
there can be no assurance that actual capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated levels  although our amended credit facility contains aggregate limits on the amounts of capital expenditures we may make 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our budgeted cash requirements through fiscal cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this report on form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  which involve known and unknown risks 
such forward looking statements include statements as to the company s plans to open  acquire or relocate additional stores  the anticipated performance of such stores  the impact of competition and current economic uncertainty  the sufficiency of funds to satisfy the company s cash requirements through the remainder of fiscal  our expectations for comparable store sales  the impact of changes resulting from our merchandising  advertising and pricing programs  levels of cannibalization  expected pre opening expenses and capital expenditures  and other statements containing words such as believes  anticipates  estimates  expects  may  intends and words of similar import or statements of management s opinion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and the value of foreign currency 
the company employs various financial instruments to manage certain exposures when practical 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company owns and operates three natural foods supermarkets and a commissary kitchen in british columbia  canada 
the commissary supports the three canadian stores and does not independently generate sales revenue 
sales made from the canadian stores are made in exchange for canadian dollars 
to the extent that those revenues are repatriated to the united states  the amounts repatriated are subject to the exchange rate fluctuations between the two currencies 
the company does not hedge against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes is primarily related to its variable rate debt issued under its credit facility 
as of december   there was million in borrowings outstanding under our former credit facility 
the interest rate under the former credit facility at december  was either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election 
because the interest rate on the former facility was variable  the company s interest expense and net income were affected by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result under the former facility  based upon the existing outstanding non hedged variable rate debt as of december   would be an annual increase or decrease of approximately  in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of approximately  in the company s net income after taxes 
on february   the company refinanced the credit facility and reduced the total commitment available to a million revolving line of credit  with a three year term expiring february  the interest rate on the amended facility is currently either prime plus or one month libor plus  at our election  and the rates modify depending on the ratio of average total funded debt  as defined under the credit facility  plus six times rent expense  to ebitdar for the four fiscal quarter periods then ended  as calculated on our quarterly compliance certificate 
because the interest rate on the facility is variable  based upon the prime rate or libor  the company s interest expense and net income are affected by interest rate fluctuations 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding non hedged variable rate debt as of march   would be an annual increase or decrease of approximately  in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of approximately  in the company s net income after taxes 
in september  as required by the company s former credit facility  the company entered into an interest rate swap to hedge its exposure on variable rate debt positions 
variable rates are predominantly linked to libor as determined by one month intervals 
the interest rate provided by the swap fixed one month libor at 
at december   the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap agreement was million  expiring in august there is no obligation to renew the swap under the refinanced facility 
the notional amount is the amount used for the calculation of interest payments that are exchanged over the life of the swap transaction on the amortized principal balance 
in fiscal  the loss  net of taxes  included in other comprehensive loss for this cash flow hedge was approximately million
