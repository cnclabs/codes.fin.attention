the processing of scrap generates solid waste in the form of salt cake and baghouse dust 
this material is disposed of at off site landfills or at the company s permitted disposal sites at two of its facilities 
if salt cake were ever classified as a hazardous waste or substance under rcra or cercla  the company would have to modify its handling and disposal practices 
the company might then also have to obtain a rcra subchapter c permit for its morgantown  kentucky landfill  obtain other permits including transportation permits  and landfill additional amounts of salt cake with third parties not under the company s direct control 
based on current annual processing volumes  planned utilization rates and remaining landfill capacity  the estimated remaining life of the company s landfill at its sapulpa  oklahoma plant is four years 
the 
table of contents company estimates that phase two of its morgantown  kentucky landfill cell has a remaining useful life of approximately one year 
remaining landfill life at morgantown is estimated by using independent aerial photography and engineering calculations based on that photography 
when the current morgantown landfill was originally permitted  it was anticipated that there would be three phases to this landfill site 
the company is currently operating in the second phase 
a planned expansion at this landfill in the third phase is anticipated to provide an additional six years of useful life 
landfill closure costs for company owned landfills are currently estimated to be approximately  the current balance of landfill closure accrued costs is  this amount is included in the balance sheet classification other long term liabilities 
the company is currently providing for this expenditure by accruing  on a current basis  these estimated costs as the landfills are used

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general tolling and product sales business approximately of the company s total processing volumes consists of aluminum tolled for its customers 
tolling revenues reflect only the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
the company s activities also involve processing  recovery and specialty alloying of aluminum and zinc metal and the production of value added zinc products for sale by the company 
the revenues from these sales transactions include the cost of the metal  as well as the processing cost and the company s profit margin 
accordingly  tolling business produces lower revenues and costs of sales than product sales 
table of contents business 
variations in the mix between tolling and product sales business could cause revenue amounts to change significantly from period to period while not significantly affecting gross profit 
as a result  the company considers processing volume to be a more important determinant of performance than revenues 
in  the company experienced a decrease in the percentage of metals tolled  compared to the post falls  loudon and coldwater facilities all had large percentage reductions in tolling volume due to the loss of business from key tolling customers 
this tolling volume reduction was offset by increased product sales volumes at the rockwood  coldwater and shelbyville facilities  in addition to the new product sales business at monterrey  mexico and pindamonhangaba  brazil 
over the past three years  the company has taken steps to counter the reduced demand it has experienced at its us operations 
the company has closed two aluminum recycling facilities  one zinc recycling facility  provisionally suspended operations at an aluminum recycling facility and has reduced the number of furnaces it operates at other domestic facilities 
the company has redeployed some of these assets to its joint venture in monterrey  mexico 
while the company had restructuring events  it took no special restructuring expense and recorded the cost associated with these activities into current operations as cost of goods sold 
as a result of the company s restructuring activities  the company has achieved a higher rate of units processed per employee  lower unit operating costs and has improved its overall profitability 
the following table shows information concerning total pounds processed  total revenues and total gross profits in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  pounds processed percent of pounds tolled revenues gross profits in addition to its product sales business  the company also enters into metal brokerage transactions under which the company buys metal from primary and other producers and then sells the metal to end users 
these transactions involve buying and selling metal without processing it 
also  in order to facilitate acquiring metal for its production processing  the company occasionally enters into metal swap transactions where the company agrees to exchange its recycled finished goods for scrap raw materials 
as with the product sales business  the brokerage business increases the company s working capital requirements and subjects the company to greater price risk associated with fluctuations in the metals commodities markets

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management uses historical experience and available information to make these estimates and judgments  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include credit risk of its customers  accounting for inventories  property and equipment  accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  and tax matters 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and additional information concerning the estimates and judgments required are included in note a summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company reviews its inventory values on a regular basis 
cost is determined using either a specific identification method or a weighted average cost per product sold  and includes an allocation of average manufacturing labor and overhead costs to finished goods 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in demand requirements could lead to depressed market conditions and the company would be required to record the appropriate adjustment to inventory levels 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
landfill closure costs are estimated and accrued as space in the landfills is used 
the company uses aerial photography and engineering calculations based on that photography to determine the space used 
the construction costs of the landfills are depreciated as space in the landfills is used 
the estimation of the closure costs is determined by an engineering study conducted by an independent third party engaged by the company 
the estimation is based on various factors  including historical utilization of the landfill 
in the event that the current utilization rate changes drastically from historical rates  the company would be required to record an adjustment to the accrual 
the company currently has some assets classified as available for sale 
these assets are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value 
assets held in this category are actively marketed  and the company s policy is to expeditiously sell those assets not intended for future use in income producing activities 
the company reviews its property and equipment for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset  less disposal costs 
intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost 
the company annually performs an impairment review to estimate the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the valuation entails a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the company s reporting units  utilizing a discount rate based on a risk 
table of contents adjusted weighted average cost of capital for each unit 
when estimating future cash flows  the company uses internal projections and budgets 
these projections include assumptions about aluminum and zinc prices  as well as natural gas and other operating costs 
due to the inherit volatility of commodity prices  actual results may vary from these projections  and could require an adjustment to be recorded 
in the event that a reporting unit s valuation was determined to be lower than the net book value of such reporting unit  the company would be required to perform a purchase price allocation of the reporting unit s fair value and liabilities to the estimated fair value of its assets 
any goodwill recorded in excess of the resulting goodwill from the purchase price allocation is deemed impaired 
see impact of recently issued accounting standards below 
credit risk the majority of the company s accounts receivable are due from companies in the aluminum  zinc and automotive industries 
credit is extended based on evaluation of the customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in recent periods and may occur in the future if the company s evaluation of a client s ability to pay proves to be incorrect 
environmental the accounting policy with respect to contingent environmental liabilities is to record the company s environmental liabilities when and if environmental assessment and or remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company s estimate of these liabilities is based on various assumptions and judgments 
the company often cannot predict with certainty the total costs  liability with respect to these total costs  or the timing of the ultimate disposition of the matter 
due to these uncertainties  the precision of the estimated liability may be subject to significant changes 
income taxes the company records deferred income taxes to reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that  in the company s estimate  are more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income and future tax rates 
in the event that the company s future income is more or less than estimated  the company s future tax expense could increase or decrease to reflect the change in these estimated valuation allowances 
the company has not recorded a provision for taxes for undistributed earnings of the company s non us investment in its german joint venture  since these earnings have been considered permanently reinvested 
market risk management using financial instruments in order to manage its price exposure for natural gas purchases  the company has fixed the future price of a portion of its natural gas requirements by entering into financial hedge agreements 
under these 
table of contents agreements  payments are made or received based on the differential between the monthly closing price on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and the actual hedge price 
these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with all gains and losses recognized in cost of sales when the gas is consumed 
in addition  the company has cost escalators included in many of its long term supply contracts with its customers  which limit the company s exposure to natural gas price risk 
in  and  natural gas hedging activities increased decreased cost of goods sold by the following respective amounts   and  respectively 
the company has entered into futures contracts and a series of put and call option contracts with metal brokers to cover the future selling prices on a portion of the aluminum generated by the company s salt cake processing facility in morgantown  kentucky  as well as some of the aluminum generated from the processing of other scrap metal 
in addition  the company has entered into futures contracts with metal brokers to cover the future selling prices of zinc recycled for certain zinc customers under fixed price contracts 
these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges  and are settled in the month of the corresponding production and or shipment  with all gains and losses recognized in revenues 
the counter parties to the financial hedge agreements and futures contracts discussed above expose the company to losses in the event of non performance  however  company management currently knows of no reason to anticipate any non performance by existing counter parties 
the counter parties are evaluated for creditworthiness and risk assessment prior to initiating trading activities with the brokers 
typically  the company does not require collateral or post collateral to support broker transactions 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effective january   the company adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas as discussed above  the company enters into production derivatives to hedge the cost of energy and the sales price of certain aluminum and zinc products  and evaluates and documents each hedge item when entered into

during  factors that adversely affected the company s results of operations and financial condition included 
table of contents lower average operating rates at the company s facilities  weak demand for the company s products and services at its domestic aluminum and zinc facilities due to the continuing downturn in us industrial production  aluminum customer plant shutdowns in the us pacific northwest  weak market conditions for aluminum customers serving the can sheet and construction sectors  a decline in the value of the brazilian currency  a continuation of declining us aluminum recycling rates  and prevailing low prices for aluminum and zinc 
for  the company expects many of these industry conditions to persist 
a continuation of the recession affecting domestic us industrial production will have a negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company continues to seek ways to reduce its operational costs through its expense reduction programs 
factors that have positively affected the company s cost structure in recent periods have included utilization of advanced  more efficient fuel burning technologies for its furnaces  more effective use of commodities hedges and working capital management techniques  the company s centralized purchasing and customer credit management function  better reallocation of processing volumes among its facilities  and improvements in metal preparation techniques and increased automation at company facilities 
the use of more efficient fuel burning technologies for its furnaces offset the effect of increased natural gas prices experienced at company plants during a positive contributor to company results of operations during was the company s aluminum specialty alloys business  which experienced increased volumes  higher prices for its alloy products and lower scrap costs 
this business remained stronger than expected during  due to the continued high rate of production for auto manufacturers  both in the us and overseas 
margins in the company s specialty alloys business are expected to tighten in  but the performance of this business will largely depend on the level of us auto production 
if current estimates of lower us automotive sales in prove correct  management does not expect the company s aluminum specialty alloys business to perform in as well as it did in in march  ford and gm announced production cutbacks for the second quarter of however  the use of aluminum in automobiles continues to increase  and is expected to increase overall by this year  to an average of pounds of aluminum per vehicle  according to industry sources 
continuing deterioration in the us national aluminum recycling rate and slower demand for the company s aluminum recycling services has caused the company s percentage of tolling activities relative to its total volumes processed to decline in recent periods 
as this trend continues  the company will be exposed to increased working capital requirements that are required for increased levels of product sales 
additionally  the company may experience more volatility in earnings and cash flows since it will experience additional market and commodity risk through its ownership of the metal units to be sold

company management currently expects that the company s results of operations for should outperform s results 
the degree of improvement will depend in large part upon a recovery in demand for us industrial production  the rate of production in the us automotive sector  and the company s ability to successfully integrate its foreign operations 
for any significant improvement in results to occur  higher plant operating rates and increased demand and prices for the company s products and services over those currently prevailing will be required 
assuming that i the us economy recovers in  ii the company can continue its international expansion program as planned  and iii the cost savings experienced in and continue to be realized  overall company profitability should improve 
however  if the economy further weakens  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
unexpected defaults and insolvencies involving its suppliers and customers  which occurred in and  could further diminish the company s prospects 
the company is currently constrained by the terms of its credit facilities for its sources of capital with regards to many expansion and acquisition opportunities 
both its revolving credit and receivables sales facilities expire by their terms in late  and all outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility has been reclassified as a current liability 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
although management believes that alternative facilities for capital funding are available and will be in place before the end of the first half of  it should be expected that the company s borrowing costs will increase in compared to its borrowing costs for no assurances can be made that any of these anticipated results will actually be achieved  and if so  when and the degree that they can be accomplished

table of contents aluminum production during  the company melted less aluminum than it did during an overall weakening in demand  caused by the slowing economy  affected production 
the decrease in aluminum percentage tolled is primarily due to the reduction in volume at the post falls facility  which is related to the loss of tolling business from a major customer in the pacific northwest and weakness in the can recycling market 
this was offset by increases at the company s specification alloy plants  particularly at the saginaw facility which is currently almost dedicated to toll processing  and increased volumes from mexico and brazil 
zinc production during  the company melted more zinc than it did during the increase can be attributed to greater demand from customers in the zinc oxide and zinc dust businesses
