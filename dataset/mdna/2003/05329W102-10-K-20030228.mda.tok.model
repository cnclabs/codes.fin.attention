consolidated results of operations autonation  inc is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from dealerships located in major metropolitan markets in states  predominantly in the sunbelt region of the united states 
our dealerships  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known dealerships in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by ford  general motors  daimler chrysler  toyota  nissan  honda and bmw 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  vehicle maintenance and repair services  vehicle parts  extended service contracts  vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products 
we also arrange financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  reducing redundant operating expenses  improving asset management and sharing and implementing best practices across our dealerships 
as further discussed in note  prior year reclassifications and disaggregations  of notes to consolidated financial statements  certain amounts have been reclassified from the previously reported financial statements and disaggregations of certain disclosures have been made to conform with the financial statement presentation of the current period 
the reclassifications include the presentation of floorplan interest expense below operating income

net income  excluding certain charges and gains above is presented on a basis other than accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the above information is presented for informational purposes only and may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
set forth below are the policies that we have identified as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations or that involve significant estimates 
for detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets our policies related to intangible assets determine the valuation of intangible assets  which is a significant component of our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  these policies affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
intangible assets consist primarily of the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method  eliminating the pooling of interests method 
additionally  acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
our principal identifiable intangible assets are franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers 
these franchise agreements have indefinite lives 
effective january   we also adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with identified lives existing at june  were amortized primarily over forty years on a straight line basis until december  effective january   such amortization ceased 
other intangibles with definite lives continue to be amortized primarily over three to fifteen years 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment annually at june or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that intangible assets become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the related underlying business 
self insurance under self insurance programs  we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits  per claim deductibles and claims handling expenses  as part of our various insurance programs  including property and casualty and employee medical benefits 
costs in excess of this retained risk per claim are insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers 
the ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by actuarial evaluation based on historical claim settlement experience  adjusted for current trends and changes in claims handling procedures 
while we believe our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated liability for these reserves could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions 
see further discussion in note  insurance  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies as further discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements we are involved  and will continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  class actions  purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and assert available defenses with respect to each of these matters 
where necessary  we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these proceedings based on consultation with outside counsel  assuming various strategies 
further  we may have certain 
table of contents insurance coverage and rights of indemnification with respect to certain aspects of these matters 
however  a settlement or an adverse resolution of one or more of these matters may result in the payment of significant costs and damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
in june  we completed the tax free spin off of our former automotive rental business  anc rental 
anc rental declared bankruptcy in november we were called on to perform under certain of our credit enhancements and guarantees in and may be subject to future exposure related to these credit enhancements  guarantees or additional claims 
see further discussion under the heading discontinued business segments 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is from the sales of new and used vehicles  including any commissions from related vehicle financings 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered 
rebates and holdbacks received from manufacturers are recorded as offsets to the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
revenue on finance products represents commissions earned by us for loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed and is recognized upon acceptance of customer credit by the financial institution 
an estimated liability for chargebacks against revenue recognized from sales of finance and vehicle protection products is established during the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit  pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  that would be recognized over the life of the policies 
through  we reinsured some or all of the underwriting risk related to extended warranty and credit insurance products sold and administered by certain independent third parties through our captive insurance subsidiaries 
revenue and related direct costs from these reinsurance transactions were deferred and are recognized over the life of the policies 
effective january   we no longer reinsure any new extended warranty and credit insurance products 
in the future  should changes in conditions cause us to determine that these criteria have not been met  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
finance and lease underwriting in december  we decided that we would no longer underwrite retail auto loans for customers at our dealerships and incurred a pre tax charge in of million to reflect a write down of our outstanding auto loans and related assets in our portfolio and to cover costs associated with our exit from that business 
we continue to manage and wind down our outstanding loan and lease portfolios and related assets 
accordingly  we remain subject to consumer credit risk in connection with our portfolio of installment receivables  our lease portfolio and other related assets 
additionally  we are subject to the risk that based on certain estimates and assumptions used  our portfolio of installment receivables  our lease portfolio and other related assets could be overvalued and require additional write down 
see further discussion in note  finance underwriting and asset securitizations  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
in and  we engaged in certain transactions that the internal revenue service irs is challenging 
approximately million of the net deferred tax liabilities relate to these transactions

gross profit was billion in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary components of these changes are described below 
new vehicle revenue decreased to billion in compared to due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
on a same store basis  new vehicle revenue decreased in compared to due to a decrease in volume of partially offset by a increase in average revenue per unit 
although we have continued to benefit from high levels of consumer incentive programs from the manufacturers introduced during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decrease in volume in consistent with industry declines of retail unit sales 
we expect industry wide new vehicles sales in the united states during to decrease by an estimated three to five percent compared to 
table of contents on a unit basis 
however  the level of retail sales for is very difficult to predict 
we have experienced lower than expected vehicle sales to date during  which we attribute in part to the impact of the prospects of war on consumer demand for vehicles 
continued uncertainty regarding the prospects of war or a prolonged war could materially adversely impact our vehicle sales and overall business 
in  new vehicle sales were affected by lower demand experienced in the domestic product lines 
the introduction of significant manufacturer incentives greatly increased the pace of new vehicle sales during the final three months of reported new vehicle gross profit decreased in to million  primarily the result of a decrease in same store gross profit partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
on a same store basis  new vehicle gross profit decreased  in large part due to volume decreases as well as slight margin compression 
new vehicle days supply was days at december  up days from december  we believe that the level is appropriately balanced as we enter the selling season 
we manage our inventory to minimize inventory carrying costs floorplan interest expense net of floorplan assistance from manufacturers  which decreased million in versus  primarily as the result of lower interest rates 
while interest rates are at an all time low  we expect modest increases in floorplan interest rates in we believe the effect of the increases will be partially offset by increases in floorplan interest assistance from the vehicle manufacturers  which is also interest rate sensitive  although we do not expect to realize the same level of benefit from net inventory carrying costs as we did during net inventory carrying costs decreased million in versus due to inventory management activities and lower interest rates 
used vehicle revenue decreased to billion in compared to due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
on a same store basis  used vehicle revenue decreased in compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in volume of  which was in large part caused by continued strong manufacturer incentives and zero percent financing for new vehicles as well as a more restrictive financing environment for used vehicles 
reported used vehicle gross profit decreased to million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in same store revenue partially offset by the impact of acquisitions 
same store used vehicle gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased basis points to compared to due to pricing pressures resulting from manufacturer new vehicle incentives and an oversupply of used vehicles in the marketplace 
consistent with decreases in new vehicle sales  we have experienced lower than expected used vehicle sales to date during in  used vehicle revenue on a reported basis was relatively flat compared to gross profit in decreased compared to due to an uncertain wholesale market  which resulted in our decision to retail used vehicle inventory whenever possible as part of our inventory management practices 
parts and service revenue increased to billion in compared to driven by the impact of acquisitions 
on a reported basis  parts and service gross profit increased to billion during the year ended december   as a result of higher revenue coupled with margin expansion of basis points to 
revenue and gross profit remained relatively flat in compared to on a same store basis 
revenue was impacted by reduced warranty volume from domestic manufacturers  a soft collision repair market and comparisons to  which included a large manufacturer recall 
as a percentage of same store revenue  parts and service same store gross profit increased basis points to as a result of our continued implementation of a pricing strategy  a team based service process and a comprehensive marketing plan 
parts and service revenue and gross profit increased in compared to primarily driven by parts and service initiatives 
despite a decrease in vehicle sales during  finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased to million in compared to on a same store basis  finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased 
finance and insurance revenue and gross profit increased to million in compared to finance and insurance gross profit per vehicle retailed increased in to compared to in increases are primarily due to increased product penetration as a result of our continued standardization of product pricing and our menu based finance and insurance sales process  which facilitates sales particularly in a low interest rate environment 
other revenue  primarily consisting of wholesale revenue from the sale of used vehicles  decreased to billion in compared to this revenue decrease primarily reflects a reduction in the number of 
table of contents units wholesaled due to an overall decline in new and used vehicle sales 
other gross profit  which includes the results of reinsurance and retrospective basis commissions on extended warranty contracts  fees from preferred lender arrangements  and wholesale and fleet operations  increased million or to million in compared to the increase was driven by income realized due to claims experience improvements on our extended warranty portfolio as well as higher fees from preferred lender financing arrangements  which may not be indicative of future performance 
in  other revenue decreased compared to due to a reduction in the number of units wholesaled 
other gross profit decreased in compared to as a result of a reduction in wholesale and fleet revenue 
in  we focused on cost management initiatives in the areas of compensation  advertising and general and administrative expenses 
store selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in compared to on a same store basis  store selling  general and administrative expenses decreased or million 
the decrease in store selling  general and administrative expenses during was driven by decreased compensation expenses in part due to staffing reductions partially offset by slightly higher advertising and other miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in compared to is primarily due to increased advertising and other miscellaneous expenses 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in is primarily the result of investments in strategic initiatives and related infrastructure 
the decrease is primarily the result of the continued disposal of excess properties 
as a percentage of gross profit  corporate selling  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to total approximately million to million in we will continue our focus on cost management in  although we expect increased insurance  strategic initiative and employee medical benefit costs  which would have the effect of offsetting some of the expected cost savings at both the store and corporate levels 
depreciation was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of capital expenditures 
due to higher capital expenditure levels in  depreciation in is expected to total approximately million to million 
amortization was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

the net charge in is primarily the result of an additional impairment charge based on the re evaluation of the fair value of certain properties 
in the net recovery is primarily due to a net gain on properties placed back in service or retained totaling million offset by an additional impairment charge of million recognized primarily as a result of a decision in to close an additional megastore property as part of the restructuring 
see discussion under heading restructuring activities 
other losses of million for the year ended december  were primarily the result of a property write down partially offset by a gain on the transfer of reinsurance agreements as further discussed under the heading financial condition

table of contents years ended december  operating items as a percentage of revenue gross profit new vehicle used vehicle parts and service finance and insurance other total in  we focused on operational improvements in the high profit areas of our business parts and service and finance and insurance 
although these areas collectively comprise of total same store revenue  they contributed of total same store gross profit in we also benefited from our focus on cost management initiatives  resulting in a decrease to same store selling  general and administrative expenses of million or compared to discontinued business segments on june   we completed the spin off of our former automotive rental businesses  which were organized under anc rental corporation together with its subsidiaries anc rental  by distributing of anc rental s common stock to autonation s stockholders as a tax free dividend 
as a result of the spin off  autonation stockholders received one share of anc rental common stock for every eight shares of autonation common stock owned as of the june  record date 
as discussed in note  discontinued operations  of notes to consolidated financial statements  anc rental has been accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accordingly  the operating results of anc rental have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the spin off of anc rental corporation in june  we agreed to provide certain guarantees and credit enhancements with respect to financial and other performance obligations of anc rental  including acting as a guarantor under certain motor vehicle and real property leases between anc rental and mitsubishi motor sales of america  inc mitsubishi and acting as an indemnitor with respect to certain surety bonds issued on anc rental s behalf 
we are also a party to certain agreements with anc rental the anc rental agreements  including a separation and distribution agreement  a reimbursement agreement and a tax sharing agreement  pursuant to which both anc rental and we have certain obligations 
on november   anc rental filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code with the us bankruptcy court in wilmington  delaware 
in connection with anc rental s bankruptcy  we were called on to perform under nine of the twelve real property leases between anc rental and mitsubishi for which we provided guarantees 
as a result  we agreed to assume these real property leases  which expire in  in order to control and attempt to mitigate our exposure relating thereto 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a pre tax charge of million included in net income from discontinued operations to reflect our assumption of the nine leases with mitsubishi and certain other costs that we expect to incur as a result of anc rental s bankruptcy 
we continue to guarantee the remaining three leases with mitsubishi until their expiration in  and we expect to be called on to perform under at least two of these leases during as of december   we have accrued liabilities of approximately million that we believe are adequate to cover our probable exposures related to these leases 
anc rental has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  we expect that additional charges recorded by us pursuant to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees or with respect to claims under the anc rental agreements  if any  would not impact our reported results from continuing operations 
we reached an agreement with mitsubishi in early pursuant to which our aggregate financial exposure relating to motor vehicles leased by anc rental from mitsubishi is capped at million 
based on anc rental s continued performance under the motor vehicle lease agreement  we believe our financial 
table of contents exposure under the agreement will be minimal 
our indemnification obligations with respect to the surety bonds issued on behalf of anc rental are capped at million in the aggregate 
we could have potential exposure under the indemnification obligations until approximately due to the bankruptcy of anc rental  obligations of anc rental to us under the terms of the anc rental agreements may be extinguished or our claims against anc rental under such agreements may be unenforceable 
these claims could include reimbursement obligations that anc rental may have to us in connection with payments made by us with respect to the foregoing credit enhancements and guarantees  as well as indemnification rights with respect to any payments that we make to the internal revenue service as a result of audit adjustments in our consolidated federal income tax returns relating to anc rental s automotive rental businesses prior to the spin off 
such audit adjustments  if any  would likely be resolved in the next two to four years 
we estimate that  based on our assessment of the risks involved in each matter and excluding the liabilities associated with the property leases discussed above  our remaining potential exposure related to anc rental may be in the range of million to million 
however  the exposure is difficult to estimate and we cannot assure you that our aggregate obligations under these credit enhancements  guarantees and anc rental agreements will not be materially above the range indicated above  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and prospects 
we have filed various claims against anc rental in the bankruptcy  including claims related to these credit enhancements  guarantees and anc rental agreements 
these claims may be discharged  in whole or in part  in the bankruptcy 
the committee of unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy is presently investigating potential claims against us in connection with our prior ownership and spin off of anc rental  including claims that anc rental was undercapitalized at the time of the spin off 
there can be no assurances that we will not be subject to these or other additional claims as a result of anc rental s bankruptcy filing 
if any such potential claims were to be brought against us  we would vigorously defend ourselves and assert available defenses 
however  there can be no assurances that we would prevail in any such claims  or that a failure to prevail would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows and prospects 
in july  our former solid waste subsidiary  republic services  inc  completed an initial public offering of of its common stock 
in may  we sold substantially all of our interest in republic services in a public offering 
our remaining interest was sold in business acquisitions and divestitures during the years ended december   and  we acquired various automotive retail businesses 
we paid approximately million  million and million  respectively  in cash for these acquisitions  all of which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

in november  we completed the divestiture of our outdoor media business for a purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with the sale  we entered into a prepaid million advertising agreement and  therefore  we received net proceeds of million 
a pre tax gain of million was recognized on the sale 
see note  acquisitions and divestitures  of notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of business combinations 
loan and lease underwriting activities in december  we decided to exit the business of underwriting retail automobile loans for customers at our dealerships  which we determined was not a part of our core automotive retail business 
we continue to 
table of contents provide automobile loans for our customers through unrelated third party financing sources  which historically had provided more than of the auto loans made to our customers 
the decision to exit the loan underwriting business and the impact of the economic conditions referenced above caused us to incur asset impairment and related charges totaling million recorded in december these charges mainly reflect the impact of expected increases in loan losses and prepayments  as well as higher expected loan servicing costs 
the charges also include million of direct exit costs for asset write offs and other costs 
in addition  during and  we recognized impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively  primarily associated with the deterioration in residual values of finance lease receivables 
we discontinued the writing of finance leases in mid loan and lease underwriting income was million for the year ended december  the income in is the result of our continued focus on the management of our finance receivables and improved collections as part of our exit from the business of underwriting retail automobile loans 
at december   we had finance receivables totaling million which are expected to be substantially collected through see discussion of key economic assumptions and other information in note  finance underwriting and asset securitizations  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring activities during  we approved a restructuring plan to exit the used vehicle megastore business and reduce the corporate workforce 
approximately  positions were eliminated as a result of the restructuring plan of which  were megastore positions and were corporate positions 
these restructuring activities resulted in pre tax charges of million in the restructuring plan also included divesting of certain non core franchised dealerships 
during and  we received million and million  respectively  of cash from the divestiture of certain automotive dealerships as part of our restructuring activities 
we continue to dispose of our closed megastores and other properties  including closed lease properties  through sales to third parties 
at december   properties held for sale  net totaled million  including properties with total asset value of million remaining to be sold of the total million identified as part of the restructuring plan 
despite a softening market  these properties continue to be aggressively marketed

non operating income expense floorplan interest expense floorplan interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
decreases are primarily related to lower interest rates in and while interest rates are at an all time low  we expect modest increases in floorplan interest rates in we believe the effect of the increases will be partially offset by increases in floorplan interest assistance from the vehicle manufacturers  which is also interest rate sensitive  although we do not expect to realize the same level of benefit from net inventory carrying costs as we did during subsequent to year end  we entered into a series of interest rate hedge transactions designed to mitigate our exposure to certain floating interest rate liabilities 
as of february   we have executed million of notional value hedges which mature over the next three years 
other interest expense during  other interest expense was incurred primarily on borrowings under our mortgage facilities and the outstanding senior unsecured notes 
other interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in was 
table of contents primarily due to higher fixed interest expenses related to the senior unsecured notes sold in august the decrease in was due to lower average borrowings as well as lower floating interest rates partially offset by additional fixed interest expense related to the senior unsecured notes 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances  partially offset by lower interest rates 
the decrease is primarily due to lower interest rates 
we expect interest income in to decrease compared to due to the sale of our restricted investments in other income expense  net for the year ended december   other income  net was million 
as discussed under the heading financial condition  in september  one of our captive insurance companies terminated a reinsurance agreement with a third party insurance company and transferred our risk pertaining to certain extended warranty products under the reinsurance agreement back to such insurance company 
as a result of the transaction  we liquidated related restricted assets  realizing a million gain on the sale 
additionally  in  we converted our remaining restricted investments to restricted cash  realizing a million gain on the sale 
other expense  net for the year ended december   was million 
other income for the year ended december  was million  and primarily included gains of approximately million on the sale of approximately million shares of common stock of our former solid waste subsidiary  republic services  and approximately million on the sale of our former outdoor media business  offset by a million valuation write down related to an equity method investment in a privately held vehicle salvage and parts recycling business as well as a million write down to fair value of another equity method investment  subsequently sold in early at no additional gain or loss 
income taxes the provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in primarily reflects the impact of the elimination of goodwill amortization  partially offset by increases to our effective state tax rates 
as further discussed under the heading financial condition  we have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the irs with respect to the tax treatment of certain transactions 
excluding the impact of any settlement with irs  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate will be approximately in  an increase from the rate due to increases to our effective state tax rates 
financial condition at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
we have two revolving credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of million 
the day revolving credit facility provides borrowings up to million at a libor based interest rate and was renewed in august for another day term to august the five year facility  which expires in august  provides borrowings up to million at a libor based interest rate 
these facilities are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain subsidiaries  which directly or indirectly own substantially all of our dealerships  and are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries 
no amounts are drawn on these revolving credit facilities 
in the ordinary course of business  we are required to post performance and surety bonds  letters of credit  and or cash deposits as financial guarantees of our performance 
at december   surety bonds  letters of credit and cash deposits totaled million and have various expiration dates 
we do not currently provide cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit 
we have negotiated a letter of credit line as part of our 
table of contents multi year revolving credit facility 
the amount available to be borrowed under the million multi year revolving credit facility is reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by the cumulative face amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding

the timing of when these obligations will be satisfied is difficult to estimate  although we believe it is likely that the majority will be satisfied in the next five years 
seasonality our operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales and service in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models 
also  demand for cars and light trucks is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons  particularly in regions of the united states where dealerships may be subject to harsh winters 
accordingly  we expect our revenue and operating results to be generally lower in our first and fourth quarters as compared to our second and third quarters
