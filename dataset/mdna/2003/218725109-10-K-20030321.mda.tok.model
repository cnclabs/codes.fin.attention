substantially all of corillian s revenue is derived from licensing corillian s software and performing professional services for its customers  both through direct sales channels and indirect sales partners 
these professional services include implementation  custom software engineering  consulting  maintenance  training and hosting 
in most cases  corillian recognizes revenue for licenses and implementation and custom engineering services using the percentage of completion method 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized ratably over the term of the associated maintenance contract 
revenue derived from training  hosting and consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
corillian generally licenses corillian voyager on an end user basis  with its initial license fee based on a fixed number of end users 
as a customer increases its installed base of end users beyond the initial fixed number of end users  corillian s software license requires the customer to pay corillian an additional license fee to cover additional increments of end users 
for customers that provide corillian with significant strategic advantages  corillian has in the past and may in the future charge discounted license fees based on an unlimited number of end users 
cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for professional service personnel and outsourced professional service providers who are responsible for the implementation and customization of corillian s software and for maintenance and hosting 
from time to time to accommodate specific customers  corillian resells equipment and materials to these customers  and the expenses associated with the purchase of this equipment and materials are included within the cost of revenues in the period in which the resale occurs 
since incorporation  corillian has incurred substantial costs to develop and market its technology and to provide professional services 
as a result  corillian has incurred net losses in each quarter of operation since inception and has accumulated a deficit of million as of december  corillian s limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast future operating results 
as a result of the rapid evolution of corillian s business and limited operating history  corillian believes period to period comparisons of its results of operations  including its revenues and costs of revenues and operating expenses as a percentage of revenues  are not necessarily indicative of its future performance 
during the year ended december   one customer accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue  as compared to the years ended december  and  when one customer accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated revenue

under the terms of the stock purchase agreement dated november   between hatcher and corillian  approximately million shares of corillian common stock were issued or reserved for issuance for all outstanding shares of hatcher 
corillian also assumed outstanding options for  shares of the common stock of hatcher  which converted into fully vested options for  shares of corillian common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the net assets and results of operations of hatcher have been included in corillian s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition 
table of contents date

the estimate of fair value of the net assets acquired was based on an independent appraisal and management estimates 
goodwill and customer relationships were to be amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years and workforce was to be amortized over its estimated useful life of two years 
during  corillian recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which was the entire remaining balance of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from this acquisition

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires corillian to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  corillian evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
corillian bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include software revenue recognition and accruals for loss contracts and contingencies 
our policy and related procedures for software revenue recognition are summarized below 
revenue recognition 
corillian recognizes revenue from software licensing agreements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
generally  corillian s software licenses are functionally dependent on implementation and certain custom software engineering services  therefore  software licenses and implementation services  together with custom software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software  are combined and recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements  which generally include software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services  post contractual customer support  training services and hosting services  is allocated to the elements using the residual method specified in sop no 
corillian has determined that post contractual customer support  training and hosting services can be separated from software licenses  implementation and custom software engineering services because a post contractual customer support  training and hosting services are not essential to the functionality of any other element in the arrangement  and b sufficient vendor specific objective evidence exists to permit the allocation of revenue to these service elements 
vendor specific objective evidence has been established on post contractual customer support and hosting services using the price the customer is required to pay when they are sold separately the renewal rate  and on training based on the price customers are charged when 
table of contents these services are sold separately 
under the residual method  the full fair value of post contractual customer support  training  and hosting services is deferred and subsequently recognized as the services are performed 
the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for post contractual customer support  hosting and training services is allocated to software license  implementation and custom software engineering services and recognized using contract accounting 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of contract hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract hours for each contract 
corillian has the ability to make reasonable  dependable estimates relating to the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
profit estimates are subject to revision as the contract progresses towards completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period that the facts giving rise to the revision become known 
corillian reduces the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to service delivery  usage  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as deferred revenue or revenue in excess of billing  respectively 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
for certain projects  ultimate recoverability is questionable due to inherent hazards 
pursuant to sop no 
 corillian limits revenue recognition in the period to the amount of project costs incurred in the same period  and postpones recognition of profits until results can be estimated more precisely 
under this zero profit methodology  equal amounts of revenue and cost  measured on the basis of performance during the period  are presented in corillian s consolidated statements of operations 
corillian recognizes non refundable license fees paid by a reseller that has not demonstrated a history of its ability to successfully install corillian voyager in an end customer environment over the estimated implementation period for the end customer s project 
once a reseller has successfully demonstrated its ability to implement corillian voyager  corillian recognizes subsequent non refundable license fees from the reseller on future contracts as a separate element in the period in which the cash was received  assuming all other sop no 
revenue recognition criteria are met
