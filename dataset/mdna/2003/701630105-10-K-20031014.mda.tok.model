item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial information included in this annual report on form k and with factors that may affect future results set forth on page the following discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by such act 
forward looking statements express our expectations or predictions of future events or results 
they are not guarantees and are subject to many risks and uncertainties 
there are a number of factors many beyond our control that could cause actual events or results to be significantly different from those described in the forward looking statement 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this report or in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe or words of similar meaning 
they may also use words such as will  would  should  could or may 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and in part iv  item exhibits  financial statement schedules and reports on form k 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgement by our management which subjects them to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying our accounting policies  our management uses its best judgement to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  information available from other outside sources  and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve more complex management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
overview we believe we are a leading supplier of flexible interconnects principally for sale to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  military  home appliance  electronic identification and computer markets 
we believe that our development of innovative materials and processes provides us with a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete 
during the past three years  we have invested approximately million in property and equipment and approximately million in research and development to develop materials and enhance our manufacturing processes 
we believe that these expenditures will help us to meet customer demand for our products  and enable us to continue to be a technological leader in the flexible interconnect industry 
our research and development expenses are included in our cost of products sold 
in and  we were adversely affected by the economic downturn and its impact on our key customers and markets 
we have incurred operating losses during these periods of million  and have used cash to fund operations and working capital of million during this time 
we have taken certain steps to improve operating margins  including closure of facilities  downsizing of our employee base  and transfer of manufacturing operations to lower cost locations  such as the peoples republic of china 
in addition  we have worked closely with our lenders to manage through this difficult time and have obtained additional capital in and in early through sale leasebacks of selected corporate assets and the issuance of convertible debt 
as a result of the difficult environment facing us  we have had difficulty maintaining compliance with the terms and conditions of certain of our financing facilities  and at june   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our principal external financial agreement with silicon valley bank  or our guarantee of million of debt owed by our subsidiary  parlex interconnect  to citic ka wah bank  limited citic  a hong kong bank 
on september   we executed a loan modification agreement the modification agreement with silicon valley bank 
the modification agreement increases the interest rate on borrowings to the bank s prime rate as defined therein plus decreasing to prime plus after one quarter of positive operating income and to prime plus after two quarters of positive net income  respectively and amends the financial covenants 
effective october   citic entered into a supplemental deed with parlex interconnect relating to the citic loan agreement the citic loan agreement amendment  and with us the guarantee agreement amendment 
among other matters  the modification agreement  the citic loan agreement amendment and the guarantee agreement amendment modified certain restrictive financial covenants such as ebitda  current ratio  tangible net worth and total liabilities to tangible net worth 
we are and expect to remain in compliance with all of our financial covenants  as amended 
we formed a chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai  in to better serve our customers that have production facilities in asia and to more cost effectively manufacture products for worldwide distribution 
effective october   we purchased the share of parlex shanghai held by one of our joint venture partners  shanghai jinling co  ltd s jinling  increasing our equity interest in parlex shanghai to 
parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in we completed the transfer of the production of our automotive related products utilizing our palflex r technology from our methuen  massachusetts facility to parlex interconnect  a wholly owned subsidiary of parlex asia pacific limited  which is located in china 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  valuation of stock options and warrants  income taxes and other accrued expenses  including self insured health insurance claims 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product  at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time title to the product passes to the customer 
title passes to the customer according to the shipping terms negotiated between the customer and us  which occurs at the time of shipment  unless otherwise specified by the customer 
license fees and royalty income are recognized when earned 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
we value our raw material inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
work in process and finished goods are valued as a percentage of completed cost  not in excess of net realizable value 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand and  as such  our estimate of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory will change  which we will record in the period such determination was made 
raw material  work in process and finished goods inventory associated with programs cancelled by customers are fully reserved for as obsolete 
reductions in obsolescence reserves are recognized when realized 
goodwill 
effective july   we adopted the provisions of sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment  for each reporting unit  on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing our market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  to our recorded net asset value 
in order to compute the control premium adjustment  we have utilized the control premium realized by competitors or electronic manufacturers of similar size and operating characteristics in acquisitions 
if our market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  is less than our recorded net asset value  we will further evaluate the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  as required by sfas no 
 and we will record an impairment charge against the goodwill  if required  in our results of operations in the period such determination was made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except as may be set forth below under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected items in our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue 
you should read the table and the discussion below in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fiscal year ended june  total revenues cost of products sold gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss loss from operations before income taxes and minority interest net loss fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues for were million  a decrease of from million in in february  we closed our domestic palflex operations in methuen  massachusetts 
palflex is a proprietary adhesiveless double sided copper flexible circuit roll to roll manufacturing process 
revenues generated from our palflex operations in were million versus million in excluding palflex revenues from both years  total revenues grew by 
decreases in our multi layer million and laminated cable million operations were offset by strong growth in our polymer thick film million and china million operations 
in  we continued to emphasize a strategy of market diversification 
our major markets  which represent growth versus the prior year  include the home appliance market with whirlpool and maytag our largest customers  the military market with raytheon  bae and general dynamics and the computer market with strong growth from hewlett packard 
reductions in revenues occurred primarily in the automotive market driven by the closing of our domestic palflex operations 
total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of approximately  for and  for although we intend to continue developing materials and processes that we can license to third parties  we do not expect that licensing and royalty revenues will represent a significant portion of total revenues in the near term 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues  for  versus million  or of total revenues for in  cost of products sold was adversely impacted by the cost of closing the domestic palflex operation 
in  we recorded million in costs of products sold from our palflex operations on million in revenue 
in addition to operating significantly under capacity and therefore absorbing high fixed costs  we recorded severance costs for people terminated in march and capital and inventory write downs 
in addition  the methuen operation continued to experience low capacity utilization and correspondingly  significant unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in  these variances totaled approximately million and have been charged to cost of products sold 
to improve utilization in  we relocated our salem  new hampshire laminated cable business to methuen 
relocation costs of approximately  were expensed as incurred in the first half of the year 
the move was completed in january during the past year  we have made a significant investment to improve our margins through the transfer of labor intensive manufacturing operations in the united states to more cost effective locations 
a large portion of the final assembly  inspection  and test procedures previously performed in our methuen  massachusetts and salem  new hampshire facilities are now performed in mexico 
during  we completed the transfer of our palflex operations to china 
the transfer of manufacturing capabilities is costly  however this investment is core to our long term strategy for cost effective manufacturing 
although these cost reduction measures are expected to improve our gross margins  a return to profitability is predicated upon operational performance  a favorable product mix and increased sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  or of total revenues  and million or of total revenues for the comparable period in the prior year 
due to the reorganization of our sales force in mid and the staffing of several open regional positions  selling expenses increased  in the increase in selling expenses was partially offset by a  decrease in administrative expenses 
interest income 
interest income was  in compared to  in and primarily consists of interest income on short term investments 
the reduction in interest income is due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was  in and  in the interest expense represents interest incurred on our short and long term borrowings for working capital needs  interest expense associated with deferred compensation and  beginning in  interest associated with the sale leaseback of our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in methuen  massachusetts methuen facility which has been accounted for as a financing obligation 
the increase in interest expense in is due to higher average borrowing levels and to the interest associated with the sale leaseback of the methuen facility 
non operating income 
non operating income was  in and  in non operating income in represents currency exchange rate gains 
non operating expense 
non operating expense was  in and  in non operating expense primarily represents currency exchange rate losses 
our loss before income taxes and the minority interest in our chinese joint venture  parlex shanghai  was million in compared to million in we own of the equity interest in parlex shanghai and  accordingly  include parlex shanghai s results of operations  cash flows and financial position in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in compared to an effective tax rate benefit of in our effective tax rate is impacted by the proportion of our estimated annual income being earned in domestic versus foreign tax jurisdictions  the generation of tax credits and the recording of any valuation allowance 
as a result of our recent history of operating losses  uncertain future operating results  and the non compliance with certain of our debt covenants requirements  which has subsequently been waived  we determined that it is more likely than not that certain historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized 
consequently  we increased our valuation allowance by million in fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  total revenues 
total revenues in were million  a decrease of from million in revenues were generated primarily from product sales with decreases in each of our principal product lines  flexible circuits and laminated cable 
reductions in revenues in were attributable to the general decline in customer demand within the global electronics industry and a general downturn of the us economy 
parlex revenues for declined while the overall industry declined based upon calendar year data from the ipc association connecting electronic industries ipc  the premier industry trade organization with over  members including parlex 
this downturn has had a significant impact on parlex s customers and their end markets 
we experienced significant reductions in revenues from our customers in the telecommunications and networking  and computer peripheral markets  which affected all of our manufacturing operations 
the revenue decline in was partially offset by increased revenues in the military  automotive  and home appliance markets 
our revenue in the military  automotive  and home appliance markets increased an aggregate of million while overall revenues declined million from total revenues included licensing and royalty fees of approximately  for and  in the higher revenues in reflect the final installment received from the million patent assignment agreement executed with polyclad laminates  inc in cost of products sold 
in  cost of products sold was million  or of total revenues  versus million  or of total revenues for the percentage increase primarily represents million for the elimination of excess facilities   for severance costs associated with reductions in workforce  and million for increases in inventory reserves and inventory write downs 
prior to june   parlex management having the appropriate level of authority approved  communicated and committed a plan to exit our salem  new hampshire manufacturing facility 
the million for the elimination of excess facilities was comprised of  in future rental payments   for the abandonment of leasehold improvements   in facility refurbishment expenses and  in early lease termination penalty fees 
certain amounts were estimated based upon our expected exit date of january through the remaining lease commitment date of june exit of the facility was completed  as expected  in january no amounts were paid as of june during  lease costs of  consisting of rent expense and utilities for the period january  through june  were paid and charged against the facility exit costs accrual 
in january  upon exiting the facility  we wrote down the value of the leasehold improvements at our salem  new hampshire facility to zero to reflect our abandonment of such assets 
the lease termination notice was provided to the landlord on june  as required under the terms of the lease agreement  and resulted in the payment of the lease termination fee of  the following is a summary of the facility exit costs activity during facility activity facility exit costs exit costs accrued cash asset change in accrued june  payments write offs estimates june  lease costs    leasehold improvements   facility refurbishment costs    lease termination penalty    total     we expect the remaining  of accrued facility exit costs at june  consisting of twelve months of lease payments and estimated costs to refurbish the facility  to be paid within the next twelve months 
anticipated annual facility cost savings is more than  including rent savings of approximately  the severance activities relate to a reduction in force resulting from our transfer of certain production capabilities from the us to our facility in shanghai  china and consisted primarily of payments to direct labor manufacturing personnel 
payments of the severance costs of  were completed in july inventory write downs of million were unrelated to our restructuring activities mentioned above 
these write downs primarily consisted of inventory associated with specific customers who had postponed and or cancelled orders with us  including approximately million associated with nortel related business 
demand from such telecommunications infrastructure customers eroded quickly during the early stages of the telecommunications industry decline 
although we recorded initial reserves in  with no recovery in this market during  we were then forced to write down the balance of any remaining inventory associated with specific customers  as such inventory is produced to customer specifications and its resale value is limited 
during  we sold approximately  of this inventory to our original customers 
the impact on our gross margins was not  and is not expected to be  material 
additional inventory write downs were also recorded for year end physical inventory adjustments million and excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
salvage value of such inventory is not considered material 
we are not currently aware of any additional significant adverse trends as experienced within the telecommunications market 
in addition  the methuen operation continued to experience low capacity utilization in and correspondingly  significant unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in  the methuen operation generated revenues of approximately million primarily for the telecommunications market 
nortel was its single largest customer accounting for approximately million in revenues in in the fourth quarter of  our methuen operation no longer produced any product for nortel 
the loss of this business resulted in significant excess capacity in our methuen facility 
unfavorable manufacturing variances are the result of our actual production costs  namely overhead costs consisting of utilities  waste treatment  depreciation  indirect labor  and repair and maintenance costs being substantially higher than our planned or standard costs 
variances were determined based upon an analysis of manufacturing overhead at planned production capacity versus actual product manufactured during the prior twelve month period 
our policy has always been to expense manufacturing variances 
in  these variances totaled approximately million and have been charged to cost of products sold 
to improve utilization in  we relocated our salem  new hampshire laminated cable business to methuen 
in  a reduction in force eliminated approximately employees  primarily in the united states  through proactive cost controls  improved operational efficiency and reduced manufacturing volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues in the prior year 
the decreases were primarily the result of continued cost controls mandated by current economic conditions 
these reductions however  were partially offset by an investment in a new corporate sales organization with a regional focus replacing a sales force that was directly aligned with each manufacturing operation 
more experienced sales staff coupled with a twenty percent increase in headcount has resulted in approximately  per quarter increase in selling expense 
interest income 
interest income was  in and  in and primarily consists of interest income on short term investments 
the reduction in interest income is due to lower average investment balances and to lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was  in and  in the interest expense represents interest incurred on our short and long term borrowings for working capital needs and interest expense associated with deferred compensation 
the increase in is due to higher average borrowing levels 
non operating income 
non operating income was  in and  in non operating income in primarily represents currency exchange rate gains 
non operating income in primarily consists of  received from the settlement of legal claims against a general contractor who constructed an addition to the methuen facility 
we filed a lawsuit against the general contractor and received the sum of  as a settlement  which was recorded when the payment was received 
non operating expense 
non operating expense was  in and  in other expense primarily represents currency exchange rate losses 
our loss before income taxes and the minority interest in parlex shanghai  was million in compared to million in income taxes 
our effective tax rate benefit was approximately in and in the decrease in the effective tax benefit resulted from the net operating losses generated in lower tax jurisdictions and a decreased amount of available tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
net cash provided by operations during was  net losses of million adjusted for non cash items depreciation  deferred income taxes  amortization  loss on sales of assets and minority interest used million of operating cash 
this was offset by million generated from a reduction in our working capital requirements 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in on june   we entered into a sale leaseback of our subsidiary s manufacturing facility in cranston  rhode island the poly flex facility 
we received net proceeds of approximately million in connection with the sale and agreed to lease the facility back for years with options to extend the lease for two additional year periods see sale and leaseback transactions below for more information 
approximately million were used to purchase capital equipment primarily relating to equipment necessary to complete our smart card production line for infineon in china 
cash used for financing activities was million during  and represented bank borrowings and proceeds received from the sale leaseback of the methuen facility  offset by repayments on our bank debt 
on june   we replaced our fleet bank line of credit with a two year  million loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
this transaction was completed in conjunction with the sale and leaseback of our methuen facility and poly flex facility 
the proceeds from the sale of the properties were used to pay down the fleet loan 
in addition  on july   we entered into a security purchase agreement to sell million of convertible subordinated notes and related warrants 
net proceeds  after deduction for fees and transaction costs were approximately million 
additional information on the terms of the sale and leaseback transactions  loan and security agreement  and the sale of our convertible subordinated notes and related warrants are detailed below 
sale and leaseback transactions on june   we entered into the following financing transactions the sale and immediate leaseback of our methuen facility  consisting of a  square foot building and the sale and immediate leaseback of poly flex facility  consisting of a  square foot building 
each transaction was entered into with limited liability companies established by taurus new england investments corp  an unrelated third party real estate investment firm

as the repurchase option contained in the lease and the receipt of a promissory note from the buyer provide us with a continuing involvement in the methuen facility  we accounted for the sale leaseback of the methuen facility as a finance transaction

we received net proceeds of approximately million from the transaction  after deduction for approximately  in finders fees and other transaction expenses 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of  payable quarterly in shares of our common stock 
the notes are junior to the indebtedness due to silicon valley bank  shanghai jingling co  ltd 
and the citic ka wah bank limited 
the notes mature on july  as specified in the agreement  we will determine the number of shares of common stock to be issued as payment for the interest by dividing the monetary value of the accrued interest by the then current conversion price  initially at per common share 
interest expense will be recorded quarterly based on the fair value of the common shares issued 
accordingly  interest expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
no principal payments are due until maturity on july  the notes are unsecured 
the notes are convertible immediately by the investors  in whole or in part  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price equal to 
after two years from the date of issuance  we have the right to redeem all  but not less than all  of the notes at of the remaining principal of notes then outstanding  plus all accrued and unpaid interest under certain conditions 
after three years from the date of issuance  the holder of any notes may require us to redeem the notes in whole  but not in part 
such redemption shall be at of the remaining principal of such notes  plus all accrued and unpaid interest 
in the event of a change in control as defined therein  the holder has the option to require that the notes be redeemed in whole but not in part  at of the outstanding unpaid principal amount  plus all unpaid interest accrued 
in connection with the sale of the notes  the investors also received common stock purchase warrants for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on july  the conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits  dividends and certain combinations 
the relative fair value of the warrants on july  was estimated to be approximately  furthermore  the notes contained a beneficial conversion feature representing an effective initial conversion price that was less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock on july  the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature was estimated to be approximately  both the relative fair value of the warrants and the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital and as original issuance discount on the underlying debt 
the original issue discount will be amortized to interest expense over the year life of the notes 
land use rights in july  one of our subsidiaries  parlex interconnect  executed an agreement to sell its land use rights relating to a parcel of land located in the people s republic of china see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximately million 
we received approximately million in cash in august and the balance will be paid at closing 
parlex shanghai term note on august   parlex shanghai entered into a short term bank note  due august   bearing interest at 
amounts outstanding under this short term note total million as of september  the note replaced a similar short term note that terminated on august  payments due under contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at june   adjusted to include the cash commitments associated with the convertible subordinated notes  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations    capital leases  including methuen facility finance obligation      operating leases  including poly flex facility      deferred compensation     convertible sub ordinated notes   total      throughout fiscal  we took a series of steps to reduce operating expenses and to restructure operations  which consisted primarily of reductions in workforce and consolidating manufacturing operations 
moreover  we continue to implement plans to control operating expenses  inventory levels  and capital expenditures as well as plans to manage accounts payable and accounts receivable to enhance cash flows and return to profitability 
our plans include the following actions continuing to consolidate some of our manufacturing facilities  continuing to transfer certain manufacturing processes from our domestic operations to our lower cost international manufacturing operations  particularly those in the people s republic of china  expanding our products in the home appliance  laptop computer  and electronic identification markets  continuing to monitor and reduce selling  general and administrative expenses  and completing sales of non essential assets such as our land use rights in china see note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we are exploring additional and or alternative financing arrangements to partially replace or supplement our financing arrangements currently in place to provide us with long term financing to support our current working capital needs 
we believe that our cash on hand after the above described financing transactions  and cash expected to be generated during fiscal will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating obligations through at least december if we require additional and or alternative external financing to repay or refinance our existing financing obligations or fund our working capital requirements  we believe that we will be able to obtain new external financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such new financing 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions

rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

this statement amends  among others  the classification on the statement of operations for gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt 
previously such gains and losses were reported as extraordinary items  however  the adoption of sfas no 
may require the classification of gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt within income or loss from continuing operations unless the transactions meet the criteria for extrraordinasry treatment as infrequent and unusual as desctibed in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations  reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

this statement supersedes emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
under this statement  a liability for a cost associated with a disposal or exit activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date an entity s commitment to an exit plan as required under eitf on march   the company adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change in the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosures requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees fin no 

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtness of others  which is being superseded 
the company adopted fin no 
on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has disclosed certain inter company loan guarantees in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of sfas nos 
    and fin no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
future adoption of accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
the requirements of this statement apply to an issuers classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments  including those that comprise more than one option or forward contract 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations  but does not expect a material impact 
factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
our future results may differ materially from the current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our business has been  and could continue to be  materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced electronics industry spending on both a domestic and worldwide basis 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected 
we have at times relied upon waivers from our lenders and amendments or modifications to our financing agreements to avoid any acceleration of our debt payments 
in the event we are not in compliance with our financial covenants in the future  we cannot be certain our lenders will continue to grant us future waivers or execute amendments or modifications on terms which are satisfactory to us 
if such waivers are not received  our debt will be immediately callable 
at june   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our principal external financing agreement with silicon valley bank  or our guarantee of million of debt owed by our subsidiary  parlex interconnect  to citic ka wah bank citic  limited  a hong kong bank 
on september   we executed a loan modification agreement the modification agreement with silicon valley bank 
the modification agreement increases the interest rate on borrowings to the bank s prime rate as defined therein plus decreasing to prime plus after one quarter of positive operating income and to prime plus after two quarters of positive net income  respectively and amends the financial covenants 
effective october   citic entered into a supplemental deed with parlex interconnect relating to the citic loan agreement the citic loan agreement amendment  and with us the guarantee agreement amendment 
among other matters  the modification agreement  the citic loan agreement amendment and the guarantee agreement amendment modified certain restrictive financial covenants such as ebitda  current ratio  tangible net worth and total liabilities to tangible net worth 
we are and expect to remain in compliance with all of our financial covenants  as amended 
at june  and during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our prior principal external financing agreement with fleet bank the revolving credit agreement 
on september   we executed a third amendment to the revolving credit agreement  which amended the financial covenants 
following the execution of the third amendment  we were in compliance with the financial covenants at june  the revolving credit agreement was repaid in june with proceeds from two sale leaseback transactions and borrowings under the new loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
the issuance of our shares upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes and upon exercise of outstanding warrants may cause significant dilution to our stockholders and may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
on july   we completed a private placement of our convertible subordinated notes and accompanying warrants in an aggregate subscription amount of million 
the conversion price of the convertible notes and the exercise price of the warrants was per share 
the issuance of our shares upon conversion of the convertible notes  and exercise of the warrants  and their resale by the holders thereof will increase our publicly traded shares 
these re sales could also depress the market price of our common stock 
we will not control whether or when the note and warrant holders elect to convert their shares 
the perceived risk of dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares  which would contribute to a downward movement in the stock price of our common stock 
moreover  the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock 
by increasing the number of shares offered for sale  material amounts of short selling could further contribute to progressive price declines in our common stock 
for additional information relating to the sale of notes and warrants transaction  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sale of our convertible subordinated notes and related warrants our recently completed private placement has substantially increased our indebtedness 
as a result of our recently completed private placement of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  we have substantially increased our indebtedness 
although the convertible notes provide for the payment of interest in shares of our common stock under certain conditions  we cannot guarantee that such conditions shall exist and  in the event they do not exist  interest payments must be made in cash 
the convertible notes may become immediately due and payable in the event of a default by us of certain covenants 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet our obligations under the terms of the convertible notes  or that we will have sufficient funds to repay the convertible notes in the event of a redemption or an event of default 
for additional information relating to this transaction  please see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sale of our convertible subordinated notes and related warrants servicing our existing debt may constrain our future operations 
our ability to satisfy our obligations to pay interest and to repay debt is dependent on our future performance 
our performance depends  in part  on prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
to the extent that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness  that cash flow will not be available to fund our future operations and capital expenditures 
we cannot be sure our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our future capital expenditures and debt service requirements or to fund future operations 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 
our credit agreement imposes restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur debt  pay dividends  sell assets  create liens  make capital expenditures and investments  merge or consolidate  enter into transactions with affiliates  and otherwise enter into certain transactions outside the ordinary course of business 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet certain financial tests 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control 
a breach of any of these covenants or restrictions would result in an event of default under our credit agreement 
upon the occurrence of a breach  the lender under our credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  foreclose on the assets securing our credit agreement and or cease to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have incurred losses in each of the last three years and we may continue to incur losses 
we incurred net losses in the recently completed fiscal year  as well as in fiscal years and we had net losses of million for  million for and million for our operations may not be profitable in the future 
if we cannot obtain additional financing when needed  we may not be able to expand our operations and invest adequately in research and development  which could cause us to lose customers and market share 
the development and manufacturing of flexible interconnects is capital intensive 
to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  expansion of operations and research and development 
we expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund working capital for anticipated growth 
we may need to raise additional funds either through borrowings or further equity financings 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise the required funds when needed  we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and may lose revenue and market share 
our operating results fluctuate and may fail to satisfy the expectations of public market analysts and investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect our results to continue to fluctuate in the future 
our results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the timing and volume of orders from customers  the timing of introductions of and market acceptance of new products  changes in prices of raw materials  variations in production yields and general economic trends 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or exceed the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our quarterly results depend upon a small number of large orders received in each quarter  so the loss of any single large order could harm quarterly results and cause our stock price to drop 
a substantial portion of our sales in any given quarter depends on obtaining a small number of large orders for products to be manufactured and shipped in the same quarter in which the orders are received 
although we attempt to monitor our customers needs  we often have limited knowledge of the magnitude or timing of future orders 
it is difficult for us to reduce spending on short notice on operating expenses such as fixed manufacturing costs  development costs and ongoing customer service 
as a result  a reduction in orders  or even the loss of a single large order  for products to be shipped in any given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly operating results 
this  in turn  could cause our stock price to decline 
because we sell a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would harm our operating results 
historically we have sold a substantial portion of our products to a limited number of customers 
our largest customers based on sales accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the loss of a significant customer or a substantial reduction in orders by any significant customer would cause our revenues to decline and have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to respond effectively to the evolving technological requirements of customers  our products may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers and we may lose revenues and market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities 
we will need to develop and market products that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
there can be no assurance that the materials and processes that we are currently developing will result in commercially viable technological processes  or that there will be commercial applications for these technologies 
in addition  we may not be able to make the capital investments required to develop  acquire or implement new technologies and equipment that are necessary to remain competitive 
if we fail to keep pace with technological change  our products may become less competitive or obsolete and we may lose customers and revenues 
competing technologies may reduce demand for our products 
flexible circuit and laminated cable interconnects provide electrical connections between components in electrical systems and are used as a platform to support the attachment of electronic devices 
while flexible circuits and laminated cables offer several advantages over competing printed circuit board and ceramic hybrid circuit technologies  our customers may consider changing their designs to use these alternative technologies in future applications 
if our customers switch to alternative technologies  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
it is also possible that the flexible interconnect industry could encounter competition from new technologies in the future that render existing flexible interconnect technology less competitive or obsolete 
we are heavily dependent upon certain target markets for domestic manufacturing 
a slowdown in these markets could have a material impact on domestic capacity utilization resulting in lower sales and gross margins 
we manufacture our products in six facilities worldwide  including lower cost offshore locations in china 
however  a significant portion of our manufacturing is still performed domestically 
domestic manufacturing may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to lower cost facilities in asia and other locations 
while historically our competitors in these locations have produced less technologically advanced products  they continue to expand their capabilities 
further  we have targeted markets that have historically sought domestic manufacturing  including the military and aerospace markets 
should we be unsuccessful in maintaining our competitive advantage or should certain target markets also move production to lower cost offshore locations  our domestic sales will decline resulting in significant excess capacity and reduced gross margins 
a significant downturn in any of the sectors in which we sell products could result in a revenue shortfall 
we sell our flexible interconnect products principally to the automotive  telecommunications and networking  diversified electronics  military  home appliance  electronic identification and computer markets 
the worldwide electronics industry has seen a substantial downturn since impacting a number of our target markets 
although we serve a variety of markets to avoid a dependency on any one sector  a significant further downturn in any of these market sectors could cause a material reduction in our revenues  which could be difficult to replace 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers  and any interruption in our primary sources of supply  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
we purchase the bulk of our raw materials  process chemicals and components from a limited number of outside sources 
in fiscal  we purchased approximately of our materials from dupont and northfield acquisition co  doing business as sheldahl  our two largest suppliers 
we operate under tight manufacturing cycles with a limited inventory of raw materials 
as a result  although there are alternative sources of the materials that we purchase from our existing suppliers  any unanticipated interruption in supply from dupont or sheldahl  or any significant increase in the prices of materials  chemicals or components  would have an adverse effect on our short term operating results 
if we acquire additional businesses  these acquisitions will involve financial uncertainties as well as personnel contingencies  and may be risky and difficult to integrate 
we have completed two acquisitions in the past four years and we may acquire additional businesses that could complement or expand our business 
acquired businesses may not generate the revenues or profits that we expect and we may find that they have unknown or undisclosed liabilities 
in addition  if we do make acquisitions  we will face a number of other risks and challenges  including the difficulty of integrating dissimilar operations or assets  potential loss of key employees of the acquired business  assimilation of new employees who may not contribute or perform at the levels we expect  diversion of management time and resources  and additional costs associated with obtaining any necessary financing 
these factors could hamper our ability to receive the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions we may pursue  and could adversely affect our financial condition and our stock price 
the additional expenses and risks related to our existing international operations  as well as any expansion of our global operations  could adversely affect our business 
we own a equity interest in our joint venture in china  parlex shanghai  which manufactures and sells flexible circuits 
we also operate a facility in mexico for use in the finishing  assembly and testing of flexible circuit and laminated cable products 
we have a facility in the united kingdom where we manufacture polymer thick film flexible circuits and polymer thick film flexible circuits with surface mounted components and intend to introduce production of laminated cable within the next year 
we will continue to explore appropriate expansion opportunities as demand for our products increases 
manufacturing and sales operations outside the united states carry a number of risks inherent in international operations  including imposition of governmental controls  regulatory standards and compulsory licensure requirements  compliance with a wide variety of foreign and us import and export laws  currency fluctuations  unexpected changes in trade restrictions  tariffs and barriers  political and economic instability  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  difficulties in administering business overseas  labor union issues  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
although these issues have not materially impacted our revenues or operations to date  we cannot guarantee that they will not impact our revenues or operations in the future 
international expansion may require significant management attention  which could negatively affect our business 
we may also incur significant costs to expand our existing international operations or enter new international markets  which could increase operating costs and reduce our profitability 
we face significant competition  which could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
we face competition worldwide in the flexible interconnect market from a number of foreign and domestic providers  as well as from alternative technologies such as rigid printed circuits 
many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources 
new competitors could also enter our markets 
our competitors may be able to duplicate our strategies  or they may develop enhancements to  or future generations of  products that could offer price or performance features that are superior to our products 
competitive pressures could also necessitate price reductions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  some of our competitors are based in foreign countries and have cost structures and prices based on foreign currencies 
accordingly  currency fluctuations could cause our dollar priced products to be less competitive than our competitors products priced in other currencies 
we will need to make a continued high level of investment in product research and development and research  sales and marketing and ongoing customer service and support in order to remain competitive 
we may not have sufficient resources to be able to make these investments 
moreover  we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain our competitive position in the flexible interconnect market 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate key personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products and our business may lack strategic direction 
we are dependent upon key members of our management team 
in addition  our future success will depend in large part upon our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such personnel 
we currently maintain a key person life insurance policy in the amount of million on peter j 
murphy 
if we lose the services of mr 
murphy or one or more other key individuals  or are unable to attract additional qualified members of the management team  our ability to implement our business strategy may be impaired 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate qualified technical and sales personnel  we may not be able to develop  sell and support our products 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be harmed and our revenues could be adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret laws and non disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we own patents issued and have patent applications pending in the united states and have several corresponding foreign patent applications pending 
our existing patents may not effectively protect our intellectual property and could be challenged by third parties  and our future patent applications  if any  may not be approved 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our competitors could offer similar products using materials  processes or technologies developed by us  potentially harming our competitive position and our revenues 
if we become involved in a protracted intellectual property dispute  or one with a significant damages award or which requires us to cease selling some of our products  we could be subject to significant liability and the time and attention of our management could be diverted 
although no claims have been asserted against us for infringement of the proprietary rights of others  we may be subject to a claim of infringement in the future 
an intellectual property lawsuit against us  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and could invalidate our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling  or redesign  products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property 
we could also be required to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology 
we might not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our revenues could decline and our expenses could increase 
we may  in the future  be required to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
litigation with respect to patents and other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other aspects of our business 
market prices of technology companies have been highly volatile  and our stock price may be volatile as well 
from time to time the us stock market has experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices for the common stock of technology companies in particular have been extremely volatile 
in the past  broad market fluctuations that have affected the stock price of technology companies have at times been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
if we were to become involved in this type of litigation  we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management s attention  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the costs of complying with existing or future environmental regulations  and of curing any violations of these regulations  could increase our operating expenses and reduce our profitability 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture  use and disposal of chemicals  solid and hazardous waste and other toxic and hazardous materials used to manufacture  or resulting from the process of manufacturing  our products 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing or future laws will be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could be applied to materials  product or activities that have not been subject to regulation previously 
the costs of complying with new or more stringent regulations  or with more vigorous enforcement of these regulations  could be significant 
environmental laws require us to maintain and comply with a number of permits  authorizations and approvals and to maintain and update training programs and safety data regarding materials used in our processes 
violations of these requirements could result in financial penalties and other enforcement actions 
we could also be required to halt one or more portions of our operations until a violation is cured 
although we attempt to operate in compliance with these environmental laws  we may not succeed in this effort at all times 
the costs of curing violations or resolving enforcement actions that might be initiated by government authorities could be substantial 
undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products were to occur by us or our suppliers  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair or replacement costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing  are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our stock is thinly traded 
our stock is thinly traded and you may have difficulty in reselling your shares quickly 
the low trading volume of our common stock is outside of our control  and we cannot guarantee that trading volume will increase in the near future 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock any time in the foreseeable future 
our current financing agreements prohibit the payment of dividends 
the future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings  capital requirements  financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider 
for the foreseeable future  we will use earnings from operations  if any  to finance our growth  and we will not pay dividends to our common stockholders 
you should not rely on an investment in our common stock if you require dividend income 
the only return on your investment in our common stock  if any  would most likely come from any appreciation of our common stock 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
from time to time  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with significant additional taxes  there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we could use preferred stock to resist takeovers  and the issuance of preferred stock may cause additional dilution 
our articles of organization authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock  of which no shares are issued and outstanding 
our articles of organization gives our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock without approval of our stockholders 
we may issue additional shares of preferred stock to raise money to finance our operations 
we may authorize the issuance of the preferred stock in one or more series 
in addition  we may set the terms of preferred stock  including dividend and liquidation preferences  voting rights  conversion privileges  redemption terms  and other privileges and rights of the shares of each authorized series 
the issuance of large blocks of preferred stock could possibly have a dilutive effect to our existing stockholders 
it can also negatively impact our existing stockholders liquidation preferences 
in addition  while we include preferred stock in our capitalization to improve our financial flexibility  we could possibly issue our preferred stock to friendly third parties to preserve control by present management 
this could occur if we become subject to a hostile takeover that could ultimately benefit parlex and parlex s stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in us and foreign interest rates and fluctuations in exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we also have a  loan and security agreement that bears interest at our lender s prime rate plus 
the prime rate is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of june   we have an outstanding balance under our loan and security agreement of  we have the option to repay borrowings at anytime without penalty and therefore believe that our market risk is not material
