the  sf property was originally acquired in and renovated most recently in with the addition of a freestanding walgreen s store 
the property was the company s only holding in the state of texas and its sale represented the disposition of a mature property in a market not part of the company s current geographic focus 
the sale resulted in a net gain of approximately  which was treated for income tax purposes as a reclassification of a portion of the dividend from ordinary income to capital gain 
the net cash proceeds from the sale were used to reduce floating rate bank debt and for general corporate purposes 
interest expense reflected a decrease of  from the prior year due to a combination of lower interest rates and the reduced level of the company s floating rate bank debt as a result of the usage of proceeds from the sale of camelot shopping center and the public common equity offering

this property is subject to a mortgage for which the other owner is liable 
fourteen of the operating properties in the portfolio are currently unencumbered by mortgage debt

holders of the company s series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock are entitled to receive  when  as and if declared by the board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends  preferential cumulative cash dividends at the rate of per annum of the liquidation preference per share equivalent to a fixed annual amount of per share 
dividends on the series b preferred stock will be payable quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of february  may  august and november of each year  or  if not a business day  the next succeeding business day 
the company s current common stock dividend policy is to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders  based upon  among other factors  funds from operations  as opposed to net income 
because funds from operations excludes the deduction of non cash charges  principally depreciation of real estate assets  quarterly dividends will typically be greater than net income and may include a tax deferred return of capital component 
the board of directors  on february   declared a cash dividend with respect to the period october  through december  of per share  to shareholders of record as of february  on january   the company announced that it elected not to renegotiate the economic terms of its lease with kmart in lantana  florida  preferring to re tenant or redevelop the  sf space 
the election by the company was based on management s experience over the years dealing with retail tenants in financial reorganization 
funds from operations real estate industry analysts and the company utilize the concept of funds from operations ffo as an important analytical measure of a reit s financial performance 
the company considers ffo in evaluating its operating results  and its dividend policy is also based  in part  on the concept of ffo 
ffo is defined by the company as net income  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and those items defined as extraordinary under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  certain non recurring charges  plus depreciation on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  nor is it indicative that cash flows are adequate to fund all cash needs  including distributions to shareholders 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
a reconciliation of net income to basic and diluted ffo is presented below year ended december dollars shares dollars shares net income     additions depreciation   partnership depreciation non recurring charge  deductions minority depreciation preferred dividends gain on sale of real estate amortization costs funds from operations available     to common stock interest on convertible debentures   amortization of debenture issuance costs funds from operations diluted     for the year ended december   ffo available to common stock decreased approximately  to million  compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to increased real estate taxes and property insurance costs  as well as the payout of preferred dividends  partially offset by decreased interest expense 
for the year ended december  ffo available to common increased approximately  to million  compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to growth in operating revenues as a result of relatively high occupancy levels coupled with increased apartment rental rates  as well as reduced interest expense 
the growth of operating revenues was partially offset by increases in real estate taxes and property insurance costs 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
certain of our operating leases for retail space contain contingent rent provisions under which tenants are required to pay a percentage of their sales in excess of a specified amount as additional rent 
we defer recognition of percentage rent until those specified targets are met 
real estate investments 
we apply financial accounting standards board statement statement to measure impairment in long lived assets 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded

in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that the liabilities associated with these costs be recorded at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred

the company will adopt the measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of and the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations when adopted 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date

future results this form k and other documents prepared and statements made by the company may contain certain forward looking statements that are subject to risk and uncertainty 
investors and potential investors in the company s securities are cautioned that a number of factors could adversely affect the company and cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including  but not limited to a the inability to lease current or future vacant space in the company s properties  b decisions by tenants and anchor tenants who own their space to close stores at the company s properties  c the inability of tenants to pay rent and other expenses  d tenant financial difficulties  e general economic and world conditions  including threats to the united states homeland from unfriendly factions  f decreases in rental rates available from tenants  g increases in operating costs at the company s properties  h increases in corporate operating costs associated with new regulatory requirements  i lack of availability of financing for acquisition  development and rehabilitation of properties by the company  j possible dispositions of mature properties since the company is continuously engaged in the examination of its various lines of business  k increases in interest rates  l a general economic downturn resulting in lower retail sales and causing downward pressure on occupancies and rents at retail properties  as well as m the adverse tax consequences if the company were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year 
except as required under federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec  we do not have any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements in this form k  whether as a result of new information  future events  changes in assumptions or otherwise 
effects of inflation inflation has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our properties 
substantially all of the company s retail leases contain provisions designed to provide the company with a hedge against inflation 
most of the company s retail leases contain provisions which enable the company to receive percentage rentals based on tenant sales in excess of a stated breakpoint and or provide for periodic increases in minimum rent during the lease term 
the majority of the company s retail leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows the company to adjust rentals to changing market conditions 
in addition  most retail leases require tenants to pay a contribution towards property operating expenses  thereby reducing the company s exposure to higher operating costs caused by inflation 
the company s apartment leases are written for short terms  generally six to twelve months  and are adjusted according to changing market conditions 
these factors reduce the company s exposure to increased cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its bank lines of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures  operations and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows  and to optimize its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objective  the company utilizes its variable libor based  short term one to six month maturities bank credit lines to fund the development and acquisition of new investments until such investments can be financed with long term fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt 
at december   borrowings under the company s bank lines of credit totaled million and bore an average interest rate of 
the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value because they are short term and therefore utilize interest rates which are adjusted to market at maturity 
based on the balance of bank lines of credit outstanding at december  and the average interest rate at year end  each basis point increase in variable interest rates would increase the company s interest expense in by approximately conversely  each basis point decrease in variable interest rates would decrease the company s interest expense in by the same amount 
as the bank lines of credit include those obligations that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and the level of interest rates 
at december   the company had mortgage debt totaling million with an average interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate of this debt will be in  in  in and  and in
