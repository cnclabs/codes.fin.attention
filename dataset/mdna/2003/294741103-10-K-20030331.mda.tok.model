overview the following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of equity office for the years presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this form k 
terms employed herein as defined terms  but without definition  shall have the meaning set forth in the notes to the financial statements

in addition  we recognized approximately million from lease terminations at our unconsolidated joint ventures  including approximately million from one tenant  and received approximately million from ct convertible trust i in connection with the redemption of its non convertible preferred securities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  depreciation and the fair value of financial instruments including derivative instruments  each of which we discuss below 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts rental revenue from our tenants is our principal source of revenue and is recognized in accordance with gaap based on the contractual terms of the leases 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on going basis 
based on this analysis  historical experiences and the current economic environment  we establish provisions  and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the possible inability of our tenants to make required rent payments to us 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded during each period and the bad debt expense is netted against rental revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents the cumulative allowances less write offs of uncollectible rent  is netted against tenant and other receivables and deferred rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the slow down in economic activity  we have experienced over the past two years an increase in the amount of uncollectible receivables relating to tenants in bankruptcy and tenants in financial distress and have increased our bad debt expense and allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
although our historical bad debt expense has been based on the factors described above  if we incorrectly estimate the required allowance for doubtful accounts  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
below is our historical bad debt expense for each of the three years in the period ended december  for the years ended december  dollars in thousands historical results bad debt expense property operating revenues bad debt expense as a percentage of property revenues impairment of long lived assets under gaap  we are required to record at fair value any of our long lived assets that we have determined to be permanently impaired 
our long lived assets consist primarily of our investments in real estate and unconsolidated joint ventures  but we also have investments in preferred securities and notes receivable 
the fair value of our investments in real estate and unconsolidated joint ventures depends on the future cash flows from operations of the properties or joint ventures over our anticipated holding period 
the fair value of our investments in preferred securities and notes receivable depends on the underlying fair value of the issuer 
in assessing potential impairment for our investments  we consider these factors 
if these factors result in a fair value that is less than our carrying value  an impairment may be recognized if we determine the loss to be permanent 
there were no impairments in during  we recognized an impairment of approximately million on an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture that was subsequently sold 
also during  we recognized an impairment of approximately million on several investments in securities and other investments 
of this amount  securities and other investments with carrying values of million were entirely written off 
if we do not recognize impairments at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts  our consolidated balance sheet may overstate the value of our long lived assets 
depreciation we compute depreciation on our properties using the straight line method based on an estimated useful life of years 
a significant portion of the acquisition cost of each property is allocated to building usually to unless the property is subject to a ground lease in which case of the acquisition cost is allocated to building 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to building and the determination of the useful life are based on management s estimates 
if we do not allocate appropriately to building or we incorrectly estimate the useful life of our properties  our computation of depreciation will not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods 
fair value of financial instruments we are required to determine periodically the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes for disclosure purposes 
in determining the fair value of these financial instruments  we use internally developed models that are based on current market conditions 
for example  in determining the fair value of our mortgage debt and unsecured notes  we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add a credit spread to the quoted yields on federal government debt securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
the credit spread estimate is based on our historical experience in obtaining either secured or unsecured financing and also is affected by current market conditions 
we are also required periodically to adjust the carrying values of interest rate swaps and caps  as well as the underlying hedged liability  if applicable  to its fair value 
in determining the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps  we rely on third party quotations to adjust these instruments  as well as the hedged liability  if applicable  to its fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for variable rate debt  the fair value of total outstanding debt and our forward starting interest rate swaps  see the market risk section 
new accounting policies adopted in effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale 
during  we disposed of properties in various geographical regions consisting of approximately  square feet 
the operating results of these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  included herein 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may   any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods shall be reclassified 
as a result of the adoption  extraordinary losses of  and  for each of the two years in the period ended december   were reclassified to amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment expenses 
accounting policy adopted in effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  which requires a fair value based accounting method for determining compensation expense associated with the issuance of stock options and other equity awards 
we decided to adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
to reflect the cost to the company of issuing stock options and other equity awards to certain individuals in the consolidated financial statements 
we will employ the prospective method for adopting sfas no 
which requires the recognition of compensation expense for stock options and other equity compensation granted on or after january  and to record compensation expense for modifications of stock options and other equity awards that were outstanding as of december  we anticipate recognizing compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively  for both option and share award grants accounted for under sfas no 
these anticipated compensation expense amounts are based on the existing compensation structure for and assumes a similar level of option and share award compensation in future years 
future option and share award compensation is subject to change based on actual option and share award grants in future years and their respective fair values 
compensation expense related to share award grants was previously recognized in accordance with apb no 
the adoption of sfas no 
does not significantly change the amount of compensation expense recognized for share awards 
mergers spieker merger on july   spieker merged into equity office and spieker partnership merged into eop partnership 
the transaction  which was accounted for by the purchase method  valued spieker including the outside interests in spieker partnership at approximately billion  which included transaction costs  the assumption of approximately billion in debt and the issuance of million of equity office preferred shares valued at approximately million 
we paid approximately billion in cash and issued approximately million common shares and eop partnership issued approximately million units to third parties  each valued at per common share unit 
equity office financed the billion cash portion of the purchase price using a combination of available cash and a new billion bridge loan facility that was entered into before the closing of the spieker merger 
the billion bridge loan facility had a term of days and an interest rate based on libor plus basis points 
the billion bridge loan facility was repaid in full with the net proceeds from the issuance of billion of unsecured notes in july and terminated upon repayment 
through the spieker merger  we acquired office properties comprising approximately million square feet  industrial properties comprising approximately million square feet and several development properties which added to our ownership in key markets across the western united states 
cornerstone merger on june   cornerstone merged into equity office and cornerstone partnership merged into eop partnership 
the transaction  which was accounted for by the purchase method  valued cornerstone including the outside interests in cornerstone partnership at approximately billion  which included transaction costs  the assumption of approximately billion in debt  the redemption of million shares of cornerstone preferred stock valued at per share  including accrued but unpaid dividends for a total of approximately million  the redemption of approximately million shares of cornerstone common stock valued at per share for a total of approximately billion  the issuance of approximately million common shares and the issuance by eop partnership of approximately million units each valued at per common share unit 
we financed the billion in cash from credit facilities available to us when the cornerstone merger closed 
results of operations trends in property operating revenues income is received primarily from rental revenue from the office properties  including reimbursements from tenants for certain operating costs and from parking revenue from office properties 
as a result of the current slowdown in economic activity  there has been a decrease in our occupancy rates and a general decline in overall market rental rates for our office properties 
below is a summary of our leasing activity for leases commencing in in our top markets  top markets and our total portfolio for our office properties 
our top markets in terms of square footage in order from greatest to least are boston  chicago  san francisco  seattle  san jose  atlanta  los angeles  orange county  washington  dc and new york 
office property data top markets top markets total portfolio for the year ended december  portion of total portfolio based on square feet at end of year occupancy at end of year gross square footage leased during the year weighted average annual base rent per square foot leased during the year calculated in accordance with gaap but without regard to estimated expense reimbursements from tenants a for the year ended december  portion of total portfolio based on square feet at end of year occupancy at end of year gross square footage leased during the year weighted average annual base rent per square foot leased during the year calculated in accordance with gaap but without regard to estimated expense reimbursements from tenants a a average annual rent per square foot for new office leases for which the tenants have occupied the space during the relevant period may lag behind market because leasing decisions typically are made anywhere from one month to or more months prior to taking occupancy 
one of the main factors contributing to the decline in occupancy for our office properties was the increased level of early lease terminations 
for the year ended december   we had approximately million square feet of early lease terminations and received lease termination fees on a portion of the terminations of approximately million 
future rental income may be affected by future lease terminations as we may be unable to collect the full amount that was due under the lease and would incur additional cost in re leasing the space 
although there is no way of predicting future lease terminations  we currently anticipate they will be significantly lower in as mentioned above  there has been a general decline in the overall market rates for our office properties 
as of december   the average annual total rent  including base rent and estimated expense reimbursements from tenants  per occupied square foot under existing leases for our office properties was approximately see item properties property statistics 
the weighted average annual base rent per square foot calculated in accordance with gaap but without regard to estimated expense reimbursements from tenants on leases executed during was approximately 
if this declining trend in market rates continues  we would experience a decrease in rental revenues if the average annual contractual rent per square foot on leases expiring is greater than the average annual market rent per square foot on new leases executed 
as of december   approximately  occupied square feet approximately of the occupied office square feet is expiring through the average annual rent per square foot for these leases is presented in the table below 
average annual total rent  including base rent and tenant reimbursements  square feet of per occupied year expiring leases square foot a total a see item properties for an explanation of how these amounts are calculated 
we believe that it is not currently possible to draw any conclusions about where occupancy levels or market rents ultimately will stabilize 
further decreases in occupancy rates and or declines in rents could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in subsequent periods 
we estimate that each one percent change in weighted average occupancy for our office properties can equate to a million to million change in rental revenue 
in addition to the downward trends in occupancy and market rents  we have experienced an increase in the amount of uncollectible receivables relating to tenants in bankruptcy and tenants that are having financial difficulties 
for the years ended december   and  bad debt expense was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
although we have collateral from many of our tenants  we anticipate additional write offs to occur in subsequent periods 
trends in property operating expenses increased costs due to terrorism threat as a result of the terrorist acts on september   we have realized increased costs for property insurance and safety and security 
we believe that these increased costs will remain higher than similar costs incurred in previous periods for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of the office leases require the tenant to pay  as additional rent  a portion of any increases in these operating expenses over a base amount 
we believe a significant portion of any increase in these operating expenses will be offset by expense reimbursements from tenants 
in addition to the increased cost for property insurance described above  the insurance coverage provided through third party insurance carriers is subject to coverage limitations 
should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur  we could lose all or a portion of our investment in  and anticipated cash flows from  one or more of the properties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third party insurance carriers will be able to maintain reinsurance sufficient to cover any losses that may be incurred 
a description of our insurance coverage is described in
