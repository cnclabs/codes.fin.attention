a item and a management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview the company s business is affected by the factors outlined below which should be considered in reviewing the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company for the periods described herein 
inflation and devaluation of the peruvian new sol the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
a portion of the company s operating costs are denominated in peruvian new soles 
since the revenues of the company are primarily denominated in us dollars  when inflation in peru is not offset by a corresponding devaluation of the new sol  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company could be adversely affected 
the value of the net assets of the company denominated in new soles can be affected by devaluation of the new sol 
the recent inflation and devaluation rates are as follows years ended december  peruvian inflation deflation rate new sol dollar revaluation devaluation rate peruvian branch the consolidated financial statements included herein are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the peruvian branch consists of substantially all the assets and liabilities of southern peru associated with its copper operations in the republic of peru 
the branch is registered with the peruvian government as a branch of a foreign mining company 
the results of the branch are consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
for peruvian reporting purposes  the branch maintains its books of account in new soles and prepares financial information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in peru peruvian gaap 
peruvian gaap requires the inclusion in the financial statements of the branch of the resultado por exposici n a la inflaci n result of exposure to inflation  which seeks to account for the effects of inflation by adjusting the value of non monetary assets and liabilities and equity by a factor corresponding to wholesale price inflation rates during the period covered by the financial statements 
monetary assets and liabilities are not so adjusted 
expansion and modernization program the toquepala concentrator expansion and modernization project was completed in september at a cost of million compared to an approved budget of million 
the project has increased the concentrator s mineral processing capacity from  tons per day to  tons per day  thereby increasing annual production of concentrate by approximately  tons 
the increased concentrate output now gives spcc the ability to fill the ilo smelter without purchasing costly third party material 
the cuajone leaching facility expansion project was completed in april at a cost of million compared to an approved budget of million 
the project increased the capacity for soluble copper from tons per day to tons per day 
production in was  tons of copper compared with  tons of copper in in  the company s improvement project at the ilo lime and coquina plant was completed at a cost of million out of an approved budget of million 
lime production capacity was increased from tons per day to tons per day and environmental requirements of the environmental compliance and management program known as pama see explanation of pama under environmental matters on page a for these facilities were satisfied 
a in  the company completed a feasibility study to expand production capacity at the ilo refinery to  tons per year  an increase of  tons per year over current capacity 
the study s results were favorable and will be considered along with the ilo smelter expansion 
feasibility studies to utilize crusher  conveyor belts and spreader technology in toquepala mine dumps concluded in december with a favorable recommendation 
the main purpose is to replace the truck haulage of leachable ore with a crushed ore transport system using conveyor belts up to the dumps where the ore will be placed with spreaders to prepare the dumps for the leaching process 
significant savings of mine operating cost are expected 
in january   the board of directors approved the project with the engineering stage to begin immediately 
the estimated investment for this project is million  with a month estimated time to complete 
a new project for the construction of auxiliary dams at quebrada honda is in process 
it includes the construction of three auxiliary dams which will prevent decanted water of the quebrada honda embankment reservoir from entering the quebrada santallana  these dams will also serve as initial dams in case spcc decides to increase the embankment volume of the quebrada honda dam 
research studies for tailings disposal at toquepala and cuajone are in progress  the objective of these studies is to decrease operating costs with thickened tailings technology and to recover water used in the process 
the recovery and reuse of water will improve production costs and conserve scarce resources 
previous studies at laboratory level have been completed  and a bidding for the second stage  at a pilot plant level is in process 
at december  million have been spent out of an approved budget of million 
the company s pama  approved by the peruvian ministry of energy and mines mem in  provided that the smelter would be modernized in a two phase project  the first phase to be completed by the end of and the second and final phase by january in january the mem approved the modified one phase project to be initiated by the fourth quarter of and completed by december given current economic  political and market conditions  in november  the company submitted a new request to mem to reschedule the smelter modernization timetable and to start the project by the end of  with completion no later than on february   mem communicated its rejection to the company s request to reschedule the smelter modernization timetable  stating that once the company has taken effective action to implement the project and can demonstrate the commencement of the same  spcc would have the right to apply for the rescheduling of the smelter modernization timetable 
also  in march  in a separate regular biannual environmental review process of spcc s mining activities  mem issued a notice to the company demanding compliance with the commitments established in the pama within the next days 
mem s notice orders the company to commence the modernization project and to satisfy the investment requirements of the pama of million within such day period 
according to applicable law  if spcc is not in full compliance with the mem notice  the company will be subject to a first fine that could amount to approximately  subsequent fines subject to a day periods would be based on the shortfall of actual expenditures against expenditures committed under the pama  as modified 
the company does not believe the amount of fines paid will be material to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows in future periods 
the company is confident that it will be able to resolve these issues with mem and has given mem assurances that it intends to comply fully with its commitments under pama 
mem has announced that the closure of the smelter is unlikely 
the company has received proposals from three international construction engineering entities two additional proposals are pending and expected to be received by may and is evaluating these proposals while continuing discussions regarding incentives with the government 
while the company is in the evaluation stage million has been invested in this project through the construction of the project is expected to require to months and to be completed by january  the original deadline imposed by pama 
the cost of the project was previously estimated to exceed million  but has not been finalized pending the evaluation of the new proposals 
metal price sensitivity there is market risk arising from the volatility of copper prices 
assuming that expected metal production and sales are achieved  that tax rates are unchanged  that the number of shares outstanding is unchanged  and giving no effect to hedging programs or changes in the past production  metal price sensitivity factors would indicate the following estimated change in earnings per share resulting from metal price changes in estimates are based on million shares outstanding 
a copper silver molybdenum change in metal price annual change in earnings per share critical accounting policies and estimates the company has discussed the following critical accounting policies with its audit committee 
southern peru copper corporation s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations  as well as quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks  are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires southern peru s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  for the reported period 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  ore reserves  capitalized mine stripping and related estimated mine stripping ratios  the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and litigation and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition substantially all of the company s copper is sold under annual contracts 
revenues derived from product sales are recognized upon the transfer of title of the inventories to customers  which coincides with the shipment of products to customers in satisfaction of orders 
the company believes that allowances for doubtful accounts on product sales is not required as losses from uncollectable accounts receivable from customers have historically been insignificant and the company believes all of its customers have the ability and intent to pay such amounts 
for certain of the company s sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the monthly average proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case for sales of molybdenum products  ranging between one and three months subsequent to the shipment 
in such cases  revenue is recorded at a provisional price at the time of the shipment  based on lme or comex spot prices for copper sales  and the industry trade publication s proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum 
the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
these provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded derivative instrument under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb as amended 
as of december  and  the years in which the company accounted for such embedded derivatives in accordance with the provisions of fasb  the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments  which corresponds to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above  amounted to million and million  respectively  and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
the effect of applying this method of accounting to provisionally priced sales for the year ended december   would not have a material effect on net earnings for that year 
ore reserves southern peru periodically reevaluates estimates of its ore reserves  which represent the company s estimate as to the amount of unmined copper remaining in its existing mine locations that can be produced and sold at a profit 
such estimates are based on engineering evaluations derived from samples of drill holes and other openings  combined with assumptions about copper market prices and production costs 
the company s current ore reserve estimates utilize a cent per pound copper price assumption and actual production cost data as of the most recent reserves declarations  which were made in for the cuajone mine and in for the toquepala mine 
the a company believes that the copper price assumption it uses is consistent with average historical prices over recent full economic and pricing cycles 
the reserves estimates have been adjusted for actual production since the most recent reserve declarations 
many companies declare their ore reserves on an annual basis 
the company believes that ore reserves determined by its method closely approximates the ore reserve quantities if they were determined as of december  southern peru uses its ore reserve estimates in determining the amount of mine stripping capitalized  units of production amortization of capitalized mine stripping and depletion of mineral land 
as noted above  the company utilized a cent price assumption in determining its ore reserves 
we believe this price reflects a valid price assumption over the remaining lives of our mines  which are years and years for the toquepala and cuajone mines  respectively 
the cent price assumption also approximates the average price of copper over the last ten years the actual ten year average price of copper according to comex is cents 
we understand that the sec has recently stated publicly that in calculating ore reserves  companies should use no more than a three year historical average price 
as of december   the three year average price per pound of copper was cents 
if the company were to have used a price assumption consistent with the average price of copper for the three immediately preceding years in its calculation of ore reserves as of january   reported net capitalized mine stripping and net property  which are non current assets on the company s balance sheet  would have been reduced by million and million  respectively  at december   and on the company s statement of earnings  reported depreciation  amortization and depletion would have been increased by million  and operating income would have been decreased by million for the year ended december  if ore reserves are reduced due to the use of a lower copper price assumption  the company s mined ore grades will improve and tonnages moved will be reduced  consequently the long term production cost outlook will be improved 
the company believes its long term copper price of cents is reasonable and is appropriate for use in managing its operations 
however  the company will implement the sec s directive as of january  mine stripping ratios in carrying out its mining operations  the company is required to remove waste materials to access mineral deposits 
because the concentration of mineral deposits is not evenly distributed throughout the mines  there are periods during the life of the mine where the company mines more or better quality reserves as compared to waste removed  and periods during which the company mines less or lower quality reserves as compared to waste removed 
for each of its existing mines in the production stage  the company s mine engineers have calculated a life of mine stripping ratio which represents the company s estimate of the total amount of waste to be incurred divided by the estimated total proven and probable reserves at each mine 
the mine stripping ratios are used to determine the amount of mine production costs to be charged against earnings 
in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore extracted exceeds the life of mine stripping ratios  the company capitalizes production costs associated with mining operations in proportion to the excess waste mined 
such capitalized costs are included in net capitalized mine stripping  and are amortized using the units of production method 
copper resources contained in piles of leachable materials that have been extracted from the mines are not included in the determination of units of production amortization 
conversely  in periods when the actual ratio of waste to mineral ore mined is less than the life of mine stripping ratios  the company reduces the net capitalized mine stripping asset proportionally with a charge to amortization expense 
during periods the company is stripping at the higher rates  increased mining costs associated with the higher tonnages are incurred 
costs of this nature are necessary in a mining operation to insure the availability of mineable ore in future periods 
the company understands that the sec is currently evaluating methods for accounting for mine stripping costs 
in addition  the company is aware that in recent public comments  the sec has expressed unfavorable views towards the company s method of accounting for mine stripping costs 
however  the company believes that its method of accounting for mine stripping costs  which effectively results in the smoothing of a production costs over the lives of its mines  accurately reflects the results and operations of its mining operations and also facilitates improved matching of revenues and related expenses 
during  and  the company s stripping ratio was higher than the life of mine stripping ratio for both the toquepala and cuajone mines  which resulted in the capitalization of mine costs associated with the additional waste mined 
if the company were to have expensed all production costs associated with its mining operations as incurred  net operating costs expenses would have increased by million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
estimated life of mine stripping ratios for each of the company s mines for the years ended december   and  were as follows life of mine stripping ratio toquepala cuajone the life of mine stripping ratio for both mines decreased for the years and as the company s actual waste stripping for the years and were in excess of the beginning of the periods life of mine stripping ratios  thereby reducing the stripping ratios for the ensuing periods 
this excess stripping of waste was in line with the company s mine plan 
estimated useful lives of assets estimated useful lives of the company s fixed assets are based on periodic evaluation by the company s management and engineers 
changes in such estimates could significantly affect  among other things  the company s operating costs and net income 
during the first quarter of  the company changed the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment to reflect additional information as to historical experience 
this change was accounted for prospectively and resulted in a reduction to depreciation expense of approximately million in litigation and contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal and tax proceedings 
as discussed in note and note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consulting legal and tax counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions of the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings  or when they are resolved in future periods 
a results of operations for the years ended december   and spcc reported net earnings of million  or diluted earnings per share of  compared with net earnings of million  or diluted earnings per share of in and net earnings of million  or diluted earnings per share of in this represents a increase in net earnings in over the prior year 
the increase in net earning in compared with is due to the increase in metal prices for molybdenum and silver  the more important by products of the company  despite a slight decrease in copper prices and volume 
in addition  cost cutting programs  such as the retirement in force program  reduced administrative and production costs in operating break even cost was reduced by cents per pound to cents per pound in from cents per pound in this reduction represents a improvement over in addition  depreciation  amortization and depletion expense decreased million in  principally as a result of a change made in to the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets of the company 
interest expense decreased million in as a significant amount of company debt was prepaid in early interest income also decreased as investable cash was utilized in the debt prepayment 
the decrease in interest income in as compared to was million 
the decrease in net earnings in compared with is primarily a result of lower copper prices  despite higher production and reduced costs 
the average price of copper in on the london metal exchange decreased by cents per pound from cents in to cents per pound in  and comex copper prices decreased by cents per pound from cents in to cents per pound in net sales net sales in were million  compared with million in  an increase in of million 
the increase is principally due to higher molybdenum prices in  which increased net sales by approximately million  reduced by lower copper prices and a million reduction in pounds of copper sold  in part due to a strike in the fourth quarter of which reduced copper production by million pounds 
net sales in were million  compared with million in sales decreased in by million  largely as a result of lower copper prices  which could not be offset by higher sales volumes 
copper sales volumes were million pounds higher in compared with at december   there were million pounds of copper sales recorded at a provisional price of cents per pound 
also the company has recorded million pounds of molybdenum sales at a provisional price of per pound 
prices sales prices for the company s metals are established principally by reference to prices quoted on the london metal exchange lme  the new york commodity exchange comex or published in platt s metals week for dealer oxide mean prices for molybdenum products 
price volume data average metal prices copper per pound lme copper per pound comex molybdenum per pound silver per ounce comex a sales volume in thousands copper pounds molybdenum pounds silver ounces the company s molybdenum production is sold in concentrate form 
volume represents pounds of molybdenum contained in concentrates 
financial instruments hedging activities from time to time  the company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices 
derivative instruments which are designated as hedges must be deemed highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported in current earnings 
copper depending on market fundamentals and other conditions  the company may purchase put options to reduce or eliminate the risk of price declines below the option strike price on a portion of its anticipated future sales 
put options purchased by the company establish a minimum sales price for the production covered by such put options and permit the company to participate in price increases above the option price 
options are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings 
depending upon market conditions  the company may either sell options it holds or exercise the options at maturity 
realized gains or losses from the sale or exercise of options  net of unamortized acquisition costs  are recognized in the period in which the underlying production is sold and are reported as a component of the underlying transaction 
during the years ended december   and the company held no copper put options 
fuel swaps the company may enter into fuel swap agreements to limit the effect of increases in fuel prices on its production cost 
a fuel swap establishes a fixed price for the quantity of fuel covered by the agreement 
fuel swaps are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings 
the difference between the published price for fuel and the price established in the contract for the month covered by the swap is recognized in production costs 
for the year the company entered into fuel swap arrangements for which production costs would have been million higher if this exposure had not been hedged 
the company held no fuel swap arrangements for the years and foreign currency the company selectively uses foreign currency swaps to limit the effects of exchange rate changes on future cash flow obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
a currency swap establishes a fixed dollar cost for a fixed amount of foreign currency required at a future date 
foreign currency swaps are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings 
the difference between the published price for foreign currency and the price established in the contract for the month covered by the swap is recognized as part of the underlying transaction 
during the years ended december  and  the company settled currency swap agreements on a portion of its capital costs contracted in euros for which there was a loss of approximately million and million  respectively 
the company held no currency swap agreements for provisional pricing arrangements for certain of the company s sales of copper and molybdenum products  customers are given the option to select a monthly average lme or comex price as is the case for sales of copper products or the proprietary market price estimate of platt s metals week as is the case of molybdenum products  ranging between one and three months subsequent to the shipment 
in such cases  revenue is a recorded at a provisional price at the time of shipment  based on lme comex spot prices for copper sales  and the platt s proprietary market price estimate for molybdenum 
the provisionally priced sales are adjusted to reflect spot prices at the end of each month until a final adjustment is made to the price of the shipments upon settlement with our customers pursuant to the terms of the contract 
these provisional pricing arrangements are accounted for as an embedded derivate instrument under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb as amended 
as of december  and  the years in which the company accounted for such embedded derivatives in accordance with the provisions of fasb  the estimated fair values of these embedded derivative instruments  which correspond to the month end provisional pricing adjustments noted above  are summarized below  and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheets 
the effects of applying this method of accounting to provisionally priced sales for the year ended december   would not have had a material effect on net earnings for that year 
cost of sales cost of sales was million in  million in and million in the decrease of million in includes the lower volume of copper processed and sold from purchased concentrates  and the lower cost of company mined copper as a result of a decrease in volume sold and lower operating costs 
the increase of million in was principally due to the higher cost of copper processed and sold from purchased concentrates  and the higher cost of company mined copper as a result of the increase in volume sold and fuel cost 
administrative and other administrative and other expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease of million in and million in were principally due to lower legal and other professional fees  and other administrative expenses 
other expenses depreciation  amortization and depletion expense was million in  compared with million in  and million in the decrease in was mainly due to a change made to the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets  this reduced depreciation expense in by million 
this decrease was somewhat offset by an adjustment to fixed assets which resulted in a million pre tax charge to depreciation  such adjustment resulted from an analysis of fixed assets which identified this difference 
extraordinary loss an extraordinary loss of million was recorded in a penalty of million was paid in connection with the prepayment made in february of the balance of the million secured export notes 
in addition  an unamortized balance of million of deferred commissions was expensed in these costs are presented as an extraordinary loss on the income statement  net of the related income tax benefit of million 
the company decided to incur the penalty in retiring its debt because the penalty offset the present value of the amount of interest that would have been due over the term of the debt 
further  in retiring the debt  the company was then permitted to avail itself of potentially more attractive long term financing in the future 
a prepayment penalty of million was paid in connection with the prepayment made in december of the million credit line facility disbursed in march the unamortized balance of million million net of income tax of commission fee related to this credit line was expensed as an extraordinary item in non operating items interest income was million in compared with million in and million in the decrease in reflects the lower amount of cash invested 
in early  the company used million of its excess cash to prepay long term debt 
a other income was million in  compared with million in and million in other income in  and includes mainly miscellaneous camps  schools and medical services to third parties  and scrap sales 
total interest cost was million in  compared with million in and million in in  and  the company capitalized million  million and million of interest  respectively  related to expenditures for the expansion program 
the decrease in interest expense is due to lower debt levels in and lower interest rates 
in february the company prepaid million of its long term debt 
taxes on income taxes on income were million  million and million for  and  respectively  and include million  million and million of peruvian income taxes  million  million and million for us federal and state taxes for  and  respectively 
us income taxes are primarily attributable to investment income as well as limitations on use of foreign tax credits in determining the alternative minimum tax 
the effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the difference in the effective rate between and  which accounts for an increase in tax expense of approximately million  is primarily due to a million charge to tax expense recorded during  which was identified as the result of an analysis performed by the company to reconcile estimated payments of income taxes to current income tax expenses incurred 
the remaining million increase is attributable primarily to an increase in nondeductible items for peruvian income tax purposes such as foreign exchange translation effects which result from the translation of the financial statements into peruvian currency for peruvian tax reporting purposes 
the difference in the effective rate between and  which accounts for a decrease in income tax expense of approximately million  was due primarily to a decrease in nondeductible items for peruvian income tax purposes during the company obtains income tax credits in peru for value added taxes paid in connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and services employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid expense 
under current peruvian law  the company is entitled to use the credits against its peruvian income tax liability or to receive a refund 
the carrying value of these peruvian tax credits approximates their net realizable value 
minority interest of investment shares minority interest of investment shares was million in  compared with million in and million in the provision for minority interest of investment shares represents an accrual of  and for  and  respectively  of the branch s after tax earnings 
the reduction in the percentage of minority interest of investment shares in was the result of purchases of investment shares by the company 
the acquisition of the investment shares has been accounted for as the purchase of a minority interest 
the excess purchase price over the cost of the shares of million has been allocated to mineral land 
cash flows operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in was principally attributable to million lower cash provided by operating assets and liabilities  partially offset by increase in earnings of million 
cash provided by operating assets and liabilities decreased by million in as compared to this decrease was caused by decreases in the cash flow from accounts receivable of million and from inventories of million 
the decrease was reduced by increased cash flow contributions from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  prepaid taxes of million and other operating assets and liabilities of million 
in the company collected a pending tax drawback from the peruvian government  which enhanced the cash flow from accounts receivable 
a the decrease in was primarily attributable to a decrease in earnings of million  an increase in capitalized mine stripping costs of million and a decrease of million of deferred income taxes partially offset by an increase in cash provided from operating assets and liabilities of million 
cash flows investing activities net cash used for investing activities was million in compared with million in and million in capital expenditures in were million  compared with million in and million in capital expenditures in  and reflect the company s expansion and modernization program 
capital expenditures for the years and were higher than and included expenditures of million and million  respectively  for trucks  shovels and other mine equipment 
in addition  the company expended million in for the expansion of the toquepala sx ew facility 
the company s planned capital expenditures in are estimated to be approximately million  which includes expenditures related to the modernization and expansion of the ilo smelter and the addition and replacement of equipment at toquepala and cuajone 
cash flows financing activities financing activities used cash of million in compared with contributions of million in and million in financing activity in included debt payments of million  including a prepayment of million in the first quarter of  new debt incurred of million  escrow funds of million returned to the company  and spcc paid a penalty of million paid in connection with the debt prepayment 
in addition  the company paid dividends of million to common stockholders and million to holders of investment shares 
the company also purchased investment shares for million 
financing activity in included net debt incurred of million  dividend payments of million  escrow deposits drawdowns of million  and purchases of investment shares of million 
liquidity and capital resources financing in december  the company received authorization from the comisi n nacional supervisora de empresas y valores conasev to increase from million to million the issuance of corporate bonds in the peruvian market 
under this program  on july   the company issued bonds for million at a nominal fixed rate of 
on december  the company issued bonds for an additional million at the same rate  in both cases  with a seven year maturity
