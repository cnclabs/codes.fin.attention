our revenues  which consist of software license revenues and service revenues  totaled million in  million in  and million in license revenues consist of licenses of our software products  which generally are priced based on the number of users or servers 
service revenues consist of professional services consulting  customer support and training 
because we only commenced selling edgextend and directalert in  we have a limited operating history in the data services markets 
we currently expect that sales of our older powertier products will continue to contribute to our revenues  but that sales of our newer edgextend and directalert products will contribute a growing percentage of our revenues over the next several quarters 
we market our software and services primarily through our direct sales organizations in the united states  the united kingdom and germany 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million in  million in  and million in which represented approximately of total revenues for  of total revenues for  and of total revenues for our future success will depend  in part  on our successful development of international markets for our products 
historically  we have received a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to a limited number of customers 
sales of products to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in  and of total revenues in in the future  it is likely that a relatively few large customers could continue to account for a relatively large proportion of our revenues and these customers are likely to differ year to year 
to date  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force  and we will need to continue to hire sales people  including those with expertise in channel sales  in order to meet our sales goals 
in addition  our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and leveraging relationships with independent software vendors  systems integrators  oem partners and other resellers 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statements of position and future implementation guidance relating to these standards or any future standards may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices  and these changes could affect our future revenues and earnings 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
provided guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in the financial statements 
sab no 
outlines basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
since inception  we have incurred substantial research and development costs and have invested heavily in our sales  marketing and professional services organizations to build an infrastructure to support our long term growth strategy 
the total number of our full time employees decreased from as of december  to as of december   representing a decrease of as a result of periodic assessments during the year of efficient staffing requirements 
we have incurred net losses in each quarter since and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we are currently targeting that sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  and general and administrative expenses for will be below spending levels 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
while we are targeting to begin achieving profitability on a quarterly basis in the second half of  we may not achieve it 
our success depends significantly upon broad market acceptance of our recently introduced edgextend and  to a lesser degree  the directalert products 
our performance will also depend on the level of capital spending in our target market of customers and on the growth and widespread adoption of the market for data services and data integration 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring and recognizing revenue 
we recognize license revenues upon shipment of the software if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  an agreement has been executed  the fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of services 
for sales made through distributors  revenue is recognized upon shipment 
distributors have no right of return 
royalty revenues are recognized when the software or services has been delivered  collection is reasonably assured and the fees are determinable 
we recognize revenues from customer training  support and professional services as the services are performed 
we generally recognize support revenues ratably over the term of the support contract 
if support or professional services are included in an arrangement that includes a license agreement  amounts related to support or professional services are allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence for support and professional services is based on the price at which such elements are sold separately  or  when not sold separately  the price established by management having the relevant authority to make such decision 
while more infrequent  arrangements that require significant modification or customization of software are recognized under the completion of contract method 
bad debts 
our bad debt policy requires that we maintain a specific allowance for certain doubtful accounts and a general allowance for the majority of the non specifically reserved accounts 
these allowances provide for estimated losses resulting from the inability or refusal of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze such factors as historical bad debt experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
this analysis requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate further  additional allowances would generally be required resulting in future losses that are not included in our allowances for doubtful accounts at december  purchased technology and intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements and operating results 
accordingly in  we took an impairment charge of  in  we took an impairment charge of million 
stock compensation 
we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no accounting recognition is given to employee stock options granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date 
upon exercise  the net proceeds and any related tax benefit are credited to stockholders equity 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using the alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
income taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required

cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues consists of personnel  contractors and other costs related to the provision of professional services  technical support and training

stock based compensation 
some options granted and common stock issued in the past have been considered to be compensatory  as the estimated fair value of the stock price for accounting purposes was greater than the fair market value of the stock as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant or issuance 
total deferred stock compensation associated with equity transactions as of december  was  net of amortization 
deferred stock compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of these securities 
amortization expense  which is included in operating expenses  was  in and  in we expect to record amortization expense related to these securities of approximately  in provision for income taxes 
since inception  we have incurred net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
as of december   we had million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire through  while the state net operating loss carryforwards expire through the net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes are substantially less than for federal tax purposes  primarily because only of state net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized to offset future state taxable income and because state net operating loss carryforwards generated in earlier years have already expired 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss carryforwards in situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
if we should be acquired or otherwise have an ownership change  as defined in the tax reform act of  our utilization of these carryforwards could be restricted 
as of december   the company also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal credit carryforward expires in  while the state credit carryforward has no expiration 
we have placed a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
if and when we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced

these factors include o our ability to close relatively large sales on schedule  o delays or deferrals of customer orders or deployments  o delays in shipment of scheduled software releases  o shifts in demand for and market acceptance among our various products  including our newer products  edgextend and directalert  and our older powertier product  o introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  o annual or quarterly budget cycles of our customers or prospective customers  o the level of product and price competition in the application server and data management markets  o our lengthy sales cycle  o our success in maintaining our direct sales force and expanding indirect distribution channels  o the mix of direct sales versus indirect distribution channel sales  o the possible loss of sales people  o the mix of products and services licensed or sold  o the mix of domestic and international sales  and o our success in penetrating international markets and general economic conditions in these markets 
the typical sales cycle of our products is long and unpredictable  and is affected by seasonal fluctuations as a result of our customers fiscal year budgeting cycles and slow summer purchasing patterns in europe 
we typically receive a substantial portion of our orders in the last two weeks of each quarter because our customers often delay purchases of our products to the end of the quarter to gain price concessions 
because a substantial portion of our costs are relatively fixed and based on anticipated revenues  a failure to book an expected order in a given quarter would not be offset by a corresponding reduction in costs and could adversely affect our operating results 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our business primarily through the sale of unregistered common stock in the amount of million in november  our initial public offering of common stock in june  which totaled million in aggregate net proceeds and private sales of convertible preferred stock  which totaled million in aggregate net proceeds 
we have also financed our business through an equipment related loan in the maximum principal amount of  which has been repaid in full  a second equipment related loan in the amount of  and a third equipment related loan in the amount of  and capitalized leases 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for in and  cash used in operating activities was million and million respectively 
for  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities 
this provision of operating cash was offset primarily by net losses and a decrease in accounts payable 
for each of and  cash used for operating activities was attributable primarily to net operating losses 
these losses were offset in part by depreciation and amortization expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was  for net cash provided by investing activities was million for  and net cash used in investing activities was  for for  cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the purchase of property and equipment and the acquisition of purchased intangibles 
for  cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of the sale of short term investments 
for  cash used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment and purchased intangibles  offset by the sale of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for net cash used in financing activities was  for net cash provided by financing activities was million for net cash provided by financing activities during consisted primarily of the sale of unregistered common stock and stock warrants to an investor offset by repayments under loan agreements 
net cash used in financing activities during consisted primarily of repayments of capital leases and loan agreements offset by the sale of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during was primarily attributable to the sale of common stock 
for and  net cash was also provided from borrowings under an equipment financing facility  offset by repayments of loan agreements 
we have credit facilities with comerica bank 
under those credit facilities  we had a million revolving line of credit facility at december  that was renegotiated in the amount of million in march and is available until april  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we also have a  equipment term loan  and a  equipment term loan 
as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit facility 
as of december  we had  outstanding under the  equipment term loan 
we are required to make principal payments of  per month  plus interest at the bank s base rate plus per annum payable in monthly installments 
as of december  we had  outstanding under an equipment facility 
under this facility  borrowings outstanding of  as of january  converted to an month term loan with principal payments of  per month beginning on february  plus interest at the bank s base rate plus per annum 
the bank s credit facilities required that as of december  we  among other things  maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million and a minimum quick ratio current assets not including inventory less current liabilities of to as of december   our tangible net worth fell below the minimum tangible net worth ratio then in effect  and the bank waived the event 
in march  we renegotiated our revolving credit facility and a new covenant structure is in place 
the bank s renewed credit facilities require that company  among other things  to maintain certain working capital  tangible net worth and profitability covenants 
we expect to meet these covenants 
borrowings under the facilities are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
currently we have no material commitments for capital expenditures nor do we anticipate a material increase in capital expenditures and lease commitments 
we are currently targeting that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least december   provided that we meet our targets with respect to revenues and accounts receivable collections 
if we experience difficulties in achieving our revenue targets  our cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs 
accordingly  our operating plans could be restricted and our business could be harmed 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business could be jeopardized

this interpretation also incorporates without reconsideration the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superseded 
the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and will be applied prospectively 
additional factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are intended to be the ones that are specific to our company or industry and that we deem to be material  but are not the only ones that we face 
we have a limited operating history in the data services markets 
because we only commenced selling edgextend and directalert in  we have a limited operating history in the data services markets 
we thus face the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in early stages of development  particularly companies in the rapidly changing software industry 
these risks include o the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures by our customers and prospective customers  o our need to achieve market acceptance for our new product introductions  including  directalert and edgextend  o our dependence for revenue from our powertier product  which was first introduced in and has achieved only limited market acceptance  o our need to expand our distribution capability through various sales channels  including a direct sales organization  original equipment manufacturers  third party distributors  independent software vendors and systems integrators  o our unproven ability to anticipate and respond to technological and competitive developments in the rapidly changing market for dynamic data management  o our unproven ability to compete in a highly competitive market  o the decline in spending levels in the software infrastructure market  o our dependence on the java programming language  commonly known as jee  becoming a widely accepted standard in the transactional application server market  and o our dependence upon key personnel 
because we have a history of losses and negative cash flow  we may not become or remain profitable 
we may not achieve our targeted revenues  and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we have incurred net losses each year since in particular  we incurred losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
while we are currently targeting decreases in sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses for  as compared to the levels of those expenses in  we will still need to achieve our revenue targets in order to preserve cash 
because our product markets are new and evolving  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate  if any  or the ultimate size of the markets for our products 
we have financed our business through the sale of stock and not through cash generated by our operations 
since inception  we have generally had negative cash flow from operations 
to date  we have financed our business primarily through sales of common stock and convertible preferred stock and not through cash generated by our operations 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations for the year ending december  we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
we are currently targeting that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through at least december  provided that we meet our targets with respect to revenues and accounts receivable collections 
if we experience difficulties in achieving our revenue targets  our cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs 
accordingly  our operating plans could be restricted and our business could be harmed 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our business could be jeopardized 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in prior years  we have often experienced an absolute decline in revenues from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of the next year 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
the factors that may cause fluctuations of our operating results include the following o our ability to close relatively large sales on schedule  o delays or deferrals of customer orders or deployments  o delays in shipment of scheduled software releases  o shifts in demand for and market acceptance among our various products  including our newer products  edgextend and directalert  and our older powertier product  o introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  o annual or quarterly budget cycles of our customers or prospective customers  o the level of product and price competition in the application server and data management markets  o our lengthy sales cycle  o our success in maintaining our direct sales force and expanding indirect distribution channels  o the mix of direct sales versus indirect distribution channel sales  o the possible loss of sales people  o the mix of products and services licensed or sold  o the mix of domestic and international sales  and o our success in penetrating international markets and general economic conditions in these markets 
we typically receive a substantial portion of our orders in the last two weeks of each fiscal quarter because our customers often delay purchases of our products to the end of the quarter to gain price concessions 
also  we tend to experience slower sales patterns in europe in the third quarter 
because a substantial portion of our costs are relatively fixed and based on anticipated revenues  a failure to book an expected order in a given quarter would not be offset by a corresponding reduction in costs and could adversely affect our operating results 
our sales cycle is long  unpredictable and subject to seasonal fluctuations  so it is difficult to forecast our revenues 
any delay in sales of our products or services could cause our quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
the typical sales cycle of our products is long and unpredictable and requires both a significant capital investment decision by our customers and our education of prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
our sales cycle is generally between three and nine months 
a successful sales cycle typically includes presentations to both business and technical decision makers  as well as a limited pilot program to establish a technical fit 
our products typically are purchased as part of a significant enhancement to a customer s information technology system 
the implementation of our products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers 
accordingly  a purchase decision for a potential customer typically requires the approval of several senior decision makers 
our sales cycle is affected by the business conditions of each prospective customer  as well as the overall economic climate for technology related capital expenditures 
due to the relative importance of many of our product sales  a lost or delayed sale could adversely affect our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycle is affected by seasonal fluctuations as a result of our customers fiscal year budgeting cycles and slow summer purchasing patterns in europe 
we depend on a relatively small number of significant customers  and the loss of one or more of these customers could result in a decrease in our revenues 
historically  we have received a substantial portion of our revenues from product sales to a limited number of customers 
in addition  the identity of our top five customers has changed from year to year 
in the year ended december   sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
sales to cablevision accounted for of total revenues and sales to salomon smith barney accounted for of total revenues 
in the year ended december   sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
sales to salomon smith barney accounted for of total revenues and sales to cablevision accounted for of total revenues 
in year ended december   sales to salomon smith barney accounted for of total revenues and sales to our top five customers accounted for of total revenues 
if we lose a significant customer  or fail to increase product sales to an existing customer as planned  we may not be able to replace the lost revenues with sales to other customers 
in addition  because our marketing strategy is to concentrate on selling products to industry leaders  any loss of a customer could harm our reputation within the industry and make it harder for us to sell our products to other companies in that industry 
the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  one or more significant customers would likely result in a decrease in our revenues 
we are currently targeting that a material portion of our revenues will be derived from sales of our newest product  edgextend  however there are technical and market risks associated with new products 
sales of our edgextend products currently represent a material percentage of our revenues 
new products  like edgextend  often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced 
any errors or defects could be serious or difficult to correct and could result in a delay of product release or adoption resulting in lost revenues or a delay in gaining market share  which could harm our revenues and reputation 
in addition  market adoption is often slower for newer products  like edgextend  than for existing products 
because we are focusing our marketing and sales efforts on our newer edgextend data management product  any failure in market adoption of this product could affect our business 
because our products provide additional features to successful application server products from ibm and bea  they may add these features to a future version of their product  reducing the need for our products 
because ibm and bea control the development schedule and feature set of their products  we need to maintain a good working relationship with ibm and bea if we decide to develop future versions of edgextend for those new versions of websphere and weblogic 
failure to develop future versions compatible with the latest versions from ibm and bea could greatly reduce market acceptance for our products 
ibm or bea could add features to their products  which would reduce or eliminate the need for our products  which could harm our business 
they could develop their products in a more proprietary way to favor their own products  or as those offered by a third party  which could make it much harder for us to compete in the jee software market 
we depend on the java programming language  the enterprise javabeans standard and the java enterprise edition jee standard and distributed object computing  and if these technologies fail to gain acceptance  our business could suffer 
we are focusing our marketing efforts on our edgextend products  which are based on three technologies  which have not been widely adopted by a large number of companies 
these three technologies are a distributed object computing architecture  sun microsystems java programming language and jee 
distributed object computing combines the use of software modules  or objects  communicating across a computer network to software applications  such as our edgextend products 
our products depend upon and conform to the ejb standard 
sun microsystems released the ejb standard in  and thus far ejb has had limited market acceptance 
ejb is a part of the jee standard  jee is the java programming standard for use in an application server 
since most of our products depend upon the specialized jee and ejb standards  we face a limited market compared to competitors who may offer application servers based on more widely accepted standards  including the java programming language 
we expect a material portion of our future revenues will come from sales of products based on the jee standard 
thus  our success depends significantly upon broad market acceptance of distributed object computing in general  and java application servers in particular 
if jee and ejb does not become a widespread programming standard for application servers  our revenues and business could suffer 
if we do not deliver products that meet rapidly changing technology standards and customer demands  we will lose market share to our competitors 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  dynamic customer demands and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
customer requirements for products can change rapidly as a result of innovation in software applications and hardware configurations and the emergence or adoption of new industry standards  including internet technology standards 
we may need to increase our research and development investment over our current targeted spending levels to maintain our technological leadership 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products and to continue to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with competitive product introductions and technological developments 
for example  as sun microsystems introduces new jee specifications  we may need to introduce new versions of edgextend designed to support these new specifications to remain competitive 
if ibm or bea introduce new versions of websphere and weblogic  we may need to introduce new versions of edgextend designed to support these new versions 
if we do not bring enhancements and new versions of our products to market in a timely manner  our market share and revenues could decrease and our reputation could suffer 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer needs  or if there are any significant delays in product development or introduction  our revenues and business could suffer 
our edgextend for websphere product was released in march  our edgextend for weblogic product was released in august and our edgextend for 
net product was released in october any delays in releasing future enhancements to these products or new products on a generally available basis may materially effect our future revenues 
because our direct sales team is currently our most critical sales channel  any failure to maintain and train this team may result in lower revenues 
we must maintain a strong direct sales team to generate revenues 
in the last several years  we have experienced significant turnover in our sales team 
in the past  newly hired employees have required training and approximately six to nine months experience to achieve full productivity 
like many companies in the software industry  we are likely to continue to experience turnover in our sales force and we may not be able to hire enough qualified individuals in the future 
as a result of our employee turnover  a number of our sales people are relatively new and we may not meet our sales goals 
in addition  our recently hired employees may not become productive 
because our future revenue goals are based on our development of a strong sales channel through independent software vendors  systems integrators  oem partners and other resellers  any failure to develop this channel may result in lower revenues 
to date  we have sold our products primarily through our direct sales force  but our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and leveraging relationships with independent software vendors  system integrators  oem partners and third parties 
it may be difficult for us to establish these relationships  and  even if we establish these relationships  we will then depend on the sales efforts of these third parties 
in addition  because these relationships are nonexclusive  these third parties may choose to sell application servers  data management products or other alternative solutions offered by our competitors  and not our products 
if we fail to successfully build our third party distribution channels or if our third party partners do not perform as expected  our business could be harmed 
because our products are often incorporated into enterprise wide system deployments  any delays in these projects may result in lower revenues 
because our products are often incorporated into multi million dollar enterprise projects  we depend on the successful and timely completion of these large projects to fully deploy our products and achieve our revenue goals 
these enterprise projects often take many years to complete and can be delayed by a variety of factors  including general or industry specific economic downturns  our customers budget constraints  other customer specific delays  problems with other system components or delays caused by the oem  independent software vendors  system integrators or other third party partners who may be managing the system deployment 
if our customers cannot successfully implement large scale deployments  or they determine for any reason that our products cannot accommodate large scale deployments or that our products are not appropriate for widespread use  our business could suffer 
in addition  if an oem  independent software vendors  system integrator or other third party partner fails to complete a project utilizing our product for a customer in a timely manner  our revenues or business reputation could suffer 
because we compete with sun microsystems  who controls the jee application server standard  we face the risk that they may develop this standard to favor their own products 
because sun microsystems controls the jee standard  we need to maintain a good working relationship with sun microsystems as we decide to develop future versions of edgextend  as well as additional products using jee  that will gain market acceptance 
in march  we entered into a license agreement with sun microsystems  pursuant to which we granted sun microsystems rights to manufacture and sell  by itself and not jointly with others  products under a number of our patents  and sun microsystems granted us rights to manufacture and sell  by ourselves and not jointly with others  products under a number of sun microsystems patents 
as a result  sun microsystems may develop and sell some competing products that would  in the absence of this license agreement  infringe our patents 
because sun microsystems controls the jee standard  it could develop the jee standard in a more proprietary way to favor a product offered by its own products  or a third party  which could make it much harder for us to compete in the jee software market 
microsoft has established a competing application server standard  which could diminish the market potential for our products if it gains widespread acceptance 
our primary success has come in the jee market 
microsoft has established a competing standard for distributed computing  
net 
our 
net products are new and unproven in the marketplace 
if this standard gains widespread market acceptance over the jee or corba standards  our business could suffer 
because of microsoft s resources and commanding position with respect to other markets and technologies  microsoft s entry into the application server market may cause our potential customers to delay or change purchasing decisions 
we expect that microsoft s presence in the application server market will increase competitive pressure in this market 
we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have and may face additional competition in the future 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are o performance  including scalability  integrity and availability  o ability to provide a competitive return on investment to the customer  o flexibility  o use of standards based technology eg jee  o ease of integration with customers existing enterprise systems  o ease and speed of implementation  o quality of support and service  o security  o company reputation and perception of viability  and o price 
in the edgextend market  alternative technology is available from a variety of sources 
companies such as versant  gemstone and excelon are middleware vendors that offer alternative data management solutions that directly target edgextend s market 
in addition  many prospective customers may build their own custom solutions 
in the directalert market  alternative approaches are provided by a variety of sources  including the potential for internal development 
company vendors such as spiritsoft  tibco  and ibm provide message oriented middleware software which may evolve into competitive products 
vendors such as webmethods and business objects provide alternative architectures for business intelligence information 
directalert is based on licensed technology  which the company is licensed to distribute on a non exclusive basis 
we continue to sell current and earlier versions of powertier for jee application server to current customers 
our competitors for powertier include both publicly and privately held enterprises  including bea systems weblogic  ibm websphere  oracle oas  secant technologies and sun microsystems sun one application server 
many customers may not be willing to purchase our powertier products because they have already invested heavily in databases and other enterprise software components offered by these competing companies 
many of these competitors have pre existing customer relationships  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition and larger installed bases of customers than we do 
if the markets for infrastructure software for networks and web based products and services do not develop as we currently envision  our business model could fail and our revenues could decline 
our performance and future success will depend on the growth and widespread adoption of the markets for infrastructure software for networks and web based products and services 
if these markets do not develop in the manner we currently envision  our business could be harmed 
moreover  critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  cost  accessibility and quality of network service  remain unresolved and may negatively affect the growth of the internet as a platform for conducting various forms of electronic commerce 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased activity or due to increased government regulation 
our failure to manage our resources could impair our business 
achieving our planned revenue targets and other financial objectives will place significant demands on our management and other resources  in particularly because we must achieve our revenue and product development goals using both fewer people and less money 
our ability to manage our resources effectively will require us to continue to improve our sales process and to train  motivate and manage our employees 
if we are unable to manage our business effectively within our current budget  we may not be able to retain key personnel and the quality of our services and products may suffer 
our business could suffer if we cannot attract and retain the services of key employees 
our future success depends on the ability of our management to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we are substantially dependent upon the continued service of our existing executive personnel  especially christopher t 
keene  our chief executive officer 
we do not have a key person life insurance policy covering mr 
keene or any other officer or key employee 
our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees  particularly sales personnel and software engineers 
if we are not successful in attracting and retaining these skilled employees  our sales and product development efforts would suffer 
in addition  if one or more of our key employees resigns to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of that employee and any resulting loss of existing or potential customers to a competitor could harm our business 
if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
our software products may contain defects or errors  and shipments of our software may be delayed 
complex software products often contain errors or defects  particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released 
our products have in the past contained and may in the future contain errors and defects  which may be serious or difficult to correct and which may cause delays in subsequent product releases 
delays in shipment of scheduled software releases or serious defects or errors could result in lost revenues or a delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation 
we may be sued by our customers for product liability claims as a result of failures in their critical business systems 
because our customers use our products for important business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
they could pursue claims for damages  which  if successful  could result in our having to make substantial payments 
although our purchase agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitation of liability provisions 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if meritless  would likely be time consuming and costly for us to litigate or settle 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from international sales  which could decline as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
our future success will depend  in part  on our successful development of international markets for our products 
approximately of our total revenues came from sales of products and services outside of the united states for the three months ended december   and approximately of our total revenues came from sales of products and services outside of the united states for the year ended december  we expect international revenues to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  almost all of our international revenues have resulted from our direct sales efforts 
in international markets  however  we expect that we will depend more heavily on third party distributors to sell our products in the future 
the success of our international strategy will depend on our ability to develop and maintain productive relationships with these third parties 
the failure to develop key international markets for our products could cause a reduction in our revenues 
additional risks related to our international expansion and operation include o difficulties of staffing  funding and managing foreign operations  o future dependence on the sales efforts of our third party distributors to expand business  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o failure to comply with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and changing regulations  o exposure to political instability  acts of war  terrorism and economic downturns  o failure to localize our products for foreign markets  o restrictions under us law on the export of technologies  o potentially adverse tax consequences  o reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and o currency fluctuations 
the majority of our product sales outside the united states are denominated in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations as a result of our foreign operations 
we are not currently iso compliant  nor are we attempting to meet all foreign technical standards that may apply to our products 
our failure to develop our international sales channel as planned could cause a decline in our revenues 
if we do not protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be impaired 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet the measures we are taking to protect these rights may not be adequate 
if we are not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and services  which could harm our business 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology  but these legal means afford only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources 
we may be sued for patent infringement 
the software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement and the violation of other intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows 
for example  we may be inadvertently infringing a patent of which we are unaware 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be a patent application now pending of which we are unaware  which will cause us to be infringing when it issues in the future 
to address these patent infringement claims  we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on disadvantageous commercial terms 
alternatively  we may be unable to obtain a necessary license 
a successful claim of product infringement against us  and our failure to license the infringed or similar technology  would harm our business 
in addition  any infringement claims  with or without merit  would be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and would divert management attention from administering our core business 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if our current stockholders sell substantial amounts of common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  these sales of common stock could impede our ability to raise funds at an advantageous price  or at all  through the sale of securities 
as of december   we had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
virtually all of our shares  other than shares held by affiliates  are freely tradable 
in addition  shares held by affiliates are tradable  subject to the volume and other restrictions of rule on november  we sold  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate sale price of  and warrants to purchase up to  shares common stock at an exercise price of per share to certain purchasers affiliated with needham capital partners 
in connection with this financing  we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec covering the resale of these shares including the shares issuable on exercise of the warrants on the earlier of i days after the date of this annual report on form k or ii april  we also agreed to file an additional registration statement on the request of the purchasers under certain circumstances 
when the sec declares this s registration statement effective  the needham affiliated purchasers will be able to freely trade these shares in the public market  subject to certain restrictions as a result of their status as an affiliate  which could result in a decrease in the price of our stock 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile  and we have received a notice from nasdaq regarding the possible delisting of our stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock price has been and may continue to be highly volatile  and we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations  as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and the overall volatility of the nasdaq smallcap market 
these fluctuations have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated because an active trading market has not developed for our stock 
thus  investors may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock at a desirable price  or at all 
furthermore  we have received a notice from the nasdaq smallcap market that if our stock does not meet the minimum per share minimum requirement for a day period by june   our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we cannot achieve compliance we expect to receive a formal delisting notice from the nasdaq smallcap market 
we currently intend to seek a nasdaq hearing for appeal if and when we receive such notice of delisting 
the maintenance of our nasdaq smallcap market listing is very important to us 
we intend to take appropriate actions  as necessary  including possibly seeking shareholder approval for a reverse stock split in order to maintain our nasdaq smallcap market listing 
if our efforts in this regard are unsuccessful  our stock would trade on the otc bulletin board 
delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market could negatively impact our reputation and consequently our business 
in addition  the market price of our common stock may rise or fall in the future as a result of many factors  such as o variations in our quarterly results  o announcements of technology innovations by us or our competitors  o introductions of new products by us or our competitors  o acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  o hiring or departure of key personnel  o the gain or loss of a significant customer or order  o changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  o market conditions and expectations regarding capital spending in the software industry and in our customers industries  and o adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry 
the market prices of the common stock of many companies in the software and internet industries have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have often been unrelated to these companies operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
we may in the future be a target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
the antitakeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions may also discourage proxy contests or make it more difficult for stockholders to take corporate action 
these provisions include the following o establishing a classified board in which only a portion of the total board members will be elected at each annual meeting  o authorizing the board to issue preferred stock  o prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  o limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  o prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and o establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could disrupt our business and dilute our stockholders 
as part of our business strategy  we expect to review acquisition prospects that we believe would be advantageous to the development of our business 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway with respect to any major acquisitions of third party technology  we may make acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the future 
if we make any acquisitions  we could take any or all of the following actions  any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and the price of our common stock o issue equity securities that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership  o incur substantial debt  o assume contingent liabilities  or o take substantial charges in connection with the impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets 
acquisitions also entail numerous risks  including o difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  products and personnel with our pre existing business  o unanticipated costs  o diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  o adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  o risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and o potential loss of key employees from either our preexisting business or the acquired organization 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity 
our operating results are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed by ten percent in  our operating results would not have changed materially 
as of december   most of our cash equivalents were invested in money market accounts and  thus  the principal values are not susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
foreign currency fluctuations 
we have certain operating transactions in foreign currencies  and maintain balances that are due or payable in foreign currencies at december  we estimate that a hypothetical ten percent change in foreign currency rates in would not have impacted our financial results of operations materially 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
