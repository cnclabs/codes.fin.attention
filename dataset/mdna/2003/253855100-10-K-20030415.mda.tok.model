digital lightwave undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview digital lightwave  inc provides the global fiber optic communications industry with products and technology used to develop  install  maintain  monitor and manage fiber optic based networks 
telecommunications service providers and equipment manufacturers deploy the company s products to provide quality assurance and ensure optimum performance of advanced optical communications networks and network equipment 
the company s products are sold worldwide to leading and emerging telecommunications service providers  telecommunications equipment manufacturers  equipment leasing companies and international distributors 
the company has insufficient short term resources for the payment of its current liabilities 
various creditors have contacted us in order to demand payment for outstanding liabilities owed to them and some creditors have commenced legal proceedings against the company seeking in excess of an aggregate of million in damages 
we are in discussions with our creditors in order to restructure our outstanding liabilities 
in order to alleviate the company s working capital shortfall  we are attempting to raise additional debt and or equity financing 
we have received a commitment letter from optel  llc  an entity controlled by our principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors  dr 
bryan zwan  for the provision of a million credit facility to be secured by substantially all of the company s assets  which will supplement the million already extended by optel as of april  the closing of the credit facility is subject to the execution of definitive agreements  which will contain appropriate representations  warranties and covenants  in light of the financial condition of the company 
we have engaged raymond james associates  inc to review strategic alternatives for the company 
a judgment for million inclusive of interest and costs was granted against the company during in connection with a dispute with a former employee of the company 
the company has posted a million bond to enable it to appeal the arbitrator s award 
in january  the company paid million into an escrow account for legal fees and interest associated with this action 
a hearing is scheduled for such appeal in april the company s net sales are generated from sales of its products less an estimate for customer returns 
we expect that the average selling price asp of our products will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including market demand  product configuration  potential volume discounts to customers  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements and the introduction of competitive products 
because the cost of goods sold tends to remain relatively stable for any given product  fluctuations in the asp may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of our products have tended to be concentrated with a few major customers and we expect sales will continue to be concentrated with a few major customers in the future 
for the year ended december   one customer  technology rental services  accounted for approximately of total sales 
the company is in litigation with cit technologies corporation  an affiliate of technology rental services  which is expected to have an adverse effect on future sales to this customer 
see item legal proceedings 
the company has not entered into long term agreements or blanket purchase orders for the sale of its products 
it generally obtains purchase orders for immediate shipment 
the company does not expect to carry substantial backlog from quarter to quarter in the future 
our sales during a particular quarter are highly dependent upon orders placed by customers during that quarter 
most of our operating expenses are fixed and cannot be easily reduced in response to decreased revenues 
variations in the timing of revenues could cause significant variations in results of operations from quarter to quarter and result in continuing quarterly losses 
the deferral of any large order from one quarter to another would negatively affect the results of operations for the earlier quarter 
the company must obtain orders during each quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve revenue and profit objectives 
the company continued to incur net operating losses that started in the third quarter of in october  january  november  january and march the company took certain measures to reduce its future operating costs 
these measures included a reduction in force  pay cuts for management and other expense reduction actions 
the company can give no assurance as to whether its revenues will return to previous levels  when it will generate positive cash flows from operations or when it will return to profitability 
business outlook during  our industry continued to experience an economic downturn that was brought on by a significant decrease in network build outs and capital spending by the telecommunications carriers and equipment manufacturers in our customers declining business resulted in a significant decrease in sales of our products 
we do not anticipate a near term recovery of the fiber optic test equipment market and do not expect the overall capital spending by telecommunication carriers and equipment factors will increase during beginning october  we started rescaling our business in response to the current market environment 
specific actions taken thus far include reducing cost 
we have taken steps during  and  to reduce costs 
in october  the company s board of directors approved a reduction in the workforce by employees and consultants across all departments and instituted temporary executive salary reductions of up to 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of million in related to this cost reduction program 
in january  the board of directors approved additional cost reduction initiatives aimed at further reducing operating costs 
these included a second reduction in force of employees and contractors and the outsourcing of manufacturing and production for our nic and naa product lines 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of in november  the board of directors approved a reduction in work force of approximately positions  or approximately of its employment base 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million related to this reduction in the fourth quarter of in january  the board of directors approved additional reductions in workforce of positions  or approximately of the company s employment base 
the company expects to take a restructuring charge of approximately million related to these actions 
in january  the board of directors approved another reduction in workforce of approximately positions  or approximately of the company s employment base 
the company expects to take a restructuring charge of approximately million related to the employment reduction 
in march  we further reduced our workforce by positions 
maintaining market share 
we are focused on maintaining market leadership with our product lines 
we have evaluated our sales efforts to identify opportunities where our account presence can be improved and are working to exploit those opportunities 
subject to resolution of our working capital constraints  we are seeking new applications for our installed product base to be realized with use of new modular add ons and enhancements 
during  we established offices in australia  taiwan  india  singapore  brazil and china 
subsequently  the offices in australia  brazil  taiwan  india and singapore were closed and we intend to utilize independent distributors for future sales in such regions 
we currently have approximately ten international sales and support representatives across europe and china 
we also established channel partners such as independent sales representatives and distributors to complement our sales force 
continuing product development 
we are concentrating on the products and technologies that we believe are most important to our customers 
subject to resolution of our working capital constraints  we plan to introduce enhancements to our product lines to meet growing international needs and global high speed data service requirements 
in  we added three new products to our nic product line  and introduced four new significant product enhancements 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired certain assets related to the optical wavelength management product line the owm line of lightchip  inc  a salem  nh based provider of components and subsystems for optical networks 
we plan to complement the owm line of remote wavelength management solutions for dwdm systems with our own network access agent naa product line for centralized network testing and monitoring 
on november  we acquired certain assets related to the optical test system product line of tektronix the ots line 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into i a license agreement with tektronix pursuant to which tektronix licensed certain intellectual property to digital lightwave related to the ots line  and ii a services agreement with tektronix pursuant to which tektronix shall perform certain manufacturing services for digital lightwave related to the ots line 
revenues for the ots line have been minimal and  since the acquisition  we have terminated all but nine former employees of tektronix  hired in connection with the acquisition 
there can be no assurance that the company will have the resources or personnel necessary to generate revenues from the acquired product lines 
we believe that these new products and product enhancements  strategic partnerships  and third party distribution agreements will further complement our product portfolio and enable us to offer a broader range of products to our global customers 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following accounting policies are critical in that they are important to the portrayal of the company s financial conditions and results and they require difficult  subject and complex judgments that are often the results of estimates that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition and estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  the reserve for uncollectible accounts  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  the impairment for long lived assets  warranty and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue from product sales 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  the company uses a binding purchase order as evidence that a sales arrangement exists 
sales through international distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship with the distributor 
the company either obtains an end user purchase order documenting the order placed with the distributor or proof of delivery to the end user as evidence that a sales arrangement exists 
for demonstration units sold to distributors  the distributor s binding purchase order is evidence of a sales arrangement 
for domestic sales  delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
demonstration units sold to international distributors are considered delivered when the units are delivered to a common carrier 
an allowance is provided for sales returns based on historical experience 
for sales made under an oem arrangement  delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
oem sales are defined as sales of the company products to a third party that will market the products under their brand 
for trade in sales  including both company and competitor products  that have a cash component of greater than of the fair value of the sale  the company recognizes revenue based upon the fair value of what is sold or received  whichever is more readily determinable  if the company has demonstrated the ability to sell its trade in inventory for that particular product class 
otherwise  the company accounts for the trade in sale as a non monetary transaction and follows the guidance found in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions and related interpretations 
revenue and cost of sales are recorded based upon the cash portion of the transaction 
the remaining costs associated with the new units are assigned to the units received on trade 
when the trade in units are resold  revenue is recorded based upon the sales price and cost of goods sold is charged with the value assigned to trade in units from the original transaction 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the price associated with its revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the price is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
standard payment terms for domestic customers are days from the invoice date 
distributor contracts provide standard payment terms of days from the invoice date 
the company does not offer extended payment terms 
the company assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
collateral is not requested from customers 
if it is determined that collection of an accounts receivable is not reasonably assured  the amount of the accounts receivable is deferred and revenue recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured 
most sales arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if a sales arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
sales returns and other allowances  reserve for uncollectible accounts  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  warranty and litigation we make significant judgments and estimates and assumptions in connection with establishing the amount of sales returns and other allowances  the uncollectibility of our account receivables  the amount of excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  warranty costs and the amount of liability related to pending litigation during any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or used different estimates or assumptions for establishing such amounts  it is likely that the amount and timing of our revenue or operating expenses for any period would be materially different 
we estimate the amount of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products to evaluate the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
our estimate for the provision for sales returns and other allowances as of december  was million 
we also estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for uncollectible accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of our estimated reserve for uncollectible accounts of million 
we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory 
we consider many factors when making our estimates  including analyzing current and expected sales trends  the amount of current parts on hand  the current market value of parts on hand and the viability and technical obsolescence of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
our inventory balance was million as of december   net of our estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
we estimate the impairment of long lived assets 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
these events and circumstances include decrease in market price of a long lived asset  change in the manner in which a long lived asset is used  changes in legal factors and a current period operating loss or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating losses or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of long lived assets 
when such an event or changes in circumstance occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we recognize an impairment when the there is an excess of the assets carrying value over the fair value as estimated using a discounted expected future cash flows model 
at december   we estimated our impairment of long lived assets was million 
we estimate the amount of our warranty liability 
we consider many factors when making our estimate  including historical trends  the number of products under warranty  the costs of replacement parts and the expected reliability of our products 
our accrued warranty liability as of december  was approximately million 
we estimate the amount of liability the company may incur as a result of pending litigation 
our estimate of legal liability is uncertain and is based on the size of the outstanding claims and an assessment of the merits of the claims 
we have accrued million for liability resulting from pending litigation as of december  see item legal proceedings for information about legal proceedings commenced during results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales
