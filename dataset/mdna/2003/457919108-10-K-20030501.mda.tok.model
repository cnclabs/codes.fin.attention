item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the trust s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical and involve the most subjective judgments include our estimates and assumptions of future revenue and expenditures used to project cash flows 
future cash flows are used in the valuation calculation of our hotel properties to determine the recoverability or impairment of the carrying amounts in the event management is required to test the asset for recoverability of its carrying value under statement of financial accounting standards no 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows over its estimated remaining life  the trust recognizes an impairment expense to reduce the asset s carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is determined by either the most current third party property appraisal  if available  or the present value of future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset 
our evaluation of future cash flows is based on our historical experience and other factors  including certain economic conditions and committed future bookings 
at january   the trust owned a interest in the hotels through its sole general partner s interest in the partnership 
recent transactions reflecting the trust s current ownership in the partnership include the following on march   the trust purchased million additional general partner units in the partnership for million 
this transaction was fully funded by mr 
wirth who provided an unsecured loan to the trust at interest payable annually beginning march  on september   mr 
wirth assigned his interest in this loan to rare earth financial  llc  an affiliate of mr 
wirth 
a principal payment of  is due on march  and the remaining principal and accrued interest is due on march  on april   the partnership made an unsecured loan to the trust in the amount of million 
annual interest only payments are due on march of each year and are based on a interest rate 
the unpaid principal balance is due at maturity on april  the trust used the proceeds of that loan to purchase million general partner units in the partnership 
the money loaned by the partnership was generated by refinancing the northern phoenix hotel and borrowing an additional million that was secured by a mortgage on that property 
the original mortgage note was restructured to match the terms of the refinanced note  which bears interest at and matures on april  monthly principal and interest payments began on april  as of april   the trust transferred  at historical cost  its interest in the scottsdale property to the partnership approximately million in exchange for million general partner units 
subsequent to the acquisition of the scottsdale property  the trust recorded impairment charges on the property of  and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
subsequent to fiscal year  the trust sold the scottsdale property to an affiliate of mr 
wirth 
as a result of the aforementioned transactions  the trust increased its ownership interest in the partnership from approximately to approximately as of april  other incremental  less material  transactions have contributed to the increase from to the trust s sole general partner s interest in the partnership at january  the expenses of the trust consist primarily of property taxes  insurance  corporate overhead  interest on mortgage debt  professional fees  depreciation of the hotels and hotel operating expenses 
under the terms of its partnership agreement  the partnership is required to reimburse the trust for all such expenses 
accordingly  management believes that a review of the historical performance of the operations of the hotels  particularly with respect to occupancy  average daily rate adr  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms sold  and revenue per available room revpar  calculated as total room revenue divided by number of rooms available  is appropriate for understanding revenue from the percentage leases 
adr increased slightly by to in fiscal year from in fiscal year occupancy increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily as a result of the reduction in available rooms due to the conversion of studio suites into two room executive suites at certain of the properties 
this reduction in the number of suites available also resulted in an increase in revpar of to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the periods indicated for the year ended january  occupancy average daily rate adr revenue per available room revpar no assurance can be given that the trends reflected in this data will continue or that occupancy  adr and revpar will not decrease as a result of changes in national or local economic or hospitality industry conditions

 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
this interpretation requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
this interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  for interests in variable interest entities that were acquired prior to february  while management has not yet completed its evaluation of the requirements of fin  management believes it is reasonably possible the trust will consolidate  or be required to provide certain additional disclosures with respect to  the management company and the licensing corp 
when fin becomes effective 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation outlines disclosure requirements in a guarantor s financial statements relating to any obligations under guarantees for which it may have potential risk or liability  as well as clarifies a guarantor s requirement to recognize a liability for the fair value  at the inception of the guarantee  of an obligation under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  as of the date of this filing  we have not provided any guarantees that would require recognition of liabilities under this interpretation 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this standard is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the provisions of this standard  which primarily relate to the rescission of fasb statement no 
 eliminate the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items unless they are considered unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
these provisions are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  accordingly  we will implement the provisions of sfas beginning in fiscal year at the time of implementation  we will reclassify any gains or losses from debt extinguishments in prior periods as income loss from operations 
we do not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this standard is effective beginning february  we do not expect that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation the trust s revenue is based on the underlying hotel revenue 
therefore  the trust relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and innsuites hotels ability to increase revenue to keep pace with inflation 
operators of hotels in general  and innsuites hotels in particular  can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit innsuites hotels ability to raise rates faster than inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its mortgage notes payable  notes payable to banks  other notes payable and notes and advances payable to related parties 
the proceeds from these loans were used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand the trust s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the trust s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  the trust borrows using fixed rate debt  when possible 
the trust could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
to date  the trust has not entered into any such derivative transactions 
the trust s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair value and other terms required  by year of expected maturity  in order to evaluate the expected cash flow and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
debt type fiscal thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt interest rate available on january  the fair value of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt were determined based on current rates offered for fixed rate debt and variable rate libor debt with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of january  and does not consider those exposures or positions which would arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not represented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the trust s interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during any particular period and future interest rates
