item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving glycoprotein therapeutics using our proprietary technologies 
we are using our glycoadvance tm  glycopegylation tm and glycoconjugation tm technologies to develop improved versions of currently marketed drugs with proven efficacy and to improve therapeutic profiles of glycoproteins in development for our partners 
we expect these next generation proteins to offer significant advantages over drugs that are now on the market  potentially including less frequent dosing and improved safety and efficacy 
in addition to developing our own products or co developing products with others  we expect to enter into strategic partnerships for including our technologies into the product design and manufacturing processes of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
while our primary goal is protein drug development  our technologies offer multiple opportunities to participate in the evolving therapeutic protein market by addressing other challenges  such as manufacturing efficiency  manufacturing consistency  and the use of non mammalian cell expression systems 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect additional losses in and over the next several years as we expand product research and development efforts  increase manufacturing scale up activities and  potentially  begin sales and marketing activities 
application of critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a focuses on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed and adjusted periodically by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note to our financial statements included in item of this form k 
management considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
our history of negative operating cash flows is an indicator of impairment 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s long lived asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the recognized impairment would be calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
valuation of acquired intellectual property the carrying value of acquired intellectual property acquired ip on our balance sheet as of december  was million 
as of december  and  our market capitalization exceeded the book value of our net assets by approximately million and million  respectively 
because most of our intellectual property portfolio is not reflected on our balance sheet  we believe the premium to book value reflected in our market capitalization is largely due to the market s valuation of our intellectual property portfolio 
as a result of the decline during in the premium to book value reflected in our market capitalization  we believed it was appropriate to review our acquired intellectual property acquired ip for impairment as of december  since the undiscounted sum of the estimated future cash flows from the acquired ip exceeded the carrying value  we have not recognized an impairment 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment of our acquired ip is a critical accounting estimate because 
the accounting estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to estimate future cash flows over the life of our acquired ip by making assumptions about the timing and probability of our success in 
entering into new collaborations  and 
developing and commercializing products that incorporate our technologies  either directly or with collaborators  and 
the recognition of an impairment would have a material impact on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our net loss 
management s assumptions underlying the estimate of cash flows require significant judgment because we have limited experience in entering into collaborations with others to develop products incorporating our technologies 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing products incorporating our technologies and we have no experience in commercializing any products 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accouting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this md a 
in estimating the impact of future collaborations  we have made assumptions about the timing of entering into collaborations for potential products  most of which we are not yet developing 
we have used data from public and private sources to estimate the types of cash flows that would occur at various stages of development for each product 
as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  related to acquired ip are greater than the current carrying value of the asset 
any decreases in estimated future cash flows could have an impact on the carrying value of the acquired ip 
if we had determined the acquired ip to be fully impaired as of december   total assets would have been reduced by and net loss would have been increased by 
valuation of property and equipment our property and equipment  which have a carrying value of million as of december   have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of those assets 
approximately million of the carrying value represents the cost and  we believe  the fair value of construction in progress 
we believe the remaining property and equipment carrying value of million does not exceed its fair value 
of the million of carrying value of construction in progress  approximately million  was expended as part of a planned million renovation to a leased facility 
we have suspended plans to complete these renovations and we have not yet made a final decision as to when or if we will resume this project 
to the extent that we determine that the partially completed renovations are of no future use to us  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss in our statement of operations 
if we had determined this asset to be fully impaired as of december   total assets would have been reduced by and net loss would have been increased by 
if we decide to resume the project  we anticipate expending an additional million to restart the project and complete the renovations 
valuation of investment in convertible preferred stock in  we made an investment of approximately million in convertible preferred stock of neuronyx  inc our equity investment  which represents an ownership interest of less than  was made on the same terms as other unaffiliated investors 
accordingly  we recorded and carry our investment at cost 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of this investment and record  if necessary  appropriate impairments in value 
no such impairments have occurred as of december  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and the carrying value of our investment is impaired 
if we had determined this investment to be fully impaired as of december   total assets would have been reduced by and net loss would have been increased by 
revenue recognition our revenue from collaborative agreements consists of up front fees  research and development funding  and milestone payments 
we recognize revenues from these agreements consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement  but the actual performance period may vary 
we adjust the performance periods based on available facts and circumstances 
periodic payments for research and development activities are recognized over the period that we perform those activities under the terms of each agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based on the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract or as a measure of substantive progress towards completion under the contract 
stock based employee compensation we apply apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for all stock based employee compensation 
we record deferred compensation for option grants to employees for the amount  if any  by which the market price per share exceeds the exercise price per share 
we amortize deferred compensation over the vesting periods of each option 
we have elected to adopt only the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the following table illustrates the effect on our net loss and basic and diluted net loss per share if we had recorded compensation expense for the estimated fair value of our stock based employee compensation  consistent with sfas in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net loss as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards    net loss pro forma    basic and diluted net loss per share as reported basic and diluted net loss per share pro forma liquidity and capital resources overview we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of our securities  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december   compared to approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  the decrease for was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operating loss and capital expenditures 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock in a private placement to a group of institutional and individual investors  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash and marketable securities  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through the middle of  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and marketable securities sooner than the above estimate 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including if and when any products manufactured using our technology are commercialized 
during  we focused our business on the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics  which we plan to pursue both independently and in collaboration with selected partners 
this development and commercialization will require substantial investments by us and our collaborators 
most of our revenues were derived from agreements that have been terminated or will conclude early in as a result  our revenues are difficult to project and will be largely dependent on entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations 
other than revenues from any future collaborations  we expect to generate no significant revenues until such time as products incorporating our technologies are commercialized  which is not expected during the next several years 
we expect an additional several years to elapse before we can expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operating and investing requirements 
accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our operations beyond the middle of capital expenditures during   and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of property  equipment  and building improvements 
the improvements during and consisted largely of the two following facility improvement projects 
we completed construction in of a pilot manufacturing facility at our headquarters location for the production of enzymes and sugar nucleotides at commercial scale in accordance with us food and drug administration s good manufacturing practices regulations 
the facility comprises approximately  square feet of processing areas and  square feet of utility space 
it has bacterial and fungal fermentation capabilities and houses two  liter fermenters 
we expended approximately million for this project  of which approximately million and million were expended in and  respectively 

we entered into a lease agreement in for a  square foot building  which we intended to convert into laboratory and office space for an expected cost of approximately million 
later in  we suspended plans to complete these renovations and we have not yet made a final decision as to when or if we will resume this project 
our property and equipment at december  includes approximately million in renovations to this facility 
to the extent that we determine the partially completed renovations are of no future use to us  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss in our statement of operations 
if we decide to resume the project  we anticipate expending an additional million to restart the project and complete the renovations 
in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million to million  which excludes the impact of resuming the facility renovations described above 
we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through the issuance of new debt or equity 
if we issue new debt  we may be required to maintain a minimum cash and investments balance  or to transfer cash into an escrow account to collateralize some portion of the debt  or both 
long term debt montgomery county pennsylvania ida bonds in  we issued  through the montgomery county pennsylvania industrial development authority  million of taxable and tax exempt bonds  of which million remains outstanding as of december  the bonds were issued to finance the purchase of our headquarters building and the construction of a pilot scale manufacturing facility within our building 
the bonds are supported by an aa rated letter of credit  and a reimbursement agreement between our bank and the letter of credit issuer 
the interest rate on the bonds will vary weekly  depending on market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations  respectively 
during  the weighted average  effective interest rate was per year  including letter of credit and other fees 
the terms of the bond issuance provide for monthly  interest only payments and a single repayment of principal at the end of the twenty year life of the bonds 
however  under our agreement with our bank  we are making monthly payments to an escrow account to provide for an annual prepayment of principal 
as of december   we had restricted funds relating to the bonds of approximately million  which consisted of our monthly payments to an escrow account plus interest revenue on the balance of the escrow account 
during  we will be required to make payments of million into the escrow account 
to provide credit support for this arrangement  we have given a first mortgage on the land  building  improvements  and certain machinery and equipment to our bank 
we have also agreed to maintain a minimum required cash and short term investments balance of at least two times the outstanding loan balance 
if we fail to comply with this requirement  we are required to deposit with the lender cash collateral up to  but not more than  the loan s unpaid balance 
at december   we were required to maintain million of cash and short term investments 
equipment loan in december  we borrowed approximately million to finance the purchase of equipment  which is collateralizing the amount borrowed 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
during  we will be required to make payments totalling approximately million under this agreement 
capital lease obligation in november  we entered into a capital lease to lease  of equipment 
the terms of the lease require us to make monthly payments of  over months 
during  we will be required to make payments totalling  under this agreement 
summary of contractual obligations in addition to entering into the equipment lease financing described above  we entered into an operating lease agreement during for a  square foot building in horsham  pennsylvania 
our aggregate rental obligation over the year lease term is approximately million

represents the present value as of december  of the remaining payments under agreements with two former employees 
the agreement relating to one of the employees will terminate in march prior to the termination  the employee may agree to extend his non competition and non solicitation commitments for two additional years by entering into a separate non competition agreement 
if he does so  we will continue his medical benefits for an additional six months  extend his monthly payment of  for additional months  and continue his stock option vesting and exercisability during the additional two year period 
this contingent commitment is not reflected in the above table or on our balance sheet as of december  these agreements are described in note of the notes to financial statements included in this form k 
other factors affecting liquidity wyeth pharmaceuticals in december  we entered into a research  development and license agreement with wyeth pharmaceuticals  a division of wyeth  for the use of our glycoadvance technology to develop an improved production process for wyeth s biopharmaceutical compound  recombinant psgl ig p selectin glycoprotein ligand  which was in phase ii clinical trials 
in may  we learned of wyeth s decision to discontinue the development of rpsgl ig for the treatment of myocardial infarction based on phase ii results 
their decision was unrelated to the performance of our glycoadvance technology  which was to have been incorporated for phase iii and commercial production 
wyeth subsequently notified us of the termination of the agreement  effective september during  we recognized approximately million of revenue from this agreement 
we expect to receive no further revenues from this collaboration 
joint venture with mcneil nutritionals we have a joint venture with mcneil nutritionals to develop bulking agents for use in the food industry 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method  under which we recognize our share of the income and losses of the joint venture 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our initial investment in the joint venture of approximately  to zero to reflect our share of the joint venture s losses 
we recorded this amount as research and development expense in our statements of operations 
we will record our share of post losses of the joint venture  however  only to the extent of our actual or committed investment in the joint venture 
the joint venture developed a process for making fructooligosaccharides and constructed a pilot facility in athens  georgia 
in  the joint venture closed the pilot facility and is exploring establishing a manufacturing arrangement with a third party to produce this or other bulking agents 
as a result  we do not intend to commit the joint venture to make any further investments in facilities 
during the years ended december    and  we supplied to the joint venture research and development services and supplies  which cost approximately million  million  and  respectively  which were reimbursed to us by the joint venture 
these amounts have been reflected as a reduction of research and development expense in our statements of operations 
as of december   the joint venture owed us  we expect to provide fewer research and development services during compared to  thereby reducing our expected reimbursement from the joint venture 
if the joint venture becomes profitable  we will recognize our share of the joint venture s profits only after the amount of our capital contributions to the joint venture is equivalent to our share of the joint venture s accumulated losses 
as of december   the joint venture had an accumulated loss since inception of approximately million 
until the joint venture is profitable  mcneil nutritionals is required to fund  as a non recourse  no interest loan to the joint venture  all of the joint venture s capital expenditures in excess of an agreed upon amount  and all of the joint venture s operating losses 
the loan balance would be repayable by the joint venture to mcneil nutritionals over a seven year period commencing on the earlier of september  or the date on which neose attains a ownership interest in the joint venture after having had a lesser ownership interest 
in the event of any dissolution of the joint venture  the loan balance would be payable to mcneil nutritionals by the joint venture before any distribution of assets to us 
as of december   the joint venture owed mcneil nutritionals approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
results of operations years ended december  and and outlook for our net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to and provides our estimate of trends for for each component 
revenue from collaborative agreements 
revenues from collaborative agreements increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase in revenues during was primarily a result of our wyeth pharmaceuticals collaboration  which was terminated in the third quarter of of the increase  million was non cash  and represented the remaining amortization of the up front fee that wyeth paid in december as required under sab  we deferred the up front fee and began to amortize this amount as revenue over the expected performance period of the wyeth agreement 
upon termination of the wyeth agreement  the unamortized portion of the up front fee was recognized as revenue 
most of our revenues were derived from agreements that have been terminated or will conclude early in as a result  our revenues are difficult to project and are largely dependent on entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increases in the number of employees as well as increased laboratory supplies and service expenses 
in january  we announced the selection of an improved erythropoietin as our first proprietary candidate for development 
we are planning to conduct various preclinical activities during and the first half of  with the goal of beginning clinical trials in the second half of in addition  we intend to generate internal data on other potential proprietary drug candidates  and we expect to announce our second proprietary candidate for development in the second half of as a result of these activities  we expect our research and development expenses to be significantly greater than they were in marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the corresponding period in the period contained higher personnel costs including payroll  recruiting  and relocation  legal  and consulting expenses than the comparable period  which increases resulted primarily from recruiting of senior executives and focusing our business on the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics 
during  we expect our marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase by less than over severance expense 
during the year ended december   we incurred severance expense of approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  of the million incurred in  approximately million is a non cash charge related to stock option modifications for an agreement entered into with one of our officers in connection with his retirement 
we have no current plans to incur severance expenses during other income and expense 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of other income upon receipt from genzyme general of a contract payment  which was due as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with novazyme pharmaceuticals  inc in march in september  genzyme acquired novazyme  and assumed novazyme s contractual obligation to us 
we do not expect to recognize any additional other income during interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  as well as lower interest rates  during our interest income during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we complete any collaborative agreements and any additional equity or debt financings during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december  was zero  compared to  for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to the fact that in we capitalized  of interest expense on our two capital construction projects  as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
in accordance with gaap  we recognized capitalized interest for these projects only to the extent of our actual interest expense  resulting in no reported interest expense for our interest expense during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on prevailing interest rates and whether we complete any additional debt financings  and whether we decide to resume and complete the facility renovations described in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
years ended december  and our net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to revenue from collaborative agreements 
revenues from collaborative agreements decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in substantially all of our revenues during were payments received by us under our collaborative agreement with wyeth nutrition 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new employees in and the expenses associated with our san diego facility  which we began leasing in april in addition  our joint venture with mcneil nutritionals reimbursed neose approximately million in  which was approximately million less than in  for the cost of research and development services and supplies provided to the joint venture 
the reimbursement amounts have been reflected as a reduction of research and development expense in our statements of operations for and marketing  general and administrative expense 
marketing  general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional business development personnel  increased expenses for marketing glycoadvance  and increased legal and filing expenses associated with our growing patent portfolio 
severance expense 
during the year ended december   we incurred severance expense of approximately million  which included non cash charges of approximately million related to stock option modifications in connection with the separation of employees from neose 
other income and expense 
we realized a gain of approximately million in from the sale of shares of genzyme general common stock  which we received as a result of genzyme s acquisition of novazyme pharmaceuticals  inc in september interest income decreased to approximately million in from approximately million in due to lower average cash and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates during interest expense decreased to  in from approximately million in due to lower average loan balances and lower interest rates during recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which was released in august  addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and their associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of intangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  or normal use of the asset 
the enterprise is also required to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset ie the associated asset retirement cost and to depreciate that cost over the life of the asset 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time ie accretion expense and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
because of the extensive use of estimates  most enterprises will record a gain or loss when they settle the obligation 
we are required to adopt sfas for our fiscal year beginning january   we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas amends existing guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary  as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the risk management strategy of many companies 
sfas also amends sfas to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
are applied in fiscal years beginning after may  earlier application of these provisions is encouraged 
the provisions of the statement related to statement no 
were effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
sfas also addresses recognition of certain costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees and termination of benefits provided to employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december   and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december   and are included in the notes to the financial statements included in this form k 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  because we have no involvement with any variable interest entities  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
factors affecting the company s prospects risks related to development stage company if we fail to obtain necessary funds for our operations  we will be unable to maintain and improve our technology position and we will be unable to develop and commercialize our therapeutic proteins 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the public and private placements of debt and equity securities  revenues from corporate collaborations  capital equipment and leasehold financing proceeds  gains from the sale of investments  and interest earned on investments 
we believe that our existing cash and short term investments  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  anticipated financing of capital expenditures  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through the middle of our present and future capital requirements depend on many factors  including 
the level of research and development investment required to develop our therapeutic proteins and improve our technology position  
the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  
the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  
our ability to enter into new agreements with collaborators and to extend our existing collaborations  and the terms of these agreements  
our success rate or that of our collaborators in discovery efforts associated with milestones and royalties  
the timing  willingness  and ability of our collaborators to commercialize products incorporating our technologies  
costs of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  
costs of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
our need or decision to acquire or license complementary technologies or new drug targets  and 
changes in product candidate development plans needed to address any difficulties in clinical studies or in commercialization 
we will require significant amounts of additional capital in the future  and we do not have any assurance that funding will be available when we need it on terms that we find favorable  if at all 
we may seek to raise these funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  credit facilities  or through corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership would be reduced and they may experience substantial dilution 
we may also issue equity securities that provide for rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we enter into a credit facility  the agreement may require us to maintain compliance with financial covenants and restrict our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  make redemptions or repurchases of capital stock  make loans  investments or capital expenditures  or engage in other activities 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  take advantage of opportunities  develop products or technologies  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly delayed or limited  and we may need to downsize or halt our operations 
we have a history of losses  and we may incur continued losses for some time 
we have incurred losses each year  including net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  given our planned level of operating expenses  we expect to continue incurring losses for some time 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have derived substantially all of our revenue from corporate collaborations  license agreements  and investments 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from these sources and from the licensing of our technologies 
we also expect to spend significant amounts to expand our research and development on our proprietary drug candidates and technologies  maintain and expand our intellectual property position  expand our manufacturing scale up activities  and expand our business development and commercialization efforts 
we may continue to incur substantial losses even if our revenues increase 
we have a joint venture with mcneil nutritionals  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
the joint venture has incurred losses since its inception  and we expect that the joint venture will incur additional losses for some time while it explores opportunities to continue the development of this technology 
we have not yet commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never become profitable 
we have not yet developed any products or commercialized any products or technologies  and we may never be able to do so 
since we began operations in  we have not generated any revenues  except for interest income and revenues from collaborative agreements and investments 
we do not know when or if we will complete any of our product development efforts  receive regulatory approval of any of our product candidates  or successfully commercialize any approved products 
even if we should be successful in developing products that are approved for marketing  we will not be successful unless our products  and products incorporating our technologies  gain market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors  including 
the receipt of regulatory approvals for the uses we seek  
the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  and 
pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products or products incorporating our technologies 
as a result  we are unable to predict the extent of future losses or the time required to achieve profitability  if at all 
even if we or our collaborators successfully develop one or more products that incorporate our technologies  we may not become profitable 
risks related to development of products and technologies we have limited product development and commercial manufacturing capability and experience  and we may be unable to develop therapeutic proteins and commercialize our technologies 
until recently  we have not focused on the development of our own proprietary products 
we are now seeking to use our glycoadvance  glycopegylation and glycoconjugation technologies to develop proprietary next generation proteins  generally in collaboration with a partner 
our technologies may not result in the successful remodeling  optimization or development of proteins that are safe or efficacious 
because the development of new pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain  our technologies may not produce any commercially successful proteins 
if we fail to validate our technologies through the successful remodeling of the proteins we select for development  we will not be able to license our next generation drug candidates  and our customers will not be able to develop drug candidates incorporatiing our technologies 
to date  we have manufactured only smaller  noncommercial quantities of our enzymes  sugar nucleotides  and complex carbohydrates 
we intend to manufacture enzymes and sugar nucleotides for use in our proprietary product development programs and for use by our customers 
our success depends on our ability to manufacture these compounds on a commercial scale and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  prescribed by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of the products we develop  even to meet our needs for pre clinical or clinical development  and we may have problems complying  or maintaining compliance  with cgmp 
in addition to the normal scale up risks associated with any manufacturing process  we may face unanticipated problems unique to the manufacture of enzymes  sugar nucleotides  or complex carbohydrates 
if we are unable to develop commercial scale manufacturing capacity  we would seek collaborators  licensees  or contract manufacturers to manufacture the compounds necessary to commercialize our technologies 
we may not be able to find parties willing to manufacture these compounds at acceptable prices 
any manufacturing facility must adhere to the fda s evolving regulations on cgmp  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
the manufacture of products at any facility will be subject to strict quality control  testing  and record keeping requirements  and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post market information 
ultimately  we or our contract manufacturers may not meet these requirements 
if we encounter delays or difficulties in connection with manufacturing  commercialization of our products and technologies could be delayed  or we could breach our obligations under our collaborative agreements 
our success depends on collaborative relationships  and our failure to enter into new collaborations  or to successfully manage our existing and future collaborations and license arrangements  could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and technologies 
we rely to a large extent on collaborative partners to co develop our products and to commercialize products made using our technologies 
this strategy entails many risks  including 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into collaborative agreements for the co development of our products or the commercialization of products incorporating our technologies  
we may not be successful in adapting our technologies to the needs of our collaborative partners  
our collaborators may not be successful in  or may not remain committed to  co developing our products or commercializing products incorporating our technologies  
our collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to incorporating our technologies into their products  
our collaborators may seek to develop proprietary alternatives to our products or technologies  
none of our collaborators is contractually obligated to market or commercialize our products or products incorporating our technologies  nor is any of them contractually required to achieve any specific production schedule  
our collaborative agreements are generally terminable by our partners on short notice  and 
continued consolidation in our target markets may also limit our ability to enter into collaboration agreements  or may result in terminations of existing collaborations 
any of our present or future collaborators may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
in addition  we may dispute the application of payment provisions under any of our collaborative agreements 
if any of these events occur or if we fail to enter into or maintain collaborative agreements  we may not be able to commercialize our products and technologies 
we will be increasingly exposed to business interruption risks 
we are always exposed to the risks of business interruptions at our facilities and those of our collaborators and suppliers 
any interruption of our utility supplies or ability to continue work could delay our business and research activities and may render ongoing work worthless 
as our manufacturing operations increase in importance  and as we scale up the size of our manufacturing batches  we will be increasingly exposed to these risks  any of which could result in significant expense and may result in our inability to comply with our development plans and contractual deadlines 
we may be exposed to product liability and related risks 
the use in humans of compounds developed by us or incorporating our technologies may result in product liability claims 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend  and may result in large settlements of claims or judgments against us 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity  time  and expense involved in defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
risks related to intellectual property the failure to obtain or maintain adequate patents  and other intellectual property protection  could impact our ability to compete effectively 
our commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and developing and maintaining a proprietary position with regard to our own technologies  products and business 
as we seek to develop next generation proprietary products  we will have to investigate the patent protection for our target proteins 
there have been significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patent rights  and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain 
for example  with respect to epo  the target of our first development program  the status of issued patents is currently being litigated and may delay our ability to market epo in the u 
s as we choose other targets  we may face uncertainty and litigation could result  which could lead to liability for damages  prevent our development and commercialization efforts  and divert resources from our business strategy 
legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in our technology field are still evolving 
therefore  the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights in our core technologies and products made using these technologies is also uncertain 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following 
the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  
we may be subject to interference proceedings  
the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection  
we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  
the patents licensed or issued to us or our customers may not provide a competitive advantage  
other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us or our customers  
other companies may independently develop similar or alternative technologies  or duplicate our technologies  and 
other companies may design around technologies we have licensed or developed 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any of our pending applications 
nor can we be certain that any of our issued patents would give us adequate protection from competing products 
for example  issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid  narrow in scope  or unenforceable 
in addition  since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make our inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions 
in the event that another party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention claimed by us  we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial uncertainties and cost for us  even if the eventual outcome were favorable to us 
it is also possible that others may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business 
as to those patents that we have licensed  our rights depend on maintaining our obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement  and we may be unable to do so 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding relating to our patents or applications  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
others seeking to develop next generation versions of proteins  or the holders of patents on our target proteins  may have greater financial resources  making them better able to bear the cost of litigation 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and market products  form strategic alliances  and compete in the marketplace 
in addition to patents and patent applications  we depend upon trade secrets and proprietary know how to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors  and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties 
we require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas  developments  discoveries  and inventions 
these agreements may not  however  provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how  or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure 
international patent protection is uncertain 
patent law outside the us is uncertain  and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we may participate in opposition proceedings to determine the validity of foreign patents belonging to us or our competitors  which proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts 
finally  some of our patent protection in the us is not available to us in foreign countries due to the differences in the patent laws of those countries 
we may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to maintain or obtain key technology from third parties 
we have licensed patents and patent applications from a number of institutions 
some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies 
the failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or modifications of our rights to these licenses 
additionally  we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base 
if our existing licenses are terminated or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms  our ability to perform our own research and development and to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative technologies 
risks related to competition we are exposed to intense competition from many sources 
our potential competitors include both public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
a number of these competitors are working on the development of next generation protein therapeutics 
compared to us  many of these companies have more 
financial  scientific  and technical resources  
product development  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  
experience conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of new products  and 
experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for products 
competitors may succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective and less costly than ours  which would render our products or technologies  or both  obsolete or noncompetitive 
for example  potential customers may develop other ways to achieve the benefits of our technology 
competitors also may prove to be more successful in designing  manufacturing and marketing of products 
if we are successful in developing our own drug candidates or versions of drugs that are no longer patented  we will compete with other drug manufacturers for market share 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our commercial opportunities will be diminished 
we operate in an environment of rapid technological change  and we may fall behind our competitors 
our business is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
new developments in molecular biology  medicinal chemistry  and other fields of biology and chemistry are expected to continue at a rapid pace in both industry and academia 
research and discoveries by others may render some or all of our target products or technologies  or both  noncompetitive or obsolete 
we know that other companies with substantial resources are working on the development of next generation proteins  and they may achieve better results in remodeling our target proteins or the target proteins of our potential collaborators 
we may be unable to retain key employees or recruit additional qualified personnel 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific  technical  and managerial personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in our business 
therefore  we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
the loss of the services of existing personnel  as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific  technical  and managerial personnel in a timely manner  would harm our research and development programs or our manufacturing capabilities 
risks related to government approvals we are subject to extensive government regulation  and we or our collaborators may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
the research  development  manufacture  marketing  and sale of our reagents and product candidates manufactured using our technologies are subject to significant  but varying  degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the us and other countries 
pharmaceutical product candidates manufactured using our technologies must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process before commercialization 
this process is regulated by the fda and by comparable agencies in the eu and other countries 
the us and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion to terminate clinical trials  require additional testing  delay or withhold registration and marketing approval  and mandate product withdrawals 
even if regulatory approvals were obtained  our manufacturing processes would be subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
any later discovery of unknown problems with our products  products incorporating our technologies  or manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  including potential withdrawal of the products from the market 
in addition  if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate or the manufacture of our reagents  then we may not obtain necessary approvals to market and sell the product candidate or reagents 
neither we nor our collaborators have submitted any product candidates for marketing approval to the fda or any other regulatory authority 
if any product candidate manufactured using our technology is submitted for regulatory approval  it may not receive the approvals necessary for commercialization  the desired labeling claims  or adequate levels of reimbursement 
any delay in receiving  or failure to receive  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to generate product revenues or royalties 
in addition  new governmental regulations may delay or alter regulatory approval of any product candidate manufactured using our technology 
we cannot predict the impact of adverse governmental action that might arise from future legislative and administrative action 
the use of hazardous materials in our operations may subject us to environmental claims or liability 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  and radioactive compounds 
the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
we do not maintain a separate insurance policy for these types of risks 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  and any liability could exceed our resources 
we are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant 
third party reimbursement for our collaborators or our future product candidates may not be adequate 
even if regulatory approval is obtained to sell any product candidates incorporating our technologies  our future revenues  profitability  and access to capital will be determined in part by the price at which we or our collaborators can sell such products 
there are continuing efforts by governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect a number of federal  state  and foreign proposals to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any health care reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign  and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the us  private health insurers  and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care typically is not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product research and development 
inadequate coverage and reimbursement levels provided by government and third party payors for use of our or our collaborators products may cause these products to fail to achieve market acceptance and would cause us to lose anticipated revenues and delay achievement of profitability 
risks related to stock market our stock price may continue to experience fluctuations 
the market prices of securities of thinly traded biotechnology companies  such as ours  have historically been highly volatile 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have a number of investors who hold relatively large positions in our securities 
a decision by any of these investors to sell all or a block of their holdings of our common stock could cause our stock price to drop significantly 
the market also continues to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  many of which are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in recent years  the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities in a fluctuating market  many or all of our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
if any of the risks described in these factors affecting the company s prospects occurred  or if any unforeseen risk affected our performance  it could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of government agency securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities held to maturity 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities  while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate of return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
as of december   the marketable securities that we held consisted of obligations of u 
s government agencies 
the approximate principal amount and weighted average interest rate per year of our investment portfolio as of december  was approximately million and  respectively 
we have exposure to changing interest rates on our taxable and tax exempt bonds  and we are currently not engaged in hedging activities 
interest on approximately million of outstanding indebtedness is relating to the bonds at an interest rate that varies weekly  depending on the market rates for aa rated taxable and tax exempt obligations 
as of december   the weighted average  effective interest rate was approximately per year
