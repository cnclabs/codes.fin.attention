part i item business general lanvision systems  inc lanvision tm or the company is a medical record workflow solution provider and application hosting services provider 
lanvision is a leading supplier of technologically advanced software and application hosting services specializing in web based applications that leverage the availability of the internet and intranets 
lanvision s medical record workflows allow authenticated users  such as physicians  nursed  administrative and financial personnel  and payers with access to patient healthcare information that exists in disparate systems across the continuum of care 
lanvision s software application products and services are complementary to existing clinical and financial systems  and use document imaging and advanced workflow tools to ensure users can electronically access both structured and unstructured patient data and all the various forms of clinical and financial healthcare information from a single permanent and secure repository  including clinician s handwritten notes  lab reports  photographs  insurance cards  etc 
lanvision s workflow solutions offer value to all of the constituents in the healthcare delivery process by enabling them to simultaneously access and utilize lanvision s advanced technological workflow applications to process the information  on a real time basis  from virtually any location  including the physician s desktop  using web based technology 
web access to the entire medical record repository improves physician and administrative personnel productivity  allows for multiple simultaneous access to the records necessary to review and complete  using completionanyware sm  the information necessary to process claims for payment  using codinganyware sm  and reduces administrative costs such as filing  storage  retrieval  using accessanyware sm and releaseanyware sm and upkeep of medical records and clinical costs  such as redundant diagnostic testing 
lanvision s solutions integrate a document imaging platform  application workflow suites  and image and web enabling tools  that allow for the seamless merger of back office functionality with existing clinical information systems at the desktop 
lanvision offers a document imaging management infrastructure foundation suite that is built for high volume transaction processing and is specifically designed for the healthcare industry 
in addition to providing access to information not previously available at the desktop  lanvision s applications fulfill the administrative and legal needs of the medical records and patient financial services departments 
furthermore  these systems have been specifically designed to integrate with any clinical information system 
for example  lanvision has integrated its products with selected systems from siemens medical solutions health services corporation siemens  and cerner corporation and will soon integrate its products with idx information systems corporation idx applications 
by offering electronic access to all the patient information components of the medical record  this integration completes one of the most difficult tasks necessary to provide a true electronic health record ehr 
lanvision s systems deliver on line enterprisewide access to fully updated patient information  which historically was maintained on a variety of media  including paper  magnetic disk  optical disk  and microfilm 
historically  lanvision has derived most of its revenues from systems sales and professional services involving the licensing  either directly or through remarketing partners  of its medical record workflow solutions to integrated healthcare delivery networks idn 
in a typical transaction  lanvision  or its remarketing partners  enter into a perpetual or term license or fee for service agreement for lanvision s software application suite and may license or sell other third party software and hardware components to the idn 
additionally  lanvision  or its remarketing partners provide professional services  including implementation  training  and product support 
with respect to systems sales  lanvision earns its highest margins on proprietary lanvision software or application hosting services and the lowest margins on third party hardware 
systems sales to customers may include different configurations of software hardware and professional services  resulting in varying margins among contracts 
the margins on professional services revenues fluctuate based upon the negotiated terms of the agreement with each customer and lanvision s ability to fully utilize its professional services  maintenance  and support services staff 
beginning in  lanvision began offering customers the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an application hosting basis as an application service provider asp 
lanvision established a hosting data center and installed lanvision s suite of workflow products  called aspen sm application service provider ehealth network within the hosting data center 
under this arrangement  customers electronically capture information and securely transmit the data to the hosting data center 
the aspen services store and manage the data using lanvision s suite of applications  and customers can view  print  fax  and process the information from anywhere using the lanvision web based applications 
lanvision charges and recognizes revenue for these aspen services on a per transaction or subscription basis as information is captured  stored  retrieved and processed 
in february  lanvision sold its application hosting data center 
simultaneously therewith  lanvision entered into an annual service agreement with the buyer 
under the terms of this service agreement  lanvision continued to use this data center through january lanvision has established a new application hosting data center in order to provide the capacity for all of its aspen services clients and into which it has consolidated its existing aspen application hosting services 
approximately  in new hardware and third party software has been leased or purchased  in fiscal year  for the new application hosting data center 
the decision by a healthcare provider to replace  substantially modify  or upgrade its information systems is a strategic decision and often involves a large capital commitment requiring an extended approval process 
since inception  lanvision has experienced extended sales cycles  which has adversely affected revenues 
it is not uncommon for sales cycles to take six to eighteen months from initial contact to the execution of an agreement 
as a result  the sales cycles can cause significant variations in quarter to quarter operating results 
these agreements cover the entire implementation and maintenance of the system and specify the installation schedule  which typically takes place in one or more phases 
the licensing agreements generally provide for the licensing of lanvision s proprietary software and third party software with a perpetual or term license fee that is adjusted depending on the number of concurrent users or workstations using the software 
third party hardware is sold outright  with a one time fee charged for installation and training 
site specific customization  interfaces with existing customer systems and other consulting services are sold on a fixed fee or a time and materials basis 
alternatively  with lanvision s aspen services solution  the application hosting services agreements generally provide for utilizing lanvision s software and third party software on a fee per transaction or subscription basis 
aspen services was designed to overcome obstacles in the buying decision such as large capital commitment  length of implementation  and the scarcity of time for healthcare information systems personnel to implement new systems 
lanvision believes that integrated delivery networks will begin to look for this type of asp application because of the ease of implementation and lower entry level costs 
lanvision believes its business model is especially well suited for the ambulatory marketplace and is actively pursuing remarketing agreements  in addition to those discussed below  with other healthcare information systems providers to distribute lanvision s workflow solutions 
generally  revenues from systems sales are recognized when an agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenues recognition related to routine installation  integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
if an agreement requires lanvision to perform services and modifications that are deemed significant to system acceptance  revenues are recorded either on the percentage of completion method or revenue related to the delivered hardware and software components is deferred until such obligations are deemed insignificant  depending on the contractual terms 
revenues from consulting  training  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of the revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
in september  lanvision entered into a new five year remarketing agreement with siemens medical solutions health services corporation to replace the then existing agreement that was scheduled to terminate in february under the terms of the new agreement  siemens was granted a nonexclusive worldwide license to market and distribute all of lanvision s software  as defined in the agreement 
under the terms of this remarketing agreement  siemens remits royalties to lanvision based upon siemens sublicensing of lanvision s software to siemens customers 
twenty five percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which siemens executes the end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty statement 
the remaining seventy five percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which siemens commences software implementation activities 
lanvision records this revenue when the payment due from siemens is fixed and determinable  which is usually when the software implementation activities commence 
in january  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  idx was granted a non exclusive worldwide license to distribute certain lanvision workflow software including accessanyware  codinganyware  and aspen application hosting services to idx customers and prospective customers  as defined in the remarketing agreement 
under the terms of this remarketing agreement  idx remits royalties to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty report 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on implementation milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
lanvision records this revenue when the seventy percent payment due from idx is fixed and determinable  which is generally when the software implementation activities commence 
in may  lanvision entered into a marketing and referral agreement with the m health information systems  a division of minnesota mining manufacturing co  whereby m health information systems and lanvision entered into a referral marketing agreement for its new product codinganyware 
revenues from this agreement are expected to begin in  after the general release of codinganyware 
lanvision s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to do so in the future because of various reasons including demand for lanvision s products and services  long sales cycles  and extended installation and implementation cycles based on customer s schedules 
sales are often delayed because of customers budgets and competing capital expenditure needs as well as personnel resource constraints within an integrated delivery network 
delays in anticipated sales or installations may have a significant impact on lanvision s quarterly revenues and operating results  because substantial portions of the operating expenses are relatively fixed 
healthcare industry background the us department of health and human services  in its national health expenditure projections released in january  believe that the health spending expenditures will reach trillion in  growing at an average annual rate of during the forecasted period as a share of the gross domestic product  health spending is projected to reach by up from its level of 
in response to this growth  the healthcare industry is undergoing significant change as competition and cost containment measures imposed by governmental and private payers have created significant pressures on healthcare providers to control healthcare costs while providing quality patient care 
at the same time  the healthcare delivery system is experiencing a shift from a highly fragmented group of non allied healthcare providers to integrated healthcare networks  which combine all of the services  products and equipment necessary to address the needs of healthcare customers 
as a result  healthcare providers are seeking to cut costs  increase productivity and enhance the quality of patient care through improved access to information throughout the entire hospital or integrated healthcare network 
today  the majority of the patient records are paper based 
the inefficiencies of paper based records increase the cost of patient care 
physicians often cannot gain access to medical records at the time of patient visits  and multiple users cannot simultaneously access the record when only a single copy of the paper based patient record is available 
based upon lanvision s experience in installing its systems  a typical bed hospital can produce  to  pages of new patient information each day even with computerized admission  billing  laboratory and radiology systems  and individual physician document retrieval requests can be as high as documents per physician per day 
the volume of medical images in the patient record is expanding as well 
in addition to images such as x rays and cat scans  new image forms such as digitized slides  videos and photographs proliferate 
thus  the ability to store and retrieve images of voluminous paper records and medical images on a timely basis is a critical feature of a complete computerized patient record 
in order to simultaneously reduce costs and enhance the level of patient care  hospitals and other healthcare providers are requiring comprehensive  cost effective information systems that deliver rapid access to fully updated and complete patient information 
traditional healthcare information systems are inadequate because i they do not capture large amounts of the patient records which are paper based and stored in various sites throughout the enterprise  ii computerized patient data is generated using a variety of disparate systems which cannot share information  and iii multimedia medical information such as x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information are frequently inaccessible at the point of patient care 
accordingly  hospitals and other healthcare providers have begun to increase their information systems expenditures 
in the eleventh annual healthcare information and management systems society himss leadership survey  healthcare business issues were driving information technology priorities with over half of the respondents indicating that cost pressures would continue to be a driving force in improving operational efficiencies 
included in the top ten information technology priorities was the implementation of computerized patient records 
respondents believe that implementing ehealth and hipaa health insurance portability and accountability act of strategies see regulations relating to confidentiality below 
will consume most of the information technology budget  because use of interactive ehealth solutions has become a competitive advantage 
providers  payers and suppliers know that the consequences of ignoring an ehealth strategy will result in the loss of market share 
lanvision believes that the hipaa regulations will be an impetus for idn s to embrace lanvision products and services as a means of ensuring compliance with the federal regulations 
a medical records institute annual survey of electronic health records trends and usage reported that one of the more interesting findings indicated that percent of the respondents indicated that they were considering implementing an electronic patient record via an application service provider such as lanvision over and in addition  many of the respondents indicated that they were looking to the asp model to provide connectivity to departmental systems  payers and health plans 
document imaging and workflow technologies are essential elements of a complete ehr because they allow for the storage of unstructured data ie  patient record elements other than data or text  such as hand written physician or nursing notes and physician orders  photographs  images of a document and they enable digitized x rays  cat scans  mri s  video and audio information to be accessed and delivered to the caregiver at the point of patient care 
lanvision believes the demand for its medical record workflow solutions  which can supply document imaging capabilities to the ehr  will increase in future years 
also  the himss leadership survey indicated that of the survey respondents were interested in outsourcing information technology functions in asp services 
additionally  the information technology individuals responding to the himss leadership survey indicated that security related to patient records to meet hipaa regulations was the second most important information technology priority within their institutions 
the number one priority was to deploy internet technology to support ehealth by moving healthcare information to the web 
in addition to mandated hipaa regulations  the healthcare industry is being strongly encouraged by many professional medical organizations to make greater use of information technology 
a report by the institute of medicine iom of the national academies  entitled to err is human building a better health system  envisioned a revamped system that  among other things  makes greater use of information technology to enable providers and institutions to move away from paper based medical record systems to take advantage of new information technology 
the american medical association  american academy of family physicians  american college of physicians  american society of internal medicine  and the american college of surgeons  issued a joint statement supporting the iom recommendations 
regulations relating to confidentiality federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient health information 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are evolving as the final federal regulations are published 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information phi 
the legislation requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
regulations adopted pursuant to hipaa include rules addressing several areas 
the privacy rule with modifications was finalized august  compliance with the new privacy rule is required by most covered entities other than small health plans by april  the final privacy rule also extended the scope of enforcement to phi residing on non electronic media  such as paper  as well as to email  oral and written communications 
the final security rule with modifications was published february  the regulations under the security rule will be effective on april   with a compliance date of months later  or april  small health plans have until april  to comply with the security rule 
lanvision believes that the regulations issued to date would not have a material adverse affect on its business 
lanvision cannot predict the potential impact of the regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
lanvision believes that the features and architecture of lanvision s products are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of products and adversely effect the licensing of lanvision s products 
overall  lanvision believes the hipaa regulations will stimulate healthcare organizations to purchase computer based patient health systems that automate the collection  use  and disclosure of patient health information  while maintaining appropriate security and audit controls over the information 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of lanvision application hosting services will occur 
rapid technological change and evolving market the market for lanvision s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  lanvision s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
lanvision s future success will depend  in part  upon lanvision s ability to enhance its existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing requirements 
changes and consolidation in the healthcare industry lanvision derives substantially all of its revenues from the licensing of software  providing professional services and maintenance services and providing application hosting services within the healthcare industry 
accordingly  the success of lanvision is dependent upon the regulatory and economic conditions in the healthcare industry 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to establish integrated delivery networks to take advantage of economies of scale  greater marketing power and greater leverage in negotiating with venders who supply the industry with the goods and services they require 
the impact of such consolidations lanvision believes  will benefit lanvision as more healthcare organizations investigate methods to streamline operations  including outsourcing non core services to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care through the use of information technology  especially in the paper intensive area of patient medical records 
key personnel lanvision s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management and technical personnel 
lanvision must recruit  motivate and retain highly skilled managers  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which lanvision s products operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
limited protection of proprietary technology the success of lanvision depends on the protection of its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary technology 
lanvision relies on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure  license  and employment agreements  trade secret laws  copyrights  and restrictions on the disclosure of its intellectual property 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to lanvision s products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend lanvision s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
lanvision could also be required to defend itself against claims made by third parties for intellectual property right infringement 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
lanvision is currently litigating two cases to protect lanvision s proprietary technology that it believes is being used by others without lanvision s permission 
the outcome of the litigation is presently not determinable 
however  lanvision believes that its claims are valid and can be substantiated 
the remedies and damages available to lanvision  if any  are not presently determinable 
warranties and indemnities lanvision s products are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
failure of any lanvision product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require lanvision to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possible subjecting lanvision to liability 
also  lanvision indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
if lanvision becomes liable to a third party for infringement of their intellectual property  lanvision could be required to pay substantial amounts as damages  obtain a license to use the infringing technologies  develop its own noninfringing technologies  or cease using the infringing intellectual property 
competition several companies historically have dominated the healthcare clinical information system software market and several of these companies have either acquired or developed their own document imaging and workflow technologies 
the industry is currently undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
strategic alliances between vendors offering medical record workflow and document imaging technologies and vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing 
barriers to entry to this market include technological and application sophistication  the ability to offer a proven product  a well established customer base and distribution channels  brand recognition  the ability to operate on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms  the ability to integrate with pre existing systems and capital for sustained development and marketing activities 
lanvision believes that these barriers taken together represent a moderate to high level barrier to entry 
foreign competition has not been a significant factor in the market  to date 
lanvision s competitors include clinical information system vendors that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources than lanvision 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom lanvision may establish strategic alliances may also compete with lanvision 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding lanvision  place bids for large agreements in competition with lanvision 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by lanvision could have a material adverse effect on lanvision 
lanvision believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  lanvision believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
lanvision believes that its principal competitors are american management systems  incorporated  cerner corporation  mckesson hboc  inc  medplus  inc a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated and eclipsys corporation 
the lanvision solution lanvision s healthcare information access systems provide medical record workflow solutions for the patient information access needs of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks 
lanvision s systems enable medical and administrative personnel to rapidly and efficiently capture  store  manage  route  retrieve and process vast amounts of clinical and financial patient information 
lanvision s systems i capture and store electronic data from disparate hospital information systems through real time  computerized interfaces  ii allows for the storage of digitized data and medical images such as cat scans  and mri s  iii provide applications for efficiently scanning and automatically indexing paper based records  iv allow storage of a patient s lifetime medical record on magnetic storage and optical disks which also provides rapid access to high volumes of data enterprisewide  v provide technologically advanced workflow automation software to facilitate the re engineering of business processes  and vi incorporate physician oriented interfaces that allow the user to easily locate and retrieve patient information in the hospital or clinical setting  including the point of patient care 
lanvision s medical record workflow solutions provide financial  administrative  and clinical benefits to the healthcare provider and facilitate more effective patient care 
these benefits include improved access to patient information to assist in making informed clinical and financial decisions  reduced costs for administrative personnel due to increased workflow efficiency  as data can be routed within an organization to all users who need to process that information simultaneously or in sequence as required  increased productivity through the elimination of file contention by providing multiple users simultaneous access to patient medical records  reduced costs and improved care through the reduction of unnecessary testing and admissions  improved cash flow through accelerated account receivable collections and reductions in technical denials which occur when a third party payer refuses payment because of the provider s inability to substantiate billing claims due to loss of portions or all of the patient record  expedited treatment decisions  and fewer redundant tests as a result of timely access to complete information  fewer medical record errors by minimizing misfiled  lost and improperly completed records  and increased security of patient information through improved controls on access to confidential data and the creation of audit trails that identify the persons who accessed or even tried to access such information 
the lanvision strategy lanvision s objective is to continue to be a leading provider of medical record workflow solutions to the healthcare industry 
important elements of lanvision s business strategy include expand distribution channels lanvision estimates the market for lanvision s products and services could be in excess of billion  and the market is less than penetrated 
a recent healthcare industry report stated that in order to comply with the hipaa healthcare information electronic transmission regulations  healthcare systems will need to adjust existing systems or purchase new information technology systems  hire and retrain staff  and make significant changes to the current processes associated with maintaining patient privacy  the cost of which is estimated to be somewhere between three to four times the amount of expenditures required for year remediation  or an amount in excess of billion 
lanvision strongly believes its highly evolved  secure and technologically advanced web browser based asp solutions will position lanvision to take advantage of  what it continues to believe will be  significantly increasing market opportunities for lanvision and its distribution partners in the future 
in  lanvision took a major step forward in improving and expanding its sales distribution when it entered into a remarketing agreement with siemens medical solutions health services corporation  one of the leading providers of information technology to the healthcare industry 
siemens serves more than  healthcare organizations throughout north america and europe  and sells lanvision s products as an integrated component of the novius product line 
in  lanvision entered into an agreement with iron mountain incorporated  a leader in records and information management services  in which lanvision will integrate its document imaging and workflow products with iron mountain s digital archives services and develop joint marketing programs 
in  lanvision entered into a five year remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation  which offers a wide variety of patient care products to integrated delivery networks  group practices  academic medical centers  radiological centers  and hospitals nationwide 
idx has installed its products at more than  customers sites with systems deployed to serve over  physicians 
under the terms of the agreement  idx was granted a non exclusive worldwide license to distribute accessanyware  codinganyware  and aspen services to idx customers and prospective customers  as defined in the agreement 
idx s will sell lanvision s electronic medical record workflow and document imaging products as an integrated component of the idx clinical information systems  which idx can remarket as an integrated solution with either idx product carecast or lastword 
in  lanvision entered into a new two year marketing and referral agreement with the m health information systems  a division of the minnesota mining and manufacturing company  whereby m and lanvision will refer prospective customers for the other s products and services 
m will refer potential customers to use the lanvision codinganyware software and lanvision will refer potential customers to us the m healthcare products  including their coding and reimbursement software  which is complementary to the lanvision codinganyware software 
it is lanvision s intention to develop additional remarketing alliances with other healthcare information systems  medical records management  and medical records outsourcing vendors and to explore other means of expanding lanvision s distribution channels 
application service provider application hosting services beginning in  lanvision began offering customers the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an application hosting basis as an asp 
lanvision established a hosting data center and installed lanvision s suite of workflow products  called aspen application service provider ehealth network within the hosting data center  which utilizes lanvision s web browser based applications across an internet intranet  to deliver high quality  transaction based services to healthcare providers from a centrally located data center 
aspen enables its healthcare customers to achieve enhanced patient care  improved security  and accessibility to patient records at significant cost savings with minimal up front capital investment  maintenance  and support costs 
customers realize benefits more quickly  with less economic risk 
customers are charged on a per transaction or subscription basis  which is an attractive alternative to purchasing an in house system 
this service is made possible through the advancement of web browser based technology  state of the art communication technology and advanced software design 
maintain technological leadership through the development of new software applications and increased functionality of existing applications lanvision intends to continue its product development efforts and increase the functionality of existing applications along with the development of new applications using document imaging and workflow technologies 
in particular  lanvision intends to increase the functionality of its web based applications 
lanvision has continued to add new features and functionality to its suite of products  including non patient folders  business office workflow applications  etc 
lanvision has released its latest generation product  accessanyware  a web based application with a user interface that includes the best features of lanvision s entire product portfolio 
the accessanyware application utilizes a common database for medical records and patient accounting  thereby improving system administration and eliminating redundant data entry 
lanvision has released its newest product  codinganyware  an application that provides workflow automation of the coding and abstracting process by allowing hospital personnel to electronically access documents to be coded and abstracted from remote locations  including the employee s home 
the codinganyware product can also be integrated with third party encoding or abstracting software  such as m  thus avoiding redundant data entry 
lanvision believes only the most robust  flexible  dependable products will survive in the healthcare market  and lanvision has attempted to establish itself as the leader in document imaging management and workflow applications through strong product development 
image enable clinical data repositories and other applications software today  healthcare information is often stored on numerous dissimilar host based and departmental systems that are spread throughout an enterprise and are not integrated 
additionally  these current systems do not address the data stored on paper or the increasing volume of medical images such as  cat scans  digitized slides  exploratory scopes  photographs  audio  etc 
lanvision believes the efficiencies and productivity of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks can be greatly enhanced by seamlessly integrating their historical information systems with document imaging and workflow applications 
physicians  clinicians  and other healthcare users then have access to the complete patient record  including the structured data  such as a lab result  and the related unstructured data  or a doctor s hand written notes 
lanvision has image enabled many popular clinical data repositories  such as those offered by oacis healthcare holdings corp  idx information systems corporation  and cerner corporation 
lanvision is marketing image enabling technology through its accessanyware  webview tm and lv application bridge products 
lanvision intends to continue to aggressively market its unique image enabling solutions to end users and other third party software application providers

lanvision s systems operate on multiple imaging platforms  including siemens and filenet 
lanvision s medical record workflow solutions incorporate advanced features  including workflow and security features that allow customers to restrict direct access to confidential patient information  secure patient data from unauthorized indirect access and have audit trail features 
a brief description of lanvision s products follows lanvision products and services are built using advanced document imaging management and workflow automation technology to create robust medical records workflow solutions 
document imaging technology makes paper based information  as well as medical images  sound and video information as readily available and easy to process as traditional electronic data 
workflow automation offers intelligent electronic routing of documents  sophisticated management tools and reporting to increase efficiency and to support business process re engineering efforts 
lanvision s products and services were designed to be complementary with existing third party healthcare information systems his applications and asp based services  providing value added functionality to these third party applications  including the following the ability to gain seamless electronic access to paper based medical records  business office documents and medical images unstructured data  workflow based automated chart deficiency analysis and completion  workflow based automated release of information and billing  workflow based remote coding and seamless integration to third party encoder and abstracter software  and archival support for a legal historical repository of patient information 
lanvision has developed innovative application tool sets to image and web enable existing his clinical and billing applications  thus allowing clients to have a common graphical user interface on a universal workstation 
lanvision has also developed its own proprietary document imaging middleware foundation suite to efficiently provide the object oriented business processes common to all of its applications  such as scanning indexing  faxing printing  data archiving migration  security and auditing 
through its application software  document imaging middleware  and its workflow  image and web enabling tools  lanvision allows the seamless merging of its medical record and patient billing department back office functionality with existing clinical information systems at the desktop 
for maximum flexibility  the most current lanvision family of products and services is made up of five distinct offerings the accessanyware application suite  codinganyware  the lanvision application bridge  the foundation suite  and aspen services 
the accessanyware application suite 


a web browser based application suite the accessanyware application is lanvision s fifth generation web based electronic medical record application that provides authorized users with access to all the various forms of patient health information from a single point of entry 
it allows authorized users to perform document searching  retrieval  viewing  processing  printing and faxing  as well as report generation 


all from a single login 
the completionanyware application is an integrated module of accessanyware that provides analysts and clinicians the ability to remotely analyze and complete deficient records 
in addition to a single login  accessanyware delivers a single user interface and integrated database 
therefore  from a single login to the system  users with appropriate security have the ability to search and retrieve information regarding patients and cases for chart analysis  view  print and fax patient documents  as well as analyze or complete deficient documents  via the completionanyware module 
the functions presented to the user vary with the user s security 
for example  if the user is a clinician  he she is presented with an inbox function that displays a list of incomplete charts awaiting completion and a list of linked patients assigned to them 
the clinician then has the option to complete deficient charts  or retrieve patient information  via searching or by clicking on the linked patients within their inbox 
this access may occur from any workstation within the facility  the physician s office  or some other remote site 
with proper security the user is able to view  print and fax patient information 
lanvision clients also have the option of further enhancing the productivity of their operations through the releaseanyware module 
the releaseanyware application fulfills internal and external requests for patient information and allows for automatic invoicing capability 
it also provides the ability to electronically search for  print  mail or fax information to third parties that request copies of patient records 
codinganyware 


coding capabilities  anywhere  anytime due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient

research and development lanvision continues to focus its research and development efforts to develop new application software and increase the functionality of existing applications 
customer requirements and desires significantly influence lanvision s research and development efforts 
in and  lanvision significantly expanded its development efforts 
in late and early  lanvision completed many of its major development projects 
whereupon  lanvision began to reduce the use of outside contractors and development staff as projects were completed 
product research and development expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
in addition  lanvision also capitalized   and  of research and development expenditures in  and  respectively 
existing customers lanvision s customers include healthcare providers located throughout the united states 
lanvision has implemented or is in the process of implementing one or more of its systems in the following institutions albert einstein healthcare network  philadelphia  pa beth israel medical center  new york  ny  including phillips ambulatory care center  new york  ny children s medical center of dallas  dallas  tx christiana care health services  new castle  de holzer medical center  gallipolis  oh medical college of georgia  augusta  ga medical university hospital authority medical university of south carolina  columbia  sc memorial sloan kettering cancer center  new york  ny ohiohealth corporation grant riverside methodist hospitals  columbus  oh promedica health systems  toledo  oh stanford hospital and clinics  palo alto  ca texas health resources  inc harris methodist hospital  fort worth  tx upmc health system  pittsburgh  pa aspen application hosting customers the health alliance of greater cincinnati  cincinnati  oh children s hospital  columbus  oh kettering medical center network  kettering  oh m

in fiscal year  siemens medical solutions  memorial sloan kettering cancer center  and the health alliance of greater cincinnati accounted for  and  respectively  of lanvision s total revenues 
in fiscal year  siemens medical solutions  memorial sloan kettering cancer center  and the health alliance of greater cincinnati  accounted for  and  respectively  of lanvision s total revenues the small number of customers and extended sales cycles has contributed to variability in quarterly and annual operating results 
lanvision expects that as its customer base continues to increase  and sales through its remarketing agreements increase and the actions of any one customer will have less of an effect on its quarterly and annual operating results 
signed agreements backlog lanvision enters into master agreements with its customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed and or services to be provided by lanvision  the agreed upon aggregate price and the timetable for implementation 
the master agreement typically provides that lanvision will deliver the system in phases pursuant to the customer s purchase orders  thereby allowing the customer flexibility in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in customer needs 
the master agreement also allows the customer to request additional components as the installation progresses  which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and terms 
historically  customers have ultimately purchased systems and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the master agreement  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
at january   lanvision has master agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based revenues for the application hosting services which have not been delivered  installed and accepted which  if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  the related products and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
furthermore  lanvision has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  over the remaining lives of the agreements 
lanvision s master agreements also generally provide for an initial maintenance period and give the customer the right to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
maintenance and support revenues for fiscal years  and were approximately   and  respectively 
maintenance and support revenues are expected to increase in at january   lanvision had maintenance agreements  purchase orders or royalty reports from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal lanvision expects that two existing agreements currently under negotiation will be extended during fiscal  which will add significantly to this application hosting backlog 
the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  lanvision is unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
lanvision s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by lanvision  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of lanvision to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on lanvision s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
royalties lanvision incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate lanvision s proprietary software 
lanvision licenses these software products  and pays the required royalties and or license fees when such software is delivered to lanvision s customers 
employees as of january   lanvision had full time employees 
in addition  lanvision utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of lanvision s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
lanvision has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good 
item properties lanvision s principal offices are located at creek road  cincinnati  ohio the offices consist of approximately  square feet of space under a lease that expires in january in addition  lanvision leases dedicated collocation data center space in two locations in the cincinnati  oh area  for the aspen services  application hosting data center operations 
the current rental expense for all of these facilities approximates  annually 
lanvision believes that its facilities are adequate for its current needs and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of lanvision s operations 
item legal proceedings lanvision is a party to various legal proceedings and claims  which arise  in the ordinary course of business from time to time 
currently  lanvision is a party to several pending lawsuits that were initiated by lanvision to protect its intellectual property rights  to enforce non competition covenants and or to prevent third parties from improperly interfering in lanvision s business 
the defendants in one or more of these actions have asserted  and may assert in the future  counterclaims against lanvision 
while the outcome of these claims  as well as any claims that may not have yet been asserted against lanvision  whether in these actions or otherwise  cannot be predicted with certainty at this time  lanvision is not aware of any legal matters that will have a material adverse effect on lanvision s consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see also part  item  business for a general description of lanvision s business 
application of critical accounting policies see also notes to consolidated financial statements 
lanvision s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires lanvision to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  lanvision evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  support contracts and contingencies and litigation 
lanvision bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that lanvision believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
lanvision believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lanvision records revenues for customer contracts  including special payment agreements and royalties from third party resellers in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue is derived from the licensing and sale of systems  either directly to end users or through third party resellers  comprising internally developed software  third party software and hardware components  product support  maintenance and professional services  and  application hosting services that provide high quality  transaction or subscriptions based document imaging management services from a central data center 
generally  revenues from software license fees and hardware sales to end users are recognized when a master agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenues from agreements that contain multiple element arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the elements 
revenues related to routine installation and integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
if a contract requires lanvision to perform services and modifications that are deemed significant to system acceptance  revenues are recorded either on the percentage of completion method or revenue related to the delivered hardware and software components are deferred until such obligations are deemed insignificant  depending on the contractual terms 
lanvision follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenues from consulting  education  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
under the terms of a remarketing agreement with siemens medical solutions health services corporation  siemens remits royalties to lanvision based upon siemens sublicensing lanvision s software to siemens s customers 
twenty five percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which siemens executes the end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty report 
the remaining seventy five percent of the royalty is due from siemens when software implementation activities commence 
lanvision records this revenue when the seventy five percent payment due from siemens is fixed and determinable  which is generally when software implementation activities commence under the terms of a remarketing agreement with idx information systems corporation royalties are remitted by idx to lanvision based upon idx sublicensing lanvision s software to idx s customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which idx executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
lanvision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty report 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from idx  in varying amounts based on implementation milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
lanvision records this revenue when the seventy percent payment due from idx is fixed and determinable  which is generally when the software implementation activities commence 
each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
bad debts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed lanvision for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting activities 
contracts with individual customers and resellers determine when receivables are due 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof 
corrective action  if necessary  is taken by lanvision to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these quarterly reviews  lanvision determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of lanvision s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell lanvision s products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of lanvision receivables is not uncommon 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and product quality assurance  are capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
lanvision capitalized   and  in  and  respectively 
research and development expense  net of capitalized amounts  was   and  in  and  respectively 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis over the estimated economic life of the software  not to exceed three years  using the straight line method 
amortization commences when a product is available for general release to customers 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at the date of such determination 
amortization expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
lanvision reviews  on an on going basis  the carrying value of its capitalized software development costs  net of accumulated amortization 
lanvision believes that to replicate the existing software would cost significantly more than the stated value of  at january  over the last three years  lanvision has spent  in research and development  of which  or  has been capitalized 
amortization of capitalized software during the last three years has amounted to  or a net increase in capitalized software of only  during the last three years 
many of the programs related to capitalized software development continue to have great value to lanvision s current products and those under development as the concepts and ideas are readily transferable and are incorporated into new products 
contractual obligations capitalized leases long term debt accrued interest  assuming no warrant value see below operating leases total capitalized leases during fiscal year lanvision acquired computer equipment and related software for a new application hosting services data center  which are accounted for as capitalized leases 
the amount of the leased assets by category are computer equipment  computer software  and prepaid maintenance and expenses  for a total of  in new assets 
the leases are payable monthly in installments of  through august and an additional amount of  through december the present value of the future lease payments upon lease inception was  using the interest rates implicit in the lease agreements at the inception of the leases 
long term debt the long term debt of  is secured by all of the assets of lanvision and the loan agreement  as amended  restricts lanvision from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money  including capitalized leases  limits certain investments  restricts substantial asset sales  capital expenditures  cash dividends  stock repurchases  and mergers and consolidations with unaffiliated entities without lender consent 
in addition  lanvision is required to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum levels of revenues  earnings  and net worth 
also  the loan agreement requires lanvision to maintain a minimum cash balance of  through april   at which time the amount is reduced to  through july   at which time the amount is reduced to  which will be maintained through the maturity of the loan in july lanvision was in compliance with all of the covenants during fiscal lanvision believes that it will be able to comply with all of its covenants in fiscal  and the likelihood of defaulting on the debt covenants is not likely absent any material adverse events that may affect the healthcare industry or our market 
in the past lanvision has requested  and the lender has granted  waivers of certain debt covenants 
however  our expectations of future operating results and continued compliance with the debt covenants cannot be assured and the lenders actions are not controllable by us 
if our projections of future operating results are not achieved and the debt is placed in default  lanvision would experience a material adverse impact on the reported financial position and results of operations 
in connection with the issuance of the long term debt  lanvision issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock of lanvision at per share at any time through july  the warrants are subject to customary antidilution and registration rights provisions 
under the terms of the long term debt agreement  lanvision has guaranteed the lender that the increase in the market value of the stock underlying the warrants  at the time of loan maturity  over the exercise price plus the interest paid on the loan will yield the lender a compound annual return 
if the yield from the warrants plus interest paid does not provide the lender with the guaranteed compound annual return  lanvision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at the time of maturity 
accordingly  lanvision is accruing interest on the loan at a compound interest rate  regardless of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the warrants 
assuming that the warrants have no value  the maximum amount of the accrued and unpaid interest at maturity in july will be  operating leases lanvision rents office and data center space and equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire in fiscal the minimum payments  by year  are detailed in the table above 
warranties and indemnities lanvision provides for the estimated cost of the product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
should products fail to meet certain performance standards for an initial warranty period  lanvision s estimated warranty liability might need to be increased 
lanvision bases its warranty estimates on the nature of any performance complaint  the effort necessary to resolve the issue  customer requirements and any potential concessions which may be required to be granted to a customer which result from performance issues 
lanvision s aspen application hosting services guarantees specific up time and response time performance standards  which  if not met may result in reduced revenues  as a penalty  for the month in which the standards are not met 
lanvision s standard agreements with its customers also usually include provisions to indemnify them from and against third party claims  liabilities  damages  and expenses arising out of lanvision s operation of its business or any negligent act or omission of lanvision 
to date lanvision has always maintained the aspen performance standards and has not been required to make any material penalty payments to customers or indemnify any customers for any material third party claims 
at january  and lanvision has a warranty reserve in the amount of  each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate lanvision client manager to determine the need for a warranty reserve based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for each fiscal year indicated  certain operating data as percentages consolidated statements of operations fiscal year systems sales services  maintenance and support application hosting services total revenues cost of sales selling  general and administrative product research and development total operating expenses operating profit other income expense  net income taxes net earnings cost of systems sales cost of services  maintenance and support cost of application hosting services because a significant percentage of the operating costs are expensed as incurred  a variation in the timing of systems sales and installations and the resulting revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results 
as a result  period to period comparisons may not be meaningful with respect to the past operations nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operations 
the data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to revenues for the periods indicated 
all references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year commencing on february of that calendar year and ending on january of the following year 
comparison of fiscal year with revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year were  compared with revenues of  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily the result of increased systems sales and increased professional services revenues 
approximately of fiscal revenues came from fulfillment of backlog and add on business  primarily expansion and upgrades of systems for lanvision s existing and new clients  and came from resellers  compared with and  respectively in fiscal revenues from siemens were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and through idx   in fiscal  the first year of the agreement 
revenues from systems sales in fiscal were  an increase of  or of systems sales in fiscal resulting primarily from upgrading and expansion of systems with existing clients 
revenues from services  maintenance  and support in fiscal were  an increase of  or over fiscal professional services revenues in fiscal were  an increase of  or of the professional services revenues in fiscal the increase was caused by higher utilization of existing staff in and significant new installations in compared with maintenance and support revenues in fiscal were  an increase of  or over maintenance and support revenues in fiscal the increase in maintenance and support revenues in fiscal is primarily due to new installations by our remarketing partners  and expansion of existing lanvision client systems  offset by some reductions in maintenance as some customers transitioned to non lanvision systems 
revenues from application hosting services increased  or 
the increase was due to the addition of two new application hosting services clients in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal application hosting services revenues at some locations were usage based and fluctuations in admissions  length of stay  return patient visits  etc 
affect the system usage and the corresponding application hosting services revenues 
in fiscal  three customers accounted for of the total revenues compared with in fiscal  exclusive of our remarketing partners 
revenues for fiscal and were less than lanvision s plan for each year 
the shortfall in anticipated revenues occurred for various reasons  including significantly lower spending on information technology by healthcare institutions as many institutions delayed implementation for new electronic medical record emr systems until final federal health privacy regulations to comply with hipaa were issued 
buying decisions at certain hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks are influenced by recommendations of the largest healthcare information systems vendors  including siemens medical solutions health services corporation  mckesson hboc  inc  cerner corporation  idx information systems corporation and eclipsys corporation 
it continues to be difficult for companies with relatively small sales forces to influence the buying decisions as effectively as the major his vendors which is why lanvision transitioned its distribution model from a direct selling organization to primarily an indirect distribution  primarily through remarketers  such as siemens and idx  and the asp application hosting services based delivery model 
the original remarketing agreement with siemens was signed in  and throughout fiscal  and  lanvision and siemens integrated the lanvision product line with the siemens novius product 
the final integration and testing of the products was completed in late during  and most of  siemens remarketed lanvision s products on a limited basis through their specialized document imaging sales force 
siemens successfully closed four new agreements for lanvision s products in  four in  five in  eight new agreements in and one new agreement in siemens has recently advised lanvision that they have undertaken development of their own medical records document imaging application that will ultimately compete with lanvision s application 
at this time  lanvision is unable to assess the impact of future sublicensing of lanvision software applications by siemens as a result of this decision by siemens but lanvision expects that this decision may have a negative impact on closing future agreements 
the twenty two agreements represent approximately  in software royalties to lanvision 
approximately   and  of software royalties were recognized in  and  respectively  and approximately  of software royalties has not yet been recognized until siemens commences software implementation 
the idx remarketing agreement  which was signed in january  has resulted in two signed agreements in fiscal year and represents approximately  in software royalties to lanvision 
lanvision believes a greater percentage of its future revenues will come from remarketing agreements with siemens  idx  m and other his vendors 
lanvision continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other companies 
lanvision believes the large his vendors  hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks now have a better understanding of the valuable role the emr plays in providing a truly computerized patient record 
as more companies demonstrate the significant economic and operating benefits of the emr and other imaging management and workflow applications  lanvision believes the future demand for its products and services will increase 
many new companies have emerged to provide healthcare applications through private intranets or secure applications on the internet 
additionally  the traditional his companies have developed clinical information systems for the internet 
lanvision s applications are well suited for integration with such clinical systems and are optimized for use on the internet and private intranets 
through lanvision s aspen services  application hosting customers can rapidly deploy and access healthcare information using web browser based technology from a central data center on a per transaction or subscription basis thereby minimizing up front capital expenditures 
lanvision believes healthcare organizations will continue to increase their use of healthcare applications through the internet  and lanvision s products are an integral part of providing a complete ehr across the internet 
lanvision continues to actively pursue strategic relationships with other healthcare application service providers 
management believes that revenue growth in will be fueled by an increase in incremental revenue from existing and new strategic distribution partners  an increase in interest by healthcare organizations in lanvision products and services to assist in compliance with the federal hipaa standards as they relate to the confidentiality and security of medical records  and incremental new revenues derived from a new and exciting line of business for lanvision in the remote coding marketplace 
due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of cost of systems sales  cost of services  maintenance and support and cost of application hosting services 
cost of systems sales includes amortization of capitalized software costs  royalties  and the cost of third party hardware and software 
cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the cost of systems sales as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and were and  respectively 
the higher costs in reflect a significantly higher volume of hardware and third party components  with lower margins 
cost of services  maintenance  and support includes salaries and benefits for support and professional services personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
cost of services  maintenance and support as a percentage of services  maintenance and support revenues in and were and  respectively 
the lower relative cost reflects greater efficiencies in providing the service 
the cost of application hosting services represents primarily processing fees paid to a third party data center provider for most of the year and the cost associated with establishing and operating  for part of the year  a new data center as discussed above which increased expenses relative to revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs  travel and living expenses  trade shows  etc 
for selling and marketing activities and general corporate and administrative activities 
in fiscal  selling  general  and administrative expenses were  compared with  in fiscal the  increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to increased legal costs of asserting lanvision s intellectual property rights in two cases to protect lanvision s proprietary technology that it believes is being used by others without lanvision s permission 
also  lanvision s sales costs increased as lanvision expanded its direct sales organization to handle the increased inquiries into lanvision s products and services 
this expansion of the direct sales organization resulted in two new direct clients for the aspen application hosting services 
product research and development 
product research and development expenses in fiscal were  compared with  in fiscal the decrease reflects primarily the increased capitalized software development costs 
during  lanvision concentrated its development efforts primarily on its new products accessanyware and codinganyware

professional services revenues in fiscal were  a decrease of  or of the professional services revenues in fiscal the decrease was caused by lower utilization of existing staff in revenues from application hosting services decreased  or 
the decrease was due to a temporary short term decline in the volume of usage by our largest application hosting client 
application hosting services revenues are usage based and fluctuations in admissions  length of stay  return patient visits  etc 
affect the system usage and the corresponding application hosting services revenues 
in fiscal  three customers accounted for of the total revenues compared with in fiscal  exclusive of our remarketing partner siemens 
revenues for fiscal and were less than lanvision s plan for each year 
the shortfall in revenues occurred for various reasons  including significantly lower spending on information technology by healthcare institutions as many institutions delayed implementation for new electronic medical record systems until final federal health privacy regulations to comply with hipaa are issued 
buying decisions at certain hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks are influenced by recommendations of the largest healthcare information systems vendors  including siemens medical solutions health services corporation  mckesson hboc  inc  cerner corporation  idx information systems corporation and eclipsys corporation 
it continues to be difficult for companies with relatively small sales forces to influence the buying decisions as effectively as the major his vendors which is why lanvision has transitioned its distribution model from a direct selling organization to indirect distribution  primarily through remarketers  such as siemens and idx  and the asp application hosting services based delivery model

since commencing operations in  lanvision has incurred substantial operating losses 
although lanvision achieved profitability in fiscal years    and  lanvision incurred a net loss in fiscal years through based upon the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability is dependent upon increasing revenues 
there can be no assurance that lanvision will be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of lanvision in the near or long term 
liquidity and capital resources during the last five fiscal years  lanvision has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  and a  loan 
lanvision s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors to include the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  amounts invested in research and development and capital expenditures  and the level of operating expenses 
lanvision s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major healthcare information systems companies that resell lanvision products which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
lanvision has no significant obligations for capital resources  other than its long term debt and accrued interest described below  the noncancelable operating leases in the total amount of approximately  payable over the next four years and capitalized leases in the total amount of approximately  payable over the next three years 
in july  upon maturity of the long term debt  lanvision may  under the terms of the long term debt agreement  be required to pay to the lender an amount necessary so that the market value of the stock underlying the warrants issued to the lender in connection with the long term debt  plus the interest paid on the loan will yield the lender a compound annual return 
if the yield from the warrants plus interest paid does not provide the lender with the guaranteed compound annual return  lanvision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at the time of maturity 
accordingly  lanvision is accruing interest on the loan at a compound interest rate  regardless of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the warrants 
the current estimate of the maximum amount at maturity  which would be required to be paid to the lender  assuming the warrants have no value  is approximately  if the market price of lanvision s common stock exceeds per share the purchase price of the warrant then the value of the warrant would reduce the amount of the accrued and unpaid interest required to be paid at maturity by such value 
depending on the amount of cash lanvision has at that time  and the value of the warrants  id any  it may be necessary for lanvision to borrow funds or obtain additional equity in order to fund the deferred interest payable to the lender at that time 
lanvision believes that continued operating performance improvements should enable it to fund a portion of any obligation and borrow the additional funds necessary to retire the obligation at maturity 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
over the last several years  lanvision s revenues were less than its internal plans 
however  during the same period  lanvision has expended significant amounts for capital expenditures  product research and development  sales  support and consulting expenses 
this resulted in significant net cash outlays over the last five years 
although lanvision has reduced staffing levels and related expenses  increased revenues and improved operating performance  lanvision s expenses will continue to increase 
accordingly  to continue to achieve increasing profitability  and positive cash flow  it is necessary for lanvision to increase revenues or continue to reduce expenses 
lanvision believes that the requirement for healthcare organizations to become hipaa compliant  and the recent signing of the idx information systems corporation remarketing agreement and the m marketing and referral agreement should offer significant opportunities to increase revenues 
lanvision believes that market opportunities are such that lanvision should be able to increase its revenues 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be able to do so 
in february  lanvision sold its data center for  lanvision received  and the remaining  was received in twelve monthly installments commencing march  the sale resulted in a gain of approximately  at january   lanvision had cash and cash equivalents of  cash equivalents consist primarily of overnight bank repurchase agreements and short term commercial paper 
under the terms of its loan agreement  as amended  lanvision has agreed to maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalent balance of  through april   at which time the amount is reduced to  through july   at which time the amount is reduced to  which will be maintained through the maturity of the loan in july during fiscal   of long term debt is required to be repaid to the lender 
lanvision has carefully monitored operating expenses during the last three fiscal years  and believes it will continue to improve operating results in fiscal notwithstanding the increases in fiscal year and revenues and operating profit  for the foreseeable future  lanvision will need to continually assess its revenue prospects compared to its then current expenditure levels 
if it does not appear likely that revenues will increase  it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or raise cash through additional borrowings  the sale of assets  or other equity financing 
certain of these actions will require lender approval 
however  there can be no assurance lanvision will be successful in any of these efforts 
if it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses  this could have an adverse effect on future operating performance 
lanvision believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation anticipated from operations  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements during fiscal year to date  inflation has not had a material impact on lanvision s revenues or expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk lanvision currently invests its cash balances  in excess of its current needs  in approximately day commercial paper 
lanvision does not invest for the purposes of trading in securities  however  the portfolio is managed and invested for maximum return on the investments 
additionally  lanvision does not have any significant market risk exposure at january
