item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended march   and and the related notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
this discussion presented below reflects the restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal year see below and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this matter 
discontinued operations as conditions in the wool industry deteriorated throughout the fiscal year  we decided to close and dispose of certain of our wool operating units for strategic reasons in fiscal given the extremely difficult trading environment in the wool industry  we decided to shrink the wool division down to its core markets  namely  the key sourcing areas of australia  the key processing marketing areas of europe and the carpet and scoured sectors of the uk and it s subsidiary in chile  which has remained relatively healthy throughout the cyclical downturn we are in 
accordingly  in fiscal we discontinued operations in four of our wool operating units located in argentina  holland  new zealand and south africa 
we have identified these assets as held for sale and recorded the loss to discontinue these operations as million for fiscal year and million on a restated basis for fiscal the current year charge of million includes the operating loss and estimated closure sale costs of these operations for the year 
subsequent to the issuance of our financial statements for the year ended march   we discovered that the accounting records for our specialty fibers unit in holland had been falsified by local unit management to avoid disclosure of trading losses incurred in fiscal year as a result  we restated our financial statements to recognize these trading losses 
the net income effect of the restatement resulted in a decrease of million  net of taxes 
as described above and in note under the subheading  basis of presentation and reclassification  we disposed of our specialty fibers unit  as well as certain other non core wool operating units  and consequently the restatement is reflected in the results of discontinued operations for the prior year 
general we are principally engaged in purchasing  processing  storing  selling and shipping leaf tobacco 
we also purchase  process and sell various types of wool 
for both the tobacco and wool businesses  the ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices is an important element of profitability  although it is generally more important for wool than for tobacco because some customers pay us to purchase and process tobacco on a cost plus basis 
obtaining raw materials at favorable prices must be coupled with a thorough knowledge of the types and grades of raw materials to assure the profitability of processing and blending to a customer s specifications 
processing is capital intensive and profit depends on the volume of material processed and the efficiency of the factory operations 
due to the much larger number of dealers and customers for wool and the far more numerous trades involved  wool revenue tends to be more susceptible to market price fluctuations than tobacco 
historically  the cost of our materials  services and supplies has exceeded of revenues 
in the wool business  freight charges are also a significant element of the cost of sales 
the cost of raw materials  interest expense and certain processing and freight costs are variable and thus are related to the level of sales 
most procurement costs other than raw materials  certain processing costs  and most selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  are fixed 
the major elements of sg a are employee costs  including salaries  and marketing expenses 
tobacco purchases and sales are generally denominated in us dollars  whereas wool purchases and sales are typically denominated in the currency of the source country and destination country  respectively 
we regularly monitor our foreign exchange position and have not experienced material gains or losses on foreign exchange fluctuations 
we enter into forward contracts solely for the purpose of limiting our exposure to short term changes in foreign exchange rates 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at period end exchange rates 
the effects of these translation adjustments are reported in other comprehensive income loss 
exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and translation adjustments in countries with highly inflationary economies are included in net income 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from the estimates 
such differences could be material to our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition discontinued operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
a component of a business that is held for sale is reported in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be  or have been eliminated from the on going operations of the company and the company will not have any significant continuing involvement in such operations 
in the quarter ended march   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
accordingly our financial statements include certain wool units as discontinued operations 
while we believe our current estimates of discontinued operations liabilities are adequate  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
inventory 
we review inventories for changes in market value based on assumptions related to future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than our projections  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
we provide for the adjustments to lower of cost or market value through our valuation reserves which total and million at march  and  respectively 
income taxes 
we  through our subsidiaries  are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions 
we are subject to a tax audit in each jurisdiction in which our subsidiaries operate  which could result in changes in taxes 
for financial statement purposes  the tax benefit of net operating loss and credit carry forwards is recognized as a deferred tax asset  subject to appropriate valuation allowances when it is determined that recovery of the deferred tax asset is unlikely 
we evaluate the tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carry forwards on an ongoing basis 
these assumptions could be affected by changes in future taxable income and its sources and changes in us and foreign tax laws and rates 
our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
contingencies 
a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under generally accepted accounting principles  provisions for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against us 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or to derive a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of any possible loss in any particular quarterly or annual period or in the aggregate 
accordingly  no liability is currently recorded in the consolidated financial statements for such litigation 
retirement benefits 
we have pension and other postretirement benefit ie health care and life insurance costs and obligations that are dependent on assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trends  inflation  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for our judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
global market conditions a variety of external factors affected both the tobacco and wool markets worldwide during the fiscal year ended march  tobacco market conditions in general  the supply demand models for flue cured and burley styles of tobacco indicate a relatively balanced position globally 
there is still an oversupply condition for the oriental styles 
most of the oriental oversupply is held by the turkish monopoly 
in the united states  cigarette manufacturers began contracting in directly with tobacco farmers for their requirements  rather than purchasing tobacco at auction  and continue to do so 
consequently  our sales revenues have been and will be lower going forward 
however  we still process the tobacco in our facilities for which we receive processing revenue 
as a result  the trend toward direct purchasing by the cigarette manufactures has not had a material impact on our earnings because of the service income 
political and economic turmoil continues to affect the zimbabwe tobacco crop 
this has not had a material impact on our operations in this country 
the calendar crop is expected to be down from million kilos last year  to approximately to million kilos 
this crop is coming to market currently 
there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding future production 
it is widely believed that any shortfalls in the supply of flue cured leaf that may occur in zimbabwe can be offset by other markets  primarily brazil and argentina 
wool market conditions the global condition of the wool industry remains depressed 
even though production is projected to decline as a result of the prolonged drought in australia  which has led to reduced herd size  and the effects of the hoof and mouth disease epidemic  demand continues to be weak 
the prospect of lower supplies has pushed raw wool prices to record high levels 
however  the high prices are resulting in the end user markets  spinners and weavers  withdrawing or otherwise holding back from the market 
some consolidation is occurring within the industry  but overcapacity is still a concern 
china remains the dominant buyer in the current market 
wool is an easily substitutable product and manufacturers turned to alternative fibers in fiscal and until prices stabilize  the outlook remains depressed 
this is further impacted by the current low prices of other fibers  mainly cotton 
acquisitions and dispositions during fiscal year  we completed the purchase of the processing assets of export leaf tobacco  a subsidiary of brown and williamson tobacco company in the us 
as part of the purchase agreement  we entered into a long term processing contract for their us leaf requirements 
we also have begun construction of a leaf processing facility on a joint venture basis in indonesia that is expected to be completed in october both of these acquisitions were made with internally generated cash flows 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed one major acquisition 
in december  we finalized the purchase of the processing assets of nobleza picardo  a subsidiary of british american tobacco bat  in argentina 
as part of the purchase  we also signed a long term contract with nobleza for the processing of their argentine leaf requirements 
as noted above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we discontinued four wool operating units in fiscal the new zealand business was sold to a management led group and was finalized in december the south african processing facility was closed and the assets sold 
the sales company was sold to the existing management team 
the argentina unit and the tentler specialty fibers operation were closed and are in the process of final liquidation 
proceeds from these sales and closures were not material 
for the year ended march   we exited or exchanged ownership interest in two areas 
based on weak market fundamentals  we exited the tanzanian tobacco market 
all assets were sold and a net loss of million was recorded 
also in fiscal  the company traded its ownership interest in its greek subsidiary for the remaining ownership interest in its turkish operation 
this was accomplished for tax purposes  as a tax free exchange of assets subject to a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service of the us 
for financial statement purposes  the transaction was recorded at fair value 
consequently  we now own of the turkish subsidiary and have only a limited trading presence in greece 
recent accounting developments on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and disclosure requirements for most derivative instruments and hedge transactions involving derivatives 
sfas no 
also requires formal documentation procedures for hedging relationships and effectiveness testing when hedge accounting is to be applied 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 in the year ended march  we recorded a cumulative effect loss adjustment of million  net of applicable taxes  in other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of all derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments 
our derivative usage is principally foreign currency forwards 
these contracts typically have maturities of less than one year 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure 
our foreign currency forwards have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under the criteria of sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that changes in fair values of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges be recognized in other comprehensive income  while the ineffective portion of change in derivatives in fair value be recognized immediately in earnings 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of million and a fair value of million 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and the use of the pooling of interest method is no longer allowed 
sfas no 
requires upon adoption that the amortization of goodwill cease and the carrying value of goodwill be evaluated for impairment on a periodic basis 
we were required to implement sfas no 
during fiscal  which resulted in the discontinuance of approximately million of goodwill amortization 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition  the statement broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we early adopted sfas no 
during fiscal  and accordingly recognized as discontinued operations the results from four wool operating units that we targeted for sale in fiscal in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements  and  amendment to fasb statement  and technical corrections 
one of the major changes of this statement is to change the accounting for the classification of gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt 
upon adoption  we will follow apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions in determining whether such extinguishment of debt may be classified as extraordinary 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of fasb statement shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  we will adopt this statement in fiscal results of operations regional review of tobacco operations african region political and economic turmoil continues to impact the zimbabwe crop size  which is expected to continue to decrease from million kilos in crop year to between and million kilos in crop year the company s organization in zimbabwe has been restructured to reflect the decrease in zimbabwe s crop 
this situation has also led to an overall decrease of flue cured tobacco available on the world market 
customers have begun sourcing flue cured tobacco from other areas in the world  such as brazil 
the company s malawi operation primarily sources and processes burley tobaccos 
however  in response to the decrease in the zimbabwe crop size  the malawi operation is also pursuing various projects to grow the company s share of the expanding flue cured crop in malawi 
in addition  over the past several years  the company has developed additional sources of flue cured and burley tobacco in zambia and mozambique and those operations continue to be expanded 
these tobaccos are processed at the malawi factory  thereby providing economies of scale efficiencies for the malawi operation 
in kenya  the company had a successful first year in operating its own dark fired tobacco growing venture 
asian region the company continues to leverage its leading market positions in china  thailand and india in order to provide its customers with low cost  high quality tobacco 
the construction of a new processing facility in indonesia will also provide a high quality product  produced to international standards 
this joint venture is a partnership  based on long standing relationships  in which the company has a ownership  and is in direct response to customer s needs and is part of the company s asean strategies 
completion and start up of the facility is expected in october there have already been many positive indications of strong customer support 
european region for the upcoming crop year  the company s spanish operation has increased its sourcing of spanish tobacco by an estimated 
this will allow additional tobaccos to be offered to customers  as well as improving the cost structure through economies of scale benefits  which are expected to be achieved by the additional volumes processed 
volumes for the italian operation have increased by approximately 
these increases are mainly the result of contracting additional leaf tobaccos and increased volumes related to the toasted burley and blended strip facility  which is expected to come on line in july there has been a major shift in turkey as the result of the new turkish tobacco law 
the law makes it necessary for tobacco merchants to carry out direct contract buying with the farmers 
however  it no longer requires tekel  the turkish tobacco monopoly  to purchase excess stocks from the farmers as a means of a price support system 
throughout the european region  the strengthening euro versus the us dollar has had a significant impact on the cost of tobacco 
some us dollar based sales have underlying euro based costs  which shrinks the margins as the euro gains against the us dollar 
some of the increase is mitigated through increased us dollar prices to combat the increased costs due to exchange rate losses 
cis region the cres operation in russia faced increasing pressures to maintain its performance targets this year 
no growth occurred in the overall market and a new competitor has moved into the market place that has forced a reduction in volumes and gross margins 
the kyrgyzstan operation continues to increase the availability of tobaccos that it can source and sell to customers 
south american region in december  the company finalized the acquisition of a new processing facility in argentina 
during its second season of operations  customer support has grown and the argentine operation is making a strong contribution to net income this year 
in line with the company s worldwide iso certification program  and its commitment to producing quality tobaccos for customers  the argentine operation was recently iso certified 
brazil continues its solid contributions to net income 
there has been some transitioning by customers from the zimbabwe crop to the brazilian crop and this is expected to continue in fiscal north american region the usa tobacco market has become a predominantly domestic market 
for tobacco merchants  the us tobacco business has evolved into a processing operation for domestic cigarette manufacturers as most manufacturers in the united states are purchasing their tobacco directly from the farmers 
opportunities for tobacco export sales are limited due to the availability of lower cost  but similar quality  tobacco is available in other countries such as brazil 
the company s processing volume increased by approximately mainly as a result of acquiring an additional processing facility in april the company processes approximately one third of the total flue cured and burley tobacco grown in the usa 
comparison of the year ended march  to the year ended march  sales consolidated sales of million in fiscal were higher than the prior year 
sales for the tobacco division s operations for the twelve months ended march  increased by million to million 
overall  excluding the us market  tobacco unit volume was up 
increased sales in south america were driven by a full year inclusion of the acquisition of a tobacco processing facility in argentina in december and the continued increase in volumes sold from the brazilian operation 
in africa  sales revenue gains were achieved in kenya congo  malawi and south africa 
zimbabwe sales continue to decrease as the zimbabwe crop size shrinks as a result of the prolonged political and economic turmoil 
sales growth was also achieved in china  india  italy  spain  indonesia  thailand and canada 
sales declined in greece  turkey and in the value added processing units 
sales for the wool division were million  an increase of increase versus the prior year  driven mostly by higher wool prices in australia and higher volumes in the uk 
gross profit and cost of sales consolidated gross profits increased versus the prior year mainly due to the tobacco division s performance 
for tobacco  gross profit for the twelve month period of million was up from the prior period 
this was due primarily to the company s recent acquisition of tobacco processing facilities in the usa and argentina 
in addition to the sales gains noted above  improved mix and throughput efficiencies also led to gains in certain operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were up million compared to the prior year 
the increases in sg a are largely due to the million settlement of the deloach case in the us  the first full year of inclusion of the acquired processing facilities in the usa and argentina  the weaker us dollar  higher insurance  legal and professional expenses and normal inflationary increases 
these increases were partly offset by a million reduction in estimated costs of non us employee benefit plans 
interest expense and other income expense  net interest expense was lower due to reduced long term debt levels as a result of the company s debt buy back program and lower interest rates 
other income expense  net was higher than the prior year due to the recovery of a previously written off receivable and higher gains on asset sales and insurance proceeds 
income taxes  minority interest and equity in earnings of affiliates income tax charges or credits as a percentage of pretax income can vary due to differences in tax rates and relief available in areas where profits are earned or losses are incurred 
the effective tax rate was slightly lower than a year earlier 
equity in earnings of affiliates was higher than the prior year primarily due to the improved performance of the company s kyrgyzstan joint venture 
minority interest relates to the construction of the indonesia processing facility being undertaken by the company s new indonesia joint venture 
the completion and start up of the facility is expected to be in october income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations was million versus million in the prior year 
our tobacco division generated all of the improvement as conditions continued to improve and investments in key markets were brought fully on line 
key areas that improved were the us  brazil  argentina and thailand 
the tobacco division income from continuing operations was million versus million in the prior year 
for the remaining wool units  trading conditions remained difficult 
the loss from continuing operations was million  versus a loss of million in the prior year 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations was million for fiscal versus million for the prior year 
this expense includes the operating losses of the discontinued wool units up to the time these units were sold closed 
extraordinary item an extraordinary after tax income of  was recorded on the repurchase of over million face amount of long term debt 
this includes million of senior notes and million of the convertible subordinated debentures 
the prior year included a loss of million on the repurchase of debt 
net income consolidated net income was million an increase of over the prior year  which was heavily impacted by the decision to discontinue four wool operating units 
net income for the tobacco division was million  after extraordinary items  an increase of from the million net income for the twelve months ended march  the net loss for the remaining wool units was million versus million last year 
comparison of the year ended march  to the year ended march  sales 
sales from continuing operations for the months ended march  were million  down from a year earlier 
this reduction is due to the changes in the way us cigarette manufacturers now purchase the majority of their leaf supplies directly from the farmer 
we still perform handling and processing services for the leaf 
sales of million for the tobacco division were lower than the prior year as this is the first full year of the direct contracting by the manufacturers 
total volumes processed in the us were basically level with the prior year 
overall  excluding the us market  tobacco unit volume was up 
sales revenue increases in south america were driven by the addition of additional processing capacity in brazil and continued strong sales in our core business there 
in africa  sales revenue gains were achieved in kenya congo and zimbabwe 
sales gains were also achieved in china  italy and increases were recorded for canada 
sales in our cres operation in the cis were level with the prior year as that unit continues to operate at full capacity 
wool sales from continuing operations for the months ended march  of million were down from the prior year primarily as the result of continuing poor conditions in the global wool industry 
gross profit and cost of sales 
gross profit for the month period of million was up from the prior period 
this was due mostly to the sales gains noted above in the tobacco business  improved mix and throughput efficiencies 
this was partly offset by deterioration in the wool division gross profit due to higher prices and weak demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses were lower than the prior year as the prior year included expenses associated with exiting tanzania  current year cost cutting programs and lower headcount in our wool division 
interest expense and other income expense  net 
interest expense was lower due to reduced long term debt levels 
other income expense  net was million higher because the prior year included losses on sales of assets and investments related to exiting tanzania 
income taxes  minority interests and equity in earnings of affiliates 
income tax charges or credits as a percentage of pretax income can vary due to differences in tax rates and relief available in areas where profits are earned or losses are incurred 
the effective tax rate was lower than a year earlier  but remained high due mainly to losses in areas where tax relief is not available and the impact of hyperinflation on taxes in turkey 
there were no earnings attributed to minority interests in fiscal as fiscal was the last year of our minority partner structure in the greece and turkey markets 
equity in earnings of affiliates was down from the prior year primarily due to seasonal business factors 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations was million versus million in the prior year 
our tobacco division generated all of the improvement as conditions continued to improve and investments in key markets were brought fully on line 
key areas that improved were the us  brazil and thailand 
the tobacco division income from continuing operations was million versus million in the prior year 
for the remaining wool units  trading conditions remained difficult 
the loss from continuing operation was million  versus million profit in the prior year 
loss from discontinued operations 
the loss related to discontinued operations was million for fiscal and million for the prior year on a restated basis 
this expense includes the operating losses of the aforementioned units  estimated closure costs and the write off of associated foreign currency translation adjustments 
as noted above  we had early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and have reflected the exit from these businesses as discontinued operations 
extraordinary item 
an extraordinary after tax loss of million was recorded on the repurchase of over million face amount of long term debt 
this includes the call of million of senior notes at a call premium announced in february the prior year included the gain of million on the repurchase of debt in the open markets 
net income 
net income was million versus million for the months ended march  liquidity and capital expenditures working capital at march  was million  essentially unchanged from the million at march  increases in inventories and receivables stemming from the addition of new operations and increased sales were offset by increases in short term borrowings 
the company has used cash to repurchase long term debt 
the company continues to closely monitor its inventories  which fluctuate depending on seasonal factors and business conditions 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for related mostly to the purchase of a processing facility in the us  the construction of a new tobacco processing facility in indonesia and routine expenditures and construction of warehousing space in several areas 
capital expenditures for related mostly to routine expenditures in the tobacco and wool divisions  purchase of the tobacco processing assets in argentina  the completion of a second processing line in brazil and installation of a lanolin facility in the french wool operation 
we expect routine capital expenditures to total approximately million for the fiscal year ending march  for  cash provided by operating activities totaled million  primarily due to higher net income  and an increase in payables 
cash used for investing activities of million for included capital expenditures of million mostly for tobacco activities including million in brazil  million in the united states  million in africa and million for the wool division 
financing arrangements 
we incur short term debt to finance our seasonal working capital needs  which typically peak in the third quarter  under secured lines of credit with several banks 
at march   total available short term credit facilities for continuing operations was million  compared to million at march   with million versus million in being utilized for letters of credit and guarantees and million was unused in versus million in on august   our major tobacco subsidiaries entered into a revolving bank facility 
the facility provides for borrowings of million for working capital and other general corporate purposes  and the interest rate on borrowings under the facility is subject to change depending on our financial performance 
the rate is currently libor plus 
the borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by the company and certain of our tobacco subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrowing subsidiaries and a pledge of all of the capital stock of the subsidiaries not otherwise pledged to secure other obligations 
on may   the amount of the facility was increased from million to million and the maturity date was extended from july  to july  in fiscal  this facility was increased to million with the addition of two banks 
terms of the facility were unchanged 
on june   our major tobacco subsidiaries amended their revolving bank credit facility 
the facility was decreased from million to million and the maturity date was extended to july  from july  financial covenants and other terms and conditions were essentially unchanged 
on august   our major tobacco subsidiaries amended their revolving bank credit facility 
the facility was decreased from million to million and the maturity date was extended to july  from july  financial covenants and other terms and conditions were essentially unchanged 
additionally  as of march   local lines were available for the remainder of the tobacco division of approximately million in addition to separate facilities for the wool division of million 
on november   we issued million of our convertible subordinated debentures  which are due march  the debentures are currently convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends of 
the debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all senior indebtedness 
as of march   the debentures became redeemable in whole or in part at our option 
beginning march   we are obligated to make annual sinking fund payments sufficient to retire at least of the principal amount of issued debentures reduced by earlier conversions  redemptions and repurchases 
holders of the debentures have the right to demand redemption under certain conditions  including a change in control of our company  mergers and consolidations and distributions with respect to our capital stock 
we may elect to redeem debentures under these circumstances for common stock in lieu of cash 
in fiscal  we repurchased million of these notes at an after tax gain of million 
in fiscal  we purchased an additional million of these debentures at an after tax gain of million 
in fiscal  we repurchased an additional million of these debentures near par value 
the after tax gain of million is classified as an extraordinary item in the income statement consistent with the statement of financial accounting standard due to these repurchases  the sinking fund requirements noted above have been satisfied in full 
on august   our us tobacco subsidiary consummated the sale and issuance of million of senior notes 
the notes are due in in fiscal  we repurchased called a total of million of the notes 
the net loss after tax on the repurchase of these notes was million and is included in the extraordinary items 
in fiscal  we repurchased an additional million of these notes at prices slightly below par value 
the write off of associated issue expenses resulted in an after tax loss of thousand  which was classified as an extraordinary item in the income statement 
our contractual obligations  excluding long term debt  are outlined in note to our financial statements and consist mostly of lease payments for facilities that in the aggregate are not material amounts 
additionally  we make advances to suppliers that will be repaid by delivery of tobacco at the end of the respective growing season and are a routine feature of our business in certain parts of the world 
the maximum amount of advances outstanding during the last fiscal year was million 
based on the outlook for the business for the next months  we anticipate that we will be able to service the interest and principal on our indebtedness  maintain adequate working capital and provide for capital expenditures out of operating cash flow and available borrowings under our credit facilities 
our future operating performance will be subject to economic conditions and to financial  political  agricultural and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
debt agreements to which our subsidiaries and we are parties contain financial covenants  which could restrict the payment of cash dividends 
under the most restrictive covenant  we had approximately million of retained earnings available for distribution as dividends at march  tax and repatriation matters our subsidiaries and we are subject to income tax laws in each of the countries in which we do business 
we make a comprehensive review of the income tax requirements of each of our operations  file appropriate returns and make appropriate income tax provisions 
these are determined at the individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
we provide valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for our subsidiaries that have a history of losses 
we cannot assert that there will likely be sufficient profits generated by these subsidiaries in the near future to offset these losses 
we follow these processes using an appropriate combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are not subject to additional foreign income taxes nor considered to be subject to us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
we intend to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely  accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
we regularly review the status of the accumulated earnings of each of our us and foreign subsidiaries as part of our overall financing plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange and interest rates 
we actively monitor these exposures 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into derivative financial instruments 
the objective is to reduce  where we deem appropriate  fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
because we use currency rate sensitive instruments to hedge only existing transactions  any loss in value for those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of those hedged transactions 
we do not hold or issue any significant derivative financial instruments for trading or speculation purposes 
foreign exchange rates we are exposed to foreign exchange movements 
consequently  we enter into various contracts  primarily for the wool division  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to preserve the value of commitments and anticipated transactions 
we use foreign currency contracts to hedge revenue streams and raw material purchases 
as of march   we had short term forward exchange contracts with us dollar equivalents of million notional value and million current fair value 
interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in our total debt portfolio 
a one percentage point change in interest rates would increase our interest cost by approximately million 
substantially all of our long term borrowings are denominated in us dollars and carry fixed interest rates 
the use of derivative financial instruments did not had a material impact on our financial position at march  and or our results of operations or cash flows for the years ended march    and
