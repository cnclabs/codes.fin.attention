item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
all statements that address expectations or projections about the future  including statements about the company s strategy for growth  product development  market position  expenditures and financial results  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors  including but not limited to the following the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives more than half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region  social  political or labor conditions in a specific country or region  or potential adverse foreign tax consequences 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations 
because the company derives more than half its revenues from outside the united states  its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings and results of operations could be adversely affected if the united states dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  gain market acceptance of new products  or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
as with any pharmaceutical under development  there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review 
there are no guarantees that products will receive regulatory approvals or prove to be commercially successful 
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of purchased components and materials due to market demand  currency exchange risks  shortages and other factors 
the company depends on various components and materials for the manufacturing of its products 
although the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials  it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand  currency risks  or shortages  or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
the possibility that acquisitions  divestitures and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations 
as part of the company s strategy for growth  the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions  divestitures and strategic alliances 
however  there can be no absolute assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company 
the company is the subject of various legal proceedings 
the current estimates of the potential impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows for its legal proceedings and claims are predictions made by the company about the future and should be considered forward looking statements 
these estimates could change in the future 
for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company  see the discussion of legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting estimates as stated in our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings  potential asset impairment issues  and the company s pension and postretirement obligations 
legal proceedings the company s core activities relate to the development  manufacture and sale of thousands of products to numerous markets 
while this risk dispersion provides a measure of overall stability  it also results in legal risks in some areas 
the company records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability probably will arise 
the company also records receivables for the probable amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company s insurance program in those instances 
the company cannot always definitively determine possible liabilities that exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to which it is a party 
there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges  whether related to products liability  antitrust  or other litigation  environmental matters  or other actions  in excess of presently recorded liabilities 
however  the company believes it unlikely  based upon the nature of the legal proceedings and its current knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances  that the possible liabilities exceeding recorded amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
known legal risks include the ultimate collection of breast implant insurance receivables a matter currently in dispute with the company s insurance carriers  respirator mask asbestos insurance receivables collection and probable liabilities  and an outstanding lawsuit filed by lepage s incorporated that extends back to summary amounts concerning the breast implant and respirator mask asbestos litigation follow 
at december millions breast implant receivables breast implant liabilities respirator mask asbestos receivables respirator mask asbestos liabilities at december   the company has accrued receivables of million relating to breast implants 
of this million  million represents settled but yet to be received amounts  while million has been contested by insurance carriers 
the company believes that it is likely to obtain relief in the minnesota supreme court 
if the minnesota supreme court does not grant relief as anticipated  the company could be effectively deprived of significant and potentially material insurance coverage for breast implant claims 
as part of the company s efforts to recover the amounts contested by the insurance carriers  the company also initiated an arbitration proceeding in london  england  to recover insurance coverage for breast implant liability and costs from claims made insurance carriers 
the arbitration hearing will first consider whether the policy provides insurance coverage for the company s breast implant liability and costs 
if the panel favorably decides the coverage question for the company  it will then determine the amount of coverage in a subsequent hearing later in the company s remaining respirator mask asbestos liability is million at december  this estimate represents the company s best estimate of its liability 
if amounts are paid in settlement of claims or if any damages are ultimately assessed against the company in current or future litigation  a substantial portion of such amounts is expected to be covered by the company s product liability insurance 
various factors could affect the timing and amount of proceeds to be received under the company s various insurance policies  including i the timing of payments made in settlement of claims  ii delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers  and iii the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future 
there can be no certainty that the company will collect all amounts recorded as being probable of recovery from its insurers 
m has not recorded any liability for the lepage s incorporated litigation as of december  m expects to prevail in this litigation  but if m does not prevail  m would incur a pre tax charge of approximately million 
m would also be potentially liable for lepage s attorneys fees and costs 
potential asset impairment issues there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these long term estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge  such risk is mitigated by management s ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period 
m has approximately billion of goodwill that  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
a portion of this goodwill approximately million is in m s telecommunications business  which the company believes will maintain its value 
however  if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended period of time  it could create future impairment losses 
pension and postretirement obligations pension expense impacted earnings by cents per diluted share compared with pension expense of cents per diluted share in the company expects pension expense to increase approximately another cents per diluted share in  largely attributed to unrecognized losses on pension assets related to equity market weakness the last few years 
in accounting for pension and postretirement benefits  costs and related liabilities are developed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the united states pension plan expense calculation for  the company s long term rate of return on asset assumption remains at percent and its year end discount rate assumption is percent which is used for expense calculations  which represents a half percentage point reduction from the year end discount rate 
the discount rate decrease is consistent with changes in high quality long term corporate bond indices 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans approximately percent equity securities and percent fixed income  past performance  and other factors 
estimates and assumptions concerning the company s pension and postretirement obligations and related periodic cost can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
material changes in pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes in the discount rates  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to these plans and other factors 
a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact m s pension expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return would impact m s pension expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that the company s consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  achievement of corporate growth objectives  changes in material costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
operating results overview net income totaled billion  or per diluted share  compared with billion  or per diluted share  in  and billion  or per diluted share  in in the first half of  net income was impacted by non recurring charges of million  or cents per diluted share  related to the company s restructuring program that was approved in june in  currency effects reduced earnings by cents per diluted share  while the adoption of a new accounting standard resulting in the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived intangible asset amortization increased earnings by cents per diluted share

additional details concerning non recurring items follow 
non recurring items in january  the securities and exchange commission issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures a rule directed by the sarbanes oxley act of this rule requires public companies that disclose or release non gaap financial measures to include the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  to provide a reconciliation of the disclosed non gaap measure to the most comparable gaap measure  and requires companies to furnish earnings releases or similar announcements to the commission on form k 
this rule will apply to all subject disclosures as of march  the rule also provides guidance on what constitutes non recurring  infrequent  or unusual as applied to specific financial transactions or events 
the company currently provides reconciliations of its disclosed non gaap financial reporting to the most comparable gaap financial reporting 
in addition to regulation g  the sec amended item of regulation s k to provide additional guidance to registrants that include non gaap financial measures in sec filings 
this guidance would prohibit the presentation of certain non gaap financial measures that exclude from reported results non recurring  infrequent or unusual items when the nature of the charge or gain is such that is it reasonably likely to recur within two years or there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years 
this guidance could result in changes in the company s future presentation of non gaap financial measures

pro forma amounts excluding non recurring items the company believes that discussion of results excluding significant non recurring items provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends 
the pro forma amounts which exclude non recurring items that follow are not in accordance with  or preferable to  amounts determined in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles

six sigma focuses on higher growth  lower costs and greater cash flow 
global sourcing effectiveness generates savings through buying smarter  managing supply agreements  geographic broadening and e applications 
m acceleration reallocates research and development resources to larger  more global projects 
indirect cost reduction focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with products or services 
in eproductivity  m believes it has a significant digitization opportunity 
the company estimates that these initiatives provided a combined benefit on a pre tax basis of more than million in in  the company estimates these initiatives could contribute on a pre tax basis an additional million compared to there can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
numerous factors may create offsets to these savings  such as the potential for continued weakness in sales volumes  normal increases in compensation and benefits  and other inflationary pressures

financial instruments the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure  interest rate risks and commodity price risks 
a financial risk management committee  composed of senior management  provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities 
this committee determines the company s financial risk policies and objectives  and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization 
this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation  risk analysis  counterparty credit approval  and ongoing monitoring and reporting 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts  options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions 
the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  the company may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts  price protection swaps and forward physical contracts 
a variance co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a percent confidence level over a month time horizon 
based on this analysis of the company s interest rate risks  possible changes in interest rates would not adversely impact after tax earnings by a material amount million at december   and million at december  
based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks  possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by million million at december  
in  the actual currency impact did not exceed the value at risk after tax amount of million 
this model analyzed more than different currencies  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
the company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales  which will move costs outside the united states 
this will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations 
in  the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings 
however  this hedging program will not make m immune to currency impacts 
sensitivity analysis was used to assess commodity risks 
the technique used evaluates the effect that changes in the market value of commodities will have on the company s commodity derivative instruments 
at year end and  the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments  assuming a percent adverse change in the underlying commodity price  was not material million after tax at december   and million after tax at december  
the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
derivative instruments are used to partially hedge about one percent of this exposure 
the global energy exposure is such that a percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
derivative instruments are used to partially hedge about percent of this energy exposure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the context of item a  market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices  such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
