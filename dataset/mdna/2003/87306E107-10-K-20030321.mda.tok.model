item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
t was incorporated in october  but did not engage in business activities until the acquisition of cor val  inc on february  we acquired preferred industries  inc on april  for financial reporting purposes  t was deemed the accounting acquirer of both cor val and preferred industries and applied the purchase method of accounting in both acquisitions 
in this annual report on form k  we sometimes refer to cor val and preferred industries together as the predecessors 
the results of operations of the predecessors are included in our operating results from their respective dates of acquisition 
during the year  we acquired five operating companies in transactions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
on february   we acquired cor val for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
on april   we acquired preferred industries for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
on april   we acquired o m equipment  inc for approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed and a maximum earnout of million based on the performance of o m through million was earned in  million was earned in  and million was earned in 
additionally  we acquired control products of louisiana  inc and coastal electric motors  inc 
in september and december  respectively  for total consideration of approximately million in cash  plus liabilities assumed 
the results of operations of these companies have been included in our operating results from the dates of acquisition 
on may   simultaneous with the signing of the merger agreement with ihi  we acquired a b bolt  a subsidiary of ihi  for million in cash including expenses in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of operations of a b bolt have been included in our operating results from the date of acquisition 
on december   t energy services  inc  a private delaware corporation former t  merged into ihi  with ihi surviving the merger 
in connection with the merger  the combined company was reincorporated in delaware under the name t energy services  inc and implemented a one for ten reverse stock split of its common stock 
the merger was treated for accounting purposes as a purchase of ihi by former t a reverse acquisition in a purchase business transaction 
the purchase method of accounting requires that we carry forward former t s net assets at their historical book values and reflect ihi s net assets at their estimated fair market values  with any excess of the fair market value of the purchase consideration in excess of the fair market value of ihi s identifiable net assets treated as goodwill 
the historical financial data presented in this annual report on form k includes the historical financial condition and operating results of t prior to its merger with ihi 
for the year  the historical financial data also includes the two weeks of operations of the combined company from december  to december  as part of the merger with ihi  we acquired a non energy subsidiary 
because the subsidiary s operations are outside our strategic focus  at the time of the merger  we identified this operation as one to be sold 
the sale was completed in july on december   our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market under the new symbol ttes 
in addition  our class b warrants  class c warrants and class d warrants began trading on the over the counter bulletin board under the new symbols ttesz  ttesl  and ttesw  respectively these class b  class c and class d warrants expired january  
immediately after the merger  first reserve fund viii  lp first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  and collectively all of the former t shareholders including first reserve owned approximately of our common shares  with the remaining of our common shares being held by the shareholders of ihi immediately prior to the merger 
before the closing and as part of the merger  ihi divested of substantially all of its non energy related subsidiaries  sjmb  lp converted million of its ihi debt into shares of ihi common stock  first reserve converted million of its former t debt into shares of former t common stock  and first reserve purchased an additional million in shares of former t common stock 
in addition  the combined company completed a refinancing of its senior debt simultaneously with the closing of the merger 
under the terms of the merger  all but two of ihi s then existing directors and all of its officers resigned their positions with the combined company  and the management of former t and six of former t s director designees assumed the management and director duties for the combined company 
our financial statements for the year ended december  reflect operations for the ten month period from march  the date the company commenced business operations to december  our results of operations for the year ended december  are not comparable to the results of operations for the comparable periods for each of the predecessor companies because t was not engaged in business operations prior to march   t made three acquisitions during the year in addition to the predecessors which are not reflected for the full period  and the historical information presented for the predecessors does not reflect the purchase accounting adjustments recorded by t critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment and estimates are described below 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount  net of write offs and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our receivables are exposed to concentrations of credit risk since a majority of our business is conducted with companies in the oil and gas  petrochemical  chemical and petroleum refining industries in the gulf coast region 
we continually monitor collections and evaluate the financial strength of our customers but do not require collateral to support our customer receivables 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential collection issues in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is no longer probable 
we cannot give assurances that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past or that our losses will not exceed the amount reserved 
inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and slow moving inventory to write down the recorded cost of inventory to its fair market value 
this analysis is based primarily on the length of time the item has remained in inventory and management s consideration of current and expected market conditions 
however  a significant decrease in demand and a further weakening of market conditions could result in further writedowns in inventory carrying values and a charge to earnings 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used by us are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and represents a significant portion of our assets 
identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair market value at the date of acquisition 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard changes the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
the standard also requires a reassessment of the useful lives of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill and at least an annual test for impairment of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives 
in  the company completed the transitional goodwill and indefinite life intangibles impairment tests and the annual test required by sfas no 
and recorded no impairments of its goodwill and indefinite life intangibles based on these fair value tests 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually using the fair value criteria prescribed by sfas no 
fair value was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies  which are significantly influenced by management s assumptions as to future cash flows  and market comparable information 
we will continue to test on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual impairment tests that would more likely than not reduce fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value

in addition  sales were positively influenced by increases in the worldwide rig count  optimism regarding the long term hydrocarbon price environment  increased worldwide demand for oil and gas coupled with declining production in many areas 
the factors resulted in increased oil and gas prices  increased exploration and production spending and an improved demand for oilfield services in the first three quarters of sales for the products segment increased million in from million in this sales increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of coastal electric motors  inc in december and the inclusion of a full year s sales in the period along with million of sales generated from the acquired ihi entities in december sales for the distribution segment for were million

historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for debt service  capital expenditures  working capital and acquisition financing  and our principal sources of liquidity and cash have been from cash flows from operations  borrowings under long term debt arrangements and issuances of equity securities 
we have financed acquisitions through bank borrowings  sales of equity primarily to first reserve and internally generated funds

principal debt instruments 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million borrowed under our principal bank credit facility and other bank financings 
as of december   we had million in availability under our revolving credit facility 
however  as a result of the funded debt to ebitda ratio covenant  as defined in the credit agreement  our availability was limited to million 
on december   we entered into a senior credit facility with wells fargo  na and general electric capital corporation maturing december  concurrently  we entered into a million subordinated term loan with wells fargo energy capital  inc maturing december  the senior credit facility includes a revolving credit facility of the lesser of a defined borrowing base based upon of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventory or million  a term loan of million and an optional facility for up to an additional million in the form of a revolving credit commitment for future acquisitions based upon specific criteria 
the senior credit facility s term loan is payable in equal quarterly installments of million 
the applicable interest rate of the senior credit facility is governed by our trailing twelve month funded debt to ebitda ratio and ranges from prime plus or libor plus to prime plus or libor plus 
at december   the senior credit facility bore interest at libor plus  with interest payable quarterly 
we are required to prepay the senior credit facility under certain circumstances with the net cash proceeds of asset sales  insurance proceeds  equity issuances and institutional debt  and commencing april  if  and for so long as  our funded debt to ebitda ratio is to or greater  with of excess cash flow as determined under the senior credit agreement

we also believe any significant increase in capital expenditures caused by any need to increase manufacturing capacity can be funded from operations or through debt financing 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates  but the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings  including the unborrowed portion of our senior credit facility or new debt issuances  but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with an acquisition 
however  acquisition funds may not be available at terms acceptable to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we are exposed to some market risk due to the floating interest rate under our revolving credit facility and certain of our term debt 
as of december   our revolving credit facility had no principal balance and our variable long term debt had a principal balance of million  with interest rates that float with prime or libor 
a increase in interest rates could result in a million annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances
