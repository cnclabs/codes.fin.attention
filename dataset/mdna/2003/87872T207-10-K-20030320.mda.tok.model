item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview revenues in were impacted by economic uncertainties and weakness in the united states and global economies 
as a result  demand for information technology services  such as those we provide  was adversely impacted 
we expect that these general economic uncertainties and weaknesses may continue throughout and perhaps beyond 
we expect quarterly revenues before reimbursements in early to decline as compared to the fourth quarter of we believe that a recovery in our industry is not likely to occur until improvement in the general economy strengthens the technology market in which we operate 
in order to provide possible new revenue streams  we are initiating two new business offerings in service and support offerings in the local  state and federal government segments of the domestic systems integration market and the performance economic institute which is a subscription based research program that focuses on best practices in business operations and execution and can allow us to conduct meaningful executive level conversations as well as build new downstream integration business 
we expect to spend over million in the first quarter of on these initiatives 
the results of our operations are affected by general economic conditions as well as the level of economic activity and change in the industries that we serve 
our business is also driven by the pace of technological change and the type and level of spending by our clients in the areas in which we provide services 
many factors can result in a deferral  reduction or cancellation of services requested by our prospective or current clients including budget constraints  economic conditions and perceived project progress  success or value 
during such periods of decreased demand  pricing pressures emerge as companies try to minimize costs and negotiate lower prices for our services 
our ability to successfully identify and prepare for these changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 
therefore  our strategy is to try to anticipate these trends and identify cost management initiatives that will allow us to manage costs relative to expected revenues 
in addition  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from large projects for a limited number of clients 
accordingly  the loss of a significant client could adversely impact our revenues and financial position 
project personnel costs constitute the majority of our operating costs 
since project personnel costs are driven primarily by the cost of billable personnel  mainly compensation and benefits  maintaining these costs at a reasonable and predictable percentage of revenue is critical to our financial performance 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues are driven by utilization and average hourly billing rates 
utilization represents the percentage of our billable professionals time spent on billable work 
it is our strategy to try to match our project personnel supply with demand 
at times this requires us to reduce headcount and reassign employees to other active projects when they are no longer needed on a particular project 
however  because of the mix of skills needed and project duration  implementation of this strategy may be delayed at times 
accordingly  any decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in page 
table of contents staffing  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in revenues  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management believes that judgement and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition estimating the allowance for doubtful receivables accounting for income taxes these policies are discussed further in this section under revenues  bad debt expense and income taxes 
segments during  we were organized into two business segments  digital enterprise consulting and peer in  we terminated the investment in and closed our peer software development operation within the peer segment and now we report entirely within one business segment 
revenues we derive our revenues from a variety of information technology services  including systems integration  packaged software integration and implementation services  programming  training and extended support services 
for most of our engagements  we recognize revenues on contracts on a time and materials basis as work is performed primarily based on hourly billing rates 
for our limited number of fixed price contracts which require senior executive and or board level approval  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  which is based on the percentage of work performed in the period compared to the total estimated work to be performed over the entire contract 
revenues are subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
any revisions in the estimate are charged to operations in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
contracts are performed in phases 
losses on contracts  if any  are reserved in full when determined 
contract losses are determined by the amount by which the estimated cost of the contract exceeds the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
extended support revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
in  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred which requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses be characterized as revenue 
prior to adopting eitf issue no 
 out of pocket expenses were presented net of amounts billed to clients 
with the adoption of eitf issue no 
 out of pocket expenses reimbursable expenses are now shown as a separate component of revenues and costs and expenses 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not affect our reported net income or loss 
page 
table of contents costs and expenses project personnel project personnel costs consist primarily of professional salaries and benefits 
other project expenses other project expenses consist of the cost for subcontractors hired for use on our client projects as well as nonbillable expenses incurred for client projects and business development 
nonbillable expenses include recruiting fees  certain selling expenses  personnel training and  in periods prior to the termination of the peer software development operation in  software development costs 
reimbursable expenses reimbursable expenses represent project related and other out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the client 
an equivalent amount is included in revenues under the caption reimbursements 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we also analyze our note receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  on a client by client basis  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
management and administrative support management and administrative support costs consist of practice area costs and infrastructure costs 
practice area costs include practice area management  support personnel  marketing costs and recruiting costs 
infrastructure costs include senior corporate management  accounting  financial reporting  finance  tax  legal  treasury  human resources  employee benefits  marketing  public and investor relations  office operations  recruiting  training  internal communications  internal technology applications  planning  quality assurance  and risk management 
incentive compensation incentive compensation is accrued at a set percentage of base salary  which varies by level of employee  and adjusted to reflect the amounts needed for active employees and for performance against targets  goals and objectives 
payments of incentive compensation  if any  are performance based and are determined by both objective financial based and subjective measures 
these objectives include both quarterly and full fiscal year parameters 
page 
table of contents income taxes we use an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided using currently enacted tax rates when tax laws and financial accounting standards differ with respect to the amount of income for a year and the basis of assets and liabilities 
we do not provide us deferred income taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are expected to be indefinitely reinvested 
judgement is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not provided a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that they will be fully utilized 
while we have considered future taxable income in determining whether these deferred tax assets will be fully utilized  should actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance 
this resulting valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we must also estimate our current tax exposure for situations where taxing authorities would assert tax positions different then those taken by us 
such reserves are routinely reviewed and adjusted when required to reflect changes in estimates based upon factors  such as changes in tax laws  results of tax authority reviews and statutory limitations 
compared with revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from revenues before reimbursements decreased percent to million from million 
we believe that this decline in revenues was primarily due to decreased demand arising out of the continuing economic uncertainties and a decline in corporate information technology capital expenditures as large and small companies reassessed their goals and budgets

we added new clients and new projects during compared to new clients and new projects in costs and expenses project personnel costs were million in  a decrease of percent from this decrease was largely attributable to staff and salary reductions driven by our ongoing efforts to keep headcount and costs in line with associated demand for our services  as described earlier in this item 
part of the headcount reductions resulted from an increase in annualized voluntary turnover to percent from percent 
project personnel costs as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements increased to percent for from percent for primarily due to a decline in average hourly billing rates 
average hourly billing rates decreased percent to the decline in hourly billing rates reflects the increased competitive environment in the information technology consulting market 
partially offsetting the decline in hourly billing rates was an improvement in staff utilization  which increased to percent from percent 
we continue to try to align our headcount to reflect anticipated decreases in demand for our services 
page 
table of contents other project expenses were million in  a decrease of percent from the decrease in other project expenses consisted of the following a decrease in headcount related costs of million  which included hiring  training  computer and communication costs  a decrease in business development costs of million  such as  travel  sales commissions and practice area development costs  and a decrease in various other costs of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the severance provision of million 
this increase mainly related to the severance of approximately employees in connection with our ongoing efforts to align our headcount with anticipated demand for our services 
other project expenses as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements increased slightly to percent for from percent for as a result of an increase in the severance provision mentioned above 
bad debt expense was million for compared to million for the higher bad debt expense in was largely attributable to financial problems at several clients 
management and administrative support costs decreased to million for from million in this decrease included the following a decrease in non peer labor costs of million as we reduced headcount and salaries as a result of our cost management initiatives  a decrease in non peer travel costs of million as a result of the decrease in headcount as well as our implementation of more effective cost controls  a decrease of million from the closure of the peer software development operations  and a decrease in various other costs  such as communication  marketing and computer expenses  of million due to reduced headcount and our implementation of cost controls 
there was no goodwill amortization during goodwill amortization of million for related to coursenet systems  inc coursenet which was acquired in during  we closed our peer software development operations and recorded a goodwill impairment charge relative to the coursenet goodwill 
as a result  we had no goodwill on the balance sheet as of december  or during  we reversed restructuring and other charges of million 
this amount consisted of million from the non peer severance related costs recorded in as more fully described below and million related to certain lease terminations recorded in during  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges comprised of million relating to the closure of our peer software development operation and million in non peer severance related costs 
as previously discussed  this charge for non peer costs was reduced by million to million during the following tables provide the components of these charges

the accrued amounts were paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 
if employees meet their quarterly quantitative and qualitative objectives  we expect to continue to accrue incentive compensation in operating income loss consolidated operating income was million for compared to a consolidated operating loss of million for our operating income for included restructuring and other credits of million 
excluding these credits  we would have had operating income of million 
our operating loss for included restructuring and other charges of million 
excluding these charges  we would have had an operating loss of million 
the improvement in operating income  excluding restructuring and other credits charges  was mainly due to the reduction in bad debt expense 
page 
table of contents other income and expense other income and expense for was million compared to million for  a decrease of percent 
the decrease is a result of lower interest rates during compared to our cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in overnight money market type accounts 
average interest rates were approximately percent in compared to approximately percent in income tax provision our effective tax rate for was percent compared to a tax benefit of percent for the effective tax rate for exceeded the federal rate mainly as a result of state income taxes 
the tax benefit for was less than the federal statutory rate mainly due to nondeductible goodwill  partially offset by state tax benefits on the loss for the period 
shares outstanding weighted average number of common shares outstanding and weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased due to the significant repurchase of some of our outstanding shares under our previously announced repurchase program as well as a reduction in the dilutive effect of common equivalent shares due to a decline in our stock price 
during under the share repurchase program  we repurchased  shares at an average price of per share compared to  shares at an average price of per share in compared with revenues consolidated net revenues were million for  a decrease of percent from revenues before reimbursements were million for  a decrease of percent from we believed that this decline in revenue was primarily due to negative economic conditions throughout however other factors played a role in the decline  including a decline in corporate information technology capital expenditures as large and small companies reassessed their goals and budgets

notwithstanding this reduction  project personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues before reimbursements were percent for versus percent for  mainly due to a lower utilization during the first half of utilization was percent over the first half of compared to percent throughout the staff reductions taken during improved page 
table of contents utilization during the second half of partially offsetting the lower utilization was an increase in average hourly billing rates  which increased percent to in other project expenses were million for  a decrease of percent from this decrease was mainly due to improved company wide cost controls  reduced travel costs associated with lower average headcount  decreased international expenditures  and reduced software development costs as a result of the closure of our peer software development operation

bad debt expense was million for compared to million for this increase was largely attributable to financial problems at several clients 
management and administrative support costs were million for  a decrease of percent 
this decrease consisted of a decrease in practice area management and administrative costs of million  offset by an increase in infrastructure costs of million 
the decrease in practice area management and administrative costs of million included decreases in selling and marketing expenses and recruiting costs 
in tsc and eloyalty entered into a shared services agreement pursuant to which tsc provided to eloyalty certain administrative services 
we charged these services to eloyalty and  as a result  net infrastructure costs were reduced by million during the shared services agreement was not in effect in and  accordingly  there was no such offset during however  the infrastructure cost base was reduced by million in  excluding amounts billed to eloyalty 
this decrease included a reduction in domestic office costs  corporate marketing expenses and internal systems and human resources areas 
goodwill amortization of million was recorded in compared to million for these amounts were in addition to the million goodwill impairment charge that was recorded during for the closure of our peer software development operations as discussed further in this item 
as a result of this impairment charge  we had no goodwill on the balance sheet as of december  during  we recorded million in restructuring and other charges comprised of million relating to the closure of our peer software development operation and million in non peer severance related costs  as more fully described earlier in this item 
during  we also reversed restructuring and other charges of million related to certain lease terminations recorded in during  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million for the closure of our latin american operations 
subsequent to the recording of the charge we collected million of accounts receivables previously written off and  as a result  the cumulative charge was reduced to million in as of december   we had used million of this charge for cash payments of million related to the severance costs for approximately employees  lease terminations and professional fees and million in net asset write offs

excluding these charges and credits  our operating loss for was million compared to a loss of million for this increase in operating loss was mainly due to an increase in the bad debt expense and the decline in revenues  offset by a decrease in other project expenses 
other income and expense other income and expense for was million compared to million for this decrease is a result of lower interest rates and average cash and cash equivalent balances throughout as compared to our cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in overnight money market type accounts

shares outstanding weighted average number of common shares outstanding and weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased due to significant purchases of our stock under our previously announced stock repurchase program  offset by the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares under the company s employee stock purchase plan

table of contents liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for was mainly due to accounts receivable collections offset by bonus and k match payments made during the first quarter 
these payments resulted in a decrease in accrued compensation and related costs 
the accounts receivable collections contributed to improved days sales outstanding during the period 
days sales outstanding improved by days to days at december  compared to december  in addition  during we wrote off million of previously reserved accounts receivable which resulted in a decline in the allowance for doubtful receivables and we reclassified a million net receivable from current to non current due to the estimated timing of receipt based on pending litigation 
estimated future cash commitments include various office facilities  property and office equipment under operating leases and other costs that expire at various dates 
the minimum cash commitments under these non cancelable operating leases and other obligations with terms in excess of one year are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in in addition  we have a minimum annual commitment for telecommunications of million in the company has no guarantees of third party debt as of december   nor any other off balance sheet commitments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for for capital expenditures 
we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was million for during we purchased  shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program for million and received million from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 
our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and anticipated operating cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at december  was million 
we believe that these sources are sufficient to meet our current cash requirements 
our investment policy is to maintain most of our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  large money market type funds 
this policy exposes us to short term interest rate fluctuations 
operating results and liquidity  including our ability to raise additional capital if necessary  may be materially and adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the company s services 
while it is our strategy to reduce costs in order to match our capacity with demand  this may not achieve the necessary cost savings 
in addition  a number of other factors  including changes in general economic conditions  technological changes  competition  and the suspension or cancellation of a large project could have an adverse effect on future results and liquidity 
these aforementioned factors  as well as other factors  are discussed further in this section under assumptions underlying certain forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results 
we have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan 
all company executives defined as vice presidential level and above are eligible to participate in this voluntary program  which permits page 
table of contents participants to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation 
we hold deferred amounts in a rabbi trust for the benefit of plan participants and investment earnings or losses are credited to the participants accounts based on investment allocation options selected by the participants 
we do not guarantee these investments or earnings thereon 
these investments remain assets of the company and are available to the general creditors of the company in the event of our insolvency 
we have a million unsecured line of credit facility the facility with bank of america national trust and savings association bank of america 
the agreement expires march  we have never borrowed against the facility and accordingly  we have chosen not to renew the facility upon its expiration 
at our election  loans made under the facility bear interest at either the bank of america reference rate or the applicable eurodollar interest rate plus percent 
the unused line fee is percent of the unused portion of the commitment 
the facility requires  among other things  that we maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial ratio requirements 
impact of inflation and backlog inflation should not have a significant impact on our income to the extent we are able to raise our hourly billing rates commensurate with our staff compensation rates  which we have done successfully in the past 
if we are unable to raise our hourly billing rates  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because the majority of our contracts may be terminated on relatively short notice  we do not consider backlog to be meaningful

the cautionary statements provided below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra for any such forward looking information 
many of the factors discussed below  as well as other factors  have also been discussed in our prior filings 
factors which could cause our actual financial and other results to differ materially from any results that we might project  forecast  estimate or budget in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the following rapid technological change the systems consulting and implementation market has experienced rapid technological advances and developments in recent years including the development and issuance of new software products and applications 
our failure to stay abreast of such advances and developments could materially adversely affect our business 
we utilize a number of different technologies in developing and providing it solutions for our customers 
the technologies we use are developing rapidly and are characterized by evolving industry standards in a wide variety of areas 
while we evaluate technologies on an ongoing basis and endeavor to utilize those that are most effective in developing it solutions for our customers  there can be no assurance that the technologies we utilize and the expertise we gain in those technologies will continue to be applicable in the future 
there can be no assurance that new technologies will be made available to us or that we can economically apply such technologies 
the inability to apply existing technologies and expertise to subsequent projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
management of change in demand from time to time  our business has experienced significant increases and decreases in the demand for our services and thus our revenues 
in fact  our quarterly revenues have declined for the last six quarters since june  our ability to attract business from new clients and successfully manage such fluctuations in demand are key to our future success 
we continue to evaluate our business needs and the skill sets of our employees in order to balance our resources and costs 
any failure to effectively manage our costs and resources will adversely effect our business 
while we have taken steps to reduce our costs  we may be required to take further actions to reduce our costs if our revenues are insufficient to support our cost structure 
accordingly  an unexpected decline in demand without a corresponding and timely reduction in staffing and other expenses  or a staffing increase that is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in demand  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  any future increase in demand without a corresponding increase in staffing may render us unable to maintain or improve our market share and or strain or overwhelm existing management resources  operational resources  financial resources and management information systems and controls 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future fluctuation in demand successfully 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will grow or achieve the rates of growth we have experienced during certain periods in the past 
page 
table of contents we expect that we may need to further develop our financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures to accommodate future growth or changes in the structure of our business 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop such controls  systems or procedures effectively or on a timely basis  and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
ability to attract and retain employees our business consists mainly of professional services and is inherently labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  particularly project managers and other senior personnel  for our domestic and international operations 
qualified project managers are often in high demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the future 
several attributes of our work environment pose challenges to our ability to attract and retain employees  including i extensive travel requirements  ii our intense work environment and culture  iii our standards for employee technical skills and job performance  and iv our practice of adjusting the number of technical personnel to reflect active project levels 
although we expect to continue to attract sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees and to retain its existing project managers and other senior personnel for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
growth by acquisition we may acquire existing businesses 
the success of any such acquisition will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management and employees to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain customers of acquired firms 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities  consummate acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
in addition  any acquisitions we undertake may involve certain other risks  including potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns 
entry into new lines of business we may enter into new lines of businesses 
our success in any such endeavor will depend upon  among other things  the ability of our management to identify suitable opportunities  successfully implement sound business strategies and avoid the legal and business risks of any new line of business in which we may operate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do any of the foregoing 
in addition  any such undertakings may result in additional costs without an immediate increase in revenues and any such undertaking may divert management s attention from the operation and growth of our core business 
page 
table of contents dependence on key personnel the loss of some or all of our management personnel or project managers could have a material adverse impact on the company  including its ability to secure and complete engagements 
we have employment agreements with our senior management employees that contain non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants 
our employment agreements with our senior management employees generally do not have fixed expiration dates and may be terminated by either the company or the employee 
our employment agreements with lower tier vice presidents generally have a fixed initial term but are automatically renewed for successive one year periods unless terminated by either the company or the employee 
other senior employees also have employment agreements that are generally terminable by the company or the employee upon to days written notice 
cyclicality certain of our customers and potential customers are in industries that experience cyclical variations in profitability  which may in turn affect their willingness or ability to fund systems projects such as those for which we may be engaged 
litigation from time to time  we have been subject to litigation 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of the probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a related liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
however  because of uncertainties relating to litigation  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
in addition to the potential cost and use of cash  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources causing a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
quarterly results may fluctuate our results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of various factors such as general business conditions  timing of project ramp ups and ramp downs  differences in the number of billing days and or holidays between quarters  the number of vacation days and sick days taken by our employees in a particular quarter  and varying weather conditions 
these and other factors can reduce revenues in a given quarter with a corresponding adverse impact on our margins 
client concentration risks we can derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
during the quarter ended december   our top two clients and top five clients accounted for percent and percent of our revenues before reimbursements  respectively 
for  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
in  our top two clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements and our top five clients accounted for percent of our revenues before reimbursements 
although our large clients vary from time to time and our long term revenues do not generally rely on any one client  our revenues and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely impacted if we were to lose one or more of these clients or if we were unable to collect a large accounts receivable 
most of our engagements are terminable on to days notice without penalty to the client 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in the loss of substantial page 
table of contents anticipated revenues and could require us to maintain or terminate a significant number of underutilized employees  resulting in a higher number of unassigned people and or higher severance expenses 
project risks because of the project based nature of our work and the fact that many of the projects we undertake are large  there is a risk of a material adverse impact on operating results because of the unanticipated suspension or cancellation of a large project or a client s refusal or failure to pay fees and expenses when due 
a project cancellation or suspension or a refusal or failure to pay can be based on any number of causes  many of which are beyond our control 
these include  but are not limited to  financial difficulties of a client  personality disputes between client and project personnel  a change in client priorities and a change in client ownership 
the suspension or cancellation of a project or a failure or refusal to pay fees and expenses when due could result in a decrease or adjustment in revenues  the need to reassign staff and damage to our reputation 
because many of our projects are high profile  mission critical projects for major clients  a failure or inability to meet a client s expectations for the amounts budgeted  timing and deliverables for the projects we undertake could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract new business 
third party products and services are integral to the success of many of our projects 
to the extent that third parties do not deliver effective products and services on a timely basis  our project results could be negatively impacted 
although we attempt to limit this risk in our engagement arrangements with clients and maintain errors and omissions insurance  the failure of a project could expose us to significant incremental financial exposure 
competition the systems consulting and implementation market comprises a large number of participants  is subject to rapid changes and is highly competitive 
we compete with and face potential competition from a number of companies that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than do we 
we also compete with smaller service providers whose specific  more narrowly focused service offerings may be more attractive to potential clients than our multi dimensional approach 
our clients primarily consist of fortune and other large corporations and there are an increasing number of professional services firms seeking systems consulting and implementation engagements from that client base 
we believe that our ability to compete depends in part on a number of factors outside our control  including the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate a significant number of senior project managers  the ownership by our competitors of software used by potential clients  the development by others of software that is competitive with our products and services  and the price at which others offer comparable services 
in addition  our clients could develop or acquire in house expertise in services similar to those we provide  which would significantly reduce demand for our services 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our existing client base  maintain or increase the level of revenue generated by our existing clients or be able to attract new clients

table of contents susceptibility to general economic conditions our revenues and results of operations are subject to fluctuations based on the general economic conditions of the united states as well as the foreign countries in which we operate 
the united states is currently experiencing a general economic downturn or recession 
during these periods of general economic downturn or recession  businesses typically reduce or eliminate their spending on discretionary items such as the services that we provide 
therefore  in the event that this economic downturn continues or worsens  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
cost overruns although our engagements are generally billed on a time and materials basis  many of our projects have budget constraints or estimates and some of our projects are contracted on a not to exceed or fixed price basis 
our failure to complete these projects within these parameters exposes us to unrecoverable cost overruns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
intellectual property rights many of our clients have required that we grant to them all proprietary and intellectual property rights with respect to the work product resulting from our performance of services  including the intellectual property rights to any custom software that we have developed for them 
each such grant of proprietary and intellectual property rights limits our ability to reuse work product components and work product solutions with other clients 
in a limited number of such situations  we have obtained  and in the future may attempt to obtain  ownership interest or a license from our clients to permit us to market custom software for the joint benefit of the client and the company 
these arrangements may be nonexclusive or exclusive  and licensors to the company may retain the right to sell products and services that compete with ours 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to negotiate future software licenses upon terms acceptable to us 
we also develop certain foundation and application software tools  methodologies and products that we own and license to our clients 
we regard these software tools  methodologies and products as proprietary and intend to protect our rights  where appropriate  with registered copyrights  patents  registered trademarks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure and transferring title 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or independent third party development of functionally equivalent products 
tsc and technology solutions company are registered service marks of the company 
in addition  our success is dependent upon our specialized expertise and methodologies 
to protect our proprietary information  we rely on a combination of trade secret and common law employee non disclosure policies and third party confidentiality agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that any of these steps will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our specialized expertise and methodologies

table of contents although we believe that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
corporate governance provisions provisions of our charter and by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition 
these provisions include the following our board of directors is staggered into three classes and the members may be removed only for cause upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of the shares entitled to vote  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by the stockholders  to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock 
nasdaq national market listing requirements our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market  which requires that listed stocks maintain a minimum per share closing bid price of the closing bid price of our stock has dropped below on occasions 
if our closing bid price were to drop below per share in the future for an extended period of time  we will face the possibility of delisting under nasdaq rules 
however  there are a variety of actions that we can take to prevent a delisting 
risks of conducting international operations we engage in international operations 
because the cost of doing business abroad is typically higher for united states businesses than the cost of doing business domestically  we could experience a decline in our operating margins if the significance of our international operations increases 
international operations and the provision of services in foreign markets are subject to a number of special risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks  additional security concerns and risks of increases in duties  taxes and governmental royalties  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies 
in addition  any success we experience internationally may depend upon our ability to attract  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees in each of those foreign countries where we conduct operations 
competition for such local personnel qualified to deliver our services is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit  develop and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled  motivated local professional employees to compete successfully in the international market
