item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item the discussion reflects the sale of our canadian subsidiaries  canadian abraxas and old grey wolf  and the completion of our financial restructuring which was completed in january references to continuing operations refer to our operations after taking the sale of canadian abraxas and old grey wolf into account 
the results of operations of canadian abraxas and old grey wolf are included in discontinued operations in our financial statements 
general we have incurred net losses in five of the last six years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas and the volumes of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce 
crude oil and natural gas prices increased substantially in during  crude oil and natural gas prices weakened substantially from the levels 
during  prices began to increase 
in addition  because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced  unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation  exploration and development projects 
in order to provide us with liquidity and capital resources  we have sold certain of our producing properties 
however  our production levels have declined as we have been unable to replace the production represented by the properties we have sold with new production from the producing properties we have invested in with the proceeds of our property sales 
in addition  under the terms of our new senior secured credit agreement and our new notes  we are subject to limitations on capital expenditures 
as a result  we will be limited in our ability to replace existing production with new production and might suffer a decrease in the volume of crude oil and natural gas we produce 
if crude oil and natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production levels continue to decrease  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources current liquidity requirements and future capital resources 
results of operations general 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations o the sales prices of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the level of total sales volumes of crude oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas  o the ability to raise capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  o the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and o the level and success of exploration and development activity 
commodity prices 
our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
in the first quarter of  we experienced a decline in energy commodity prices from the prices that we received in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we had certain crude oil and natural gas hedges in place that prevented us from realizing the full impact of a favorable price environment 
in january  the market price of natural gas was at its highest level in our operating history and the price of crude oil was also at a high level 
however  over the course of and the beginning of the first quarter of  prices again became depressed  primarily due to the economic downturn 
beginning in march  commodity prices began to increase and continued higher through december prices have continued to increase during the first part of as of march   the nymex price for natural gas was per mcf and per bbl for crude oil 
the table below illustrates how natural gas prices fluctuated over the course of and the table below contains the last three day average of nymex traded contracts price and the prices we realized during each quarter for and for continuing operations  including the impact of our hedging activities

hedging activities 
we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
in  and  we experienced hedging losses of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to continuing operations 
in october  all of these hedge agreements expired 
under the expired hedge agreements  we made total payments over the term of these arrangements to various counterparties in the amount of million  of which million was attributable to discontinued operations 
under the terms of our new senior secured credit agreement  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our crude oil and natural gas production for a rolling six month period 
on january   we entered into a collar option agreement with respect to  mmbtu per day  or approximately of our production  at a call price of per mmbtu and a put price of per mmbtu agreement  for the calendar months of february through july in february  we entered into a second hedge agreement for the calendar months of march through february  related to  mmbtu which provides for a floor price of per mmbtu 
selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented 
all data has been restated to reflect continuing operations

revenue and average sales prices are net of hedging activities 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  continuing operations operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in production volumes 
crude oil and natural gas revenue was impacted million from a decline in commodity prices and million from reduced production 
the decline in production was due to the disposition of certain properties in south texas and natural field declines 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in production declines were primarily attributable to our disposition of assets during and natural field declines

lease operating expense 
lease operating expense loe decreased from million in to million in loe on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in the per mcfe cost is due to a decline in production volumes 
the increase in loe from continuing operations is due to additional operations personnel and increased gas lift cost

apb under the interpretation  certain modifications to fixed stock option awards which were made subsequent to december   and not exercised prior to july   require that the awards be subject to variable accounting until they are exercised  forfeited  or expired 
in march  we amended the exercise price to on all options with an existing exercise price greater than 
we charged approximately million to stock based compensation expense in compared to crediting approximately million in this was due to the decline in the market price of our common stock during during  we did not recognize any stock based compensation due to the decline in the price of our common stock 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased by million from million in to million in the decline in dd a is due to reductions in our full cost pool resulting from ceiling test write downs in prior years  as well as lower production volumes 
our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in interest expense 
interest expense increased slightly from million to million for compared to the increase was the result of additional sales pursuant to our production payment arrangement with mirant americas

ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties using the full cost method of accounting 
for more information on the full cost method of accounting  you should read the description under critical accounting policies full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
as of december   the company s net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of its estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the discontinued operations canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering year end prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
the company did not adjust its capitalized costs for its us properties because subsequent to december   crude oil and natural gas prices increased such that capitalized costs for its us properties did not exceed the present value of the estimated proved crude oil and natural gas reserves for its us properties as determined using increased realized prices on march  of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas at june   our net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million million on the us properties and million on the canadian properties 
these amounts were calculated considering june  prices of per bbl for crude oil and per mcf for natural gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for each of the full cost pools 
subsequent to june   commodity prices increased in canada and we utilized these increased prices in calculating the ceiling limitation write down 
the write down for our discontinued canadian operations was million and million relating to continuing operations at june  the total write down was approximately million 
at december  our net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the present value of our estimated reserves  due to increased commodity prices during the fourth quarter and  as such  no further write down was recorded 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional ceiling limitation write downs in the future 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas assets increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers or governmental action cause an abrogation of  or if we voluntarily cancel  long term contracts for our natural gas 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved resources are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from an expense of  for the year ended december  to zero for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the tax benefit relating to the retained canadian properties 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations increased to million in from a loss of million for the year ended the primary reason for the increased loss was an impairment charge of million in related to discontinued canadian operations 
the impairment charge was offset by a deferred tax benefit of million 
discontinued operations also experienced increased interest expense and general and administrative expense in as compared to interest expense relating to discontinued operations increased to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense was due to higher debt levels in related to the old grey wolf credit facility with mirant canada 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  continuing operations operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids sales  applicable to continuing operations increased by million from million in to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commodity prices offset by a decline in production volumes 
increased prices contributed million in additional revenue  which was offset by million due to a decrease in production volumes 
the decline in production was due to the disposition of certain properties and natural field declines 
natural gas liquids volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls in crude oil sales volumes declined from mbbls in to mbbls during natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in production declines were primarily attributable to our property disposition and natural field declines

income taxes 
income tax expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  income taxes for the year ended december  related to deferred taxes on the sale of the wamsutter partnership 
other 
in march  abraxas wamsutter lp partnership sold all of its interest in its crude oil and natural gas properties to a third party 
prior to the sale of these properties  effective january   the company s equity investee share of crude oil and natural gas property cost  results of operations and amortization were not material to consolidated operations or financial position 
as a result of the sale  the company received approximately million  which represented a proportional interest in the partnership s proved properties 
in june  we retired million of the old notes and million of the second lien notes at a discount of million 
discontinued operations our loss from discontinued operations increased slightly in compared to loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was million compared to a loss of million in liquidity and capital resources continuing operations general 
the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs o the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  o acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  and o production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to service our existing debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  funding under the new revolving credit facility and the sale of properties 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
significant downturns in commodity prices  such as that experienced in the last nine months of and the first quarter of  can reduce our cash from operating activities 
although we have hedged a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production and will continue this practice as required pursuant to the new senior secured credit agreement  future crude oil and natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
low crude oil and natural gas prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us 
if the volume of crude oil and natural gas we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
in addition  due to sales of properties in and january  we now have significantly reduced reserves and production levels 
in the future we may sell additional properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
while we have had some success in pursuing these activities  historically  we have not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
working capital 
at december  our current liabilities of approximately million exceeded our current assets of million 
however  as a result of the financial restructuring completed in january our current liabilities were reduced by million to million as of january   which includes trade payables of million and million of revenues due third parties 
after giving effect to the scheduled principal reductions required during we will have cash interest expense of approximately million 
this cash interest relates to the new senior secured credit agreement 
we do not expect to make cash interest payments with respect to the outstanding new notes  and the issuance of additional new notes in lieu of cash interest payments thereon will not affect our working capital balance 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for continuing operations for the three years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category development    facilities and other total    during  and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
for  our capital expenditures are subject to limitations imposed under the new senior secured credit agreement and new notes  including a maximum annual capital expenditure budget of million for  and subject to reduction in the event of a reduction in our net assets 
we currently expect to have a capital expenditure budget of up to million for the first quarter of our capital expenditures could include expenditures for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but we currently have no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset crude oil and natural gas production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties 
sources of capital 
the net funds for continuing operations provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    net cash provided by used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities    total    operating activities for the year ended december   from continuing operations provided us million of cash 
investing activities related to continuing operations used million during our investing activities included the sale of properties which provided million  and the use of million primarily for the development of producing properties 
financing activities used million during  relating primarily to the repurchase of a production payment 
operating activities for the year ended december   from continuing operations  provided us million of cash 
investing activities used million during primarily for the development of producing properties 
financing activities provided million during future capital resources 
we will have four principal sources of liquidity going forward i cash on hand  ii cash from operating activities  iii funding under the revolving credit facility  and iv sales of producing properties 
however  covenants under the indenture for the outstanding new notes and the new senior secured credit agreement restrict our use of cash on hand  cash from operating activities and any proceeds from asset sales 
we may attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  though the terms of the new note indenture and the new senior secured credit agreement substantially restrict our ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o incur liens  o pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  o consummate certain asset sales  o enter into certain transactions with affiliates  o merge or consolidate with any other person  or o sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
our best opportunity for additional sources of liquidity and capital will be through the issuance of equity securities or through the disposition of assets 
contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements o long term debt o operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in contractual obligations dollars in thousands total long term debt     operating leases includes balances of old grey wolf facility which is reported within liabilities related to assets held for sale in the december  balance sheet 
after the transactions described in item recent events  the amounts would be in each of the three years  and   in and  for these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the term loan facility  the revolving credit facility and the new notes 
these repayments assume that interest will be capitalized under the term loan facility and that periodic interest on the new senior secured credit agreement will be paid on a monthly basis and that we will not draw down additional funds thereunder 
office lease obligations 
leases for office space for abraxas and new grey wolf expire in april and april  respectively 
other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploitation  development  exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion 
long term indebtedness 
the recently completed financial restructuring resulted in the retirement of our first lien notes  second lien notes and old notes  together with the old grey wolf credit facility 
as of march   our long term indebtedness consists of the senior credit facility and the notes issued in connection with the financial restructuring 
the following table sets forth our long term indebtedness as of december   and proforma information reflecting the consummation of the restructuring transactions

during  the company acquired of the common stock of an unrelated corporation 
the use of net operating loss carryforwards of the acquired corporation of  acquired in the acquisition are limited to approximately  per year 
as a result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock for acquisitions and sales of common stock  an additional ownership change under section occurred in october accordingly  it is expected that the use of all us net operating loss carryforwards generated through october including those subject to the and ownership changes discussed above of  will be limited as described above and in the following paragraph 
an ownership change under section occurred in december  following the issuance of additional shares  as described in note it is expected that the annual use of us net operating loss carryforwards subject to this section limitation will be limited to approximately  subject to the lower limitations described above 
future changes in ownership may further limit the use of the company s carryforwards 
in assets with built in gains were sold  increasing the section limitation for by approximately the annual section limitation may be increased during any year  within years of a change in ownership  in which built in gains that existed on the date of the change in ownership are recognized 
in addition to the section limitations  uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  the company has established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively  related to continuing operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
abraxas has chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of crude oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization date on our crude oil and natural gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
the company has experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in with respect to its continuing operations 
our crude oil and natural gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of crude oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of crude oil and natural gas properties increases when crude oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher crude oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a write down of million  related to our continuing proved reserves 
the write down in was due to low commodity prices 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
should commodity prices decline  a further write down of the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties may be required 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  o and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
hedge accounting 
from time to time  we use commodity price hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
results of those hedging transactions are reflected in crude oil and natural gas sales 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for the company on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
under this statement  all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow or fair value hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales or interest expense  as applicable  over the respective contract terms 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated because energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of  as of december  we did not have any outstanding derivatives 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period 
the amortization provisions apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the company has applied these standards to its purchase of the minority interest of old grey wolf 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
is effective for us january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
we have completed our assessment of sfas no 
and based on our estimates  we do not expect the statement to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for future periods 
at january   we estimate that the present value of our future asset retirement obligation aro for natural gas and oil property and related equipment is approximately  we estimate that the cumulative effect to the adoption of sfas no 
and the change in the accounting principle will be a loss of  which will be recorded in the first quarter of the impact on each of the prior years was not material 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires a single accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be sold and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
a component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the entity 
a component of an entity that is classified as held for sale  or has been disposed of  is presented as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component 
the company adopted sfas  consequently  the operating results of the canadian business segment operations  which were held for sale at december  and sold after year end are included in discontinued operations 

in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb no 
  and  amendments of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas no 
clarifies guidance related to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications 
sfas no 
also amends other existing pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions relating to the reporting of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt become effective for us beginning january  with earlier adoption encouraged 
all other provisions of this standard have been effective for the us as of may  and did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires costs associated with exit of disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company will continue to use apb no 
to account for stock based compensation while providing the disclosures required by sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent crude oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december  from continuing operations  a decline in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices would have reduced our operating revenue  cash flow and net income by approximately million for the year 
hedging sensitivity on january   we adopted sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
currently  we use only cash flow hedges and the remaining discussion will relate exclusively to this type of derivative instrument 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholder s equity  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to a cash flow hedge that becomes ineffective  remain unchanged until the related production is delivered 
if we determine that it is probable that a hedged transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings immediately 
gains and losses on hedging instruments related to accumulated other comprehensive income and adjustments to carrying amounts on hedged production are included in natural gas or crude oil production revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
in  and  we experienced hedging losses of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million respectively were applicable to continuing operations 
in october  all of these hedge agreements expired 
under the expired hedge agreements  we made total payments to various counterparties in the amount of million 
under the terms of the new senior secured credit agreement  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our crude oil and natural gas production for a rolling six month period 
as of january   we have entered into a collar option agreement with respect to  mmbtu per day  or approximately of our production  at a call price of per mmbtu and a put price of per mmbtu 
in february of we entered into an additional hedge agreement for  mmbtu per day with a floor of per mmbtu 
as of march   the fair market value of our hedge positions is not material 
for abraxas  the fair value of the hedging instrument was determined based on the base price of the hedged item and nymex forward price quotes 
the following table sets forth our hedging position as of march  time period notional quantities price fair value february  july   mmbtu of production collar with floor of per day and ceiling of march  february   mmbtu of production floor of  per day all hedge transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
interest rate risk at december   substantially all of abraxas long term debt was at fixed interest rates from to and not subject to fluctuations in market rates and old grey wolf s long term debt was at a fixed interest rate of as a result of the financial restructuring that occurred in january  we will have approximately million in outstanding indebtedness under the new senior secured credit agreement  accruing interest at a rate of prime plus  subject to a minimum interest rate of 
in the event that the prime rate currently rises above the interest rate applicable to our outstanding indebtedness under the new senior secured credit agreement will rise accordingly 
for every percentage point that the prime rate rises above  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis 
our new notes accrue interest at fixed rates and is accordingly not subject to fluctuations in market rates 
foreign currency our canadian operations are measured in the local currency of canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets 
canadian operations reported a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the canadian dollar would have changed our net loss by approximately  we do not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future
