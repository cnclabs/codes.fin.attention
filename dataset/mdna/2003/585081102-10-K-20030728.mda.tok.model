with the vasotrac monitor  medwave is emerging as a technological alternative to invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring in many surgical procedures 
in addition  the vasotrac monitor is being used in situations where a conventional blood pressure cuff is simply not effective 
this can occur for a number of reasons  which make the vasotrac product an excellent alternative to a conventional blood pressure cuff 
pediatric patients  morbidly obese and frail patients are all becoming very good candidates for the vasotrac within hospital settings 
we believe that in time  sensor based blood pressure monitoring  due to its clinical flexibility  as well as improved accuracy  comfort and speed  will promote the change of the market away from the use of invasive catheters within specific patient groups  and completely eliminate the automatic blood pressure cuff found throughout many hospital settings 
with the ability to interface our vasotrac monitor into larger more comprehensive patient monitoring systems via the use of our nia v line  the addition of the high motion tolerant hmt software in areas where a high degree of motion exist  and the capability of monitoring patient groups from pediatric to the morbidly obese  the company believes that the vasotrac monitor is the most advanced non invasive blood pressure measurement instrument available in the market today 
the vasotrax handheld monitor is an alternative product for mercury based sphygmomanometers  which are pervasive in the market today in all aspects of the healthcare spectrum 
there is a desire to replace the mercury sphygmomanometers  as there are concerns about the environmental impact of a potential mercury spill  and the effects that such a spill may have on the well being of the healthcare providers 
healthcare professionals have expressed a general resistance to changing from mercury  due to good reliability  and the general in expensive nature of these devices 
we believe that products like the vasotrax  which are small and lightweight  operate on batteries  offer more comfort  faster time to readings  digital storage capabilities  and are sensor based will change the market away from manual blood pressure cuffs  such as the mercury sphygmomanometers 
in addition  the technology in the vasotrax handheld monitor may be attractive in a home based setting in the future 
this is a market  which currently has more than million people who are monitoring their own blood pressure values  as they have been diagnosed with blood pressure irregularities 
there is a great deal of user error  which may occur with the self application of a blood pressure cuff in a home setting 
we believe that the technology in the vasotrax allows us to adapt the current vasotrax handheld monitor into a home based  self applicable device in the future 
the company has also invested in developing the mj oem module over the past few years 
the purpose of this product is to incorporate blood pressure measurement into other company s devices  which may offer other physiologic monitoring parameters  therapeutic treatments  or other general monitoring functions in a variety of clinical environments 
we believe that over time  as we continue to achieve success in having major institutions purchase the vasotrac technology  that other companies will feel compelled to convert at least a portion of their blood pressure measurement products to the same functionality as is offered in the vasotrac 
there is an estimated  physiologic monitoring systems installed in hospital settings in the united states  which currently offer an automatic blood pressure cuff for measuring patients blood pressure 
the company has intentionally designed its business plans and activities over the past few years  around a tiered approach to the market 
tier one is to enter and become a well known alternative to both invasive catheters and automatic blood pressure cuffs in the hospital settings 
in an effort to gauge the success of this strategy  the company has attempted to penetrate larger more prestigious medical centers 
these are typically involved in educating the clinicians of the future  and perform clinical research to validate the usefulness of new technologies 
the success of this strategy will allow the company to branch out into the smaller markets  and smaller hospitals  as they will have the endorsement and support of the larger academic medical centers 
another benefit from this initial strategy is that the company has the ability to provide exposure to a medical staff  which may move around from center to center 
therefore  positive exposure in one center may lead to activity in other centers in the future 
tier two of the business approach is to focus on the markets  which are defined as outside the hospital 
this is the pre and post hospital market 
the company believes that the emergency medical market segments may prove to be a popular segment for the company s technology 
several problems exist for caregivers in the emergency environment  such as the inability to monitor with a blood pressure cuff at times of motion  or when a patient s heart rhythm is disturbed 
field reports from users of the company s technology have been very favorable in these situations 
during the past few years  the company invested in developing an advanced motion tolerance algorithm  specifically for this environment 
in addition  the company has had good success with the vasotrax handheld monitor in this market segment  even though the sales channel has been focused on the hospital environment 
the other area which may prove beneficial is the physician office market 
patients are living longer  and are becoming better educated about their own health care and treatment 
as the use of the company s technology becomes more pervasive  the more consumers will be exposed to the technology and its associated benefits 
the third tier of our business approach will be to use the success from tiers one and two to enter the consumer market 
the company believes that there are numerous benefits that a home based patient will experience with our technology  such as speed to readings  accuracy and consistency  comfort and data transmission 
in  the company received the prestigious seal of acceptance from the alliance of children s hospitals 
this award is presented only to those products that are considered more efficacious than others for the treatment of children 
the alliance of children s hospitals is an alliance of of the largest  most prestigious children s hospitals in the us and canada 
in addition  the company was honored with frost and sullivan s technology innovation award 
this award is presented each year to the company that has demonstrated excellence in technology innovation in the market 
the award recognizes the ability of the company to successfully develop and introduce a new technology  formulate a well designed product family  and make significant product performance contributions to the industry 
the company believes that these prestigious accomplishments  along with the increasing number of clinical studies that are being completed within a multitude of clinical settings  endorse the fact that the company s technology is cutting a new path to standardization using non invasive sensors while monitoring blood pressure
