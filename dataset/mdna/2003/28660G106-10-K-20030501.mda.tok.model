we sell our products to over  separate locations worldwide  including in the united states in department stores and mass retailers  as well as internationally in prestige department stores  perfumeries  boutiques and travel retail locations 
we have established ourselves as a source of over fragrance brands through brand ownership  brand licensing and distribution arrangements 
in addition to the approximately prestige fragrance brands we own and license  we also distribute more than prestige fragrance brands to many retailers primarily in the united states 
our portfolio of owned and licensed fragrance brands includes elizabeth arden s red door  th avenue  elizabeth arden green tea  sunflowers and ardenbeauty  elizabeth taylor s white diamonds  passion and forever elizabeth  logo

our skin care brands include elizabeth arden s ceramides  eight hour cream and first defense 
our cosmetics products include lipstick  foundation and other color cosmetics products under the elizabeth arden brand name 
on january   we acquired the elizabeth arden business  including certain trademarks and patents for the elizabeth arden brands of prestige fragrance  cosmetic and skin care lines  the license for the elizabeth taylor fragrance brands and the white shoulders fragrance brand and related assets and liabilities 
following the acquisition  we changed our name from french fragrances  inc to elizabeth arden  inc

as a result of our adoption of emerging issues task force no 
on february   we have classified gift with purchase activities  which were previously reported as selling  general and administrative expenses  as cost of sales and have classified amounts paid to retailers for co op advertising and beauty consultant expenses  which were previously reported within selling  general and administrative expenses  as a reduction of net sales 
this reclassification has been done for all fiscal years presented

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the securities and exchange commission has recently issued financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggesting companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions 
we have accounted for our acquisitions  including the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we often obtain appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses  trademarks and intangibles  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we periodically review intangible assets  at least annually or more often as circumstances dictate  for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 those intangible assets that will continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
additionally  intangible assets  including goodwill  must be evaluated for impairment 
our intangible assets generally consist of exclusive brand licenses and trademarks 
we do not carry any goodwill 
we evaluated which of our intangible assets were considered to have indefinite lives and determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks  acquired on january   have indefinite useful lives 
thus  we ceased amortizing these trademarks on february  additionally  pursuant to sfas no 
 we completed our transitional impairment testing of these assets 
that effort and assessments of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm indicated that no impairment adjustment was required 
see recently adopted accounting standards 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns represents management s estimate of future returns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
logo 
table of contents allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for certain promotional product 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and markdowns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  additional provisions for inventory obsolescence may be necessary 
stock based compensation 
at january   we had three stock option plans  which are more fully described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee and director option grants  as such grants had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to earnings in the period of such determination 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased approximately to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  the sales increase was driven by the growth of our business with our mass retail customers  due in large part to our open sell program and the addition of certain distributor brands both of which have increased the volume of products sold  new product launches  including the fragrances ardenbeauty and forever elizabeth  and a rebound in travel retail sales 
the open sell program allows retailers to display fragrances on open counters and shelves rather than in locked cases  giving consumers easier access to our products 
these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in us department stores and fewer us prestige department store doors from previously announced closings 
in fiscal  we generated million  or approximately  of our net sales in the united states and million  or approximately of our net sales internationally 
the war in iraq  uncertain geopolitical events and diseases affecting customer purchasing patterns such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars may negatively impact net sales in the current fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased approximately to million for fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
gross margin increased to of net sales from logo 
table of contents in the corresponding prior year 
the increase in gross profit was principally due to higher sales  a reduction in the effect of the high cost elizabeth arden inventory purchased prior to the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  a million inventory write down recorded in fiscal and reduced cost structure in distribution operations  partially offset by continued weakness in us department stores and a greater proportion of sales of distributed brands  which have lower gross margins than owned and licensed brands 
for the fiscal year ended january   our gross profit was reduced by approximately million and gross margin was reduced by percentage points  due to the effect of high cost inventory purchased prior to the elizabeth arden acquisition 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or approximately million  to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase versus the prior year was due principally to additional advertising to support new product launches and higher incentive compensation costs 
these increases were partially offset by reduced expenses from management initiatives  including the restructuring of certain international operations  and reduction in selling overhead expenses  as well as benefits from favorable foreign currency rates 
favorable foreign currency rates contributed approximately million to the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to for the fiscal year ended january   as compared with in the prior year 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects the leveraging of our cost structure and favorable foreign currency rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased approximately million to million for the fiscal year ended january   compared to million for the corresponding prior fiscal year  principally as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
in adopting sfas no 
 we concluded that the elizabeth arden trademarks are considered indefinite lived assets and after january  are no longer being amortized 
amortization relating to these trademarks amounted to million for the fiscal year ended january  see recently adopted accounting standards 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased by approximately million to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the prior year 
the decrease resulted primarily from reduced borrowings under our bank credit facility and lower interest rates paid on that debt 
see notes and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was approximately million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared with a benefit from income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended january   reflecting higher operating earnings 
the effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of income loss before income taxes for fiscal was versus in the prior year 
the increase over the prior year primarily reflects adjustments for foreign and state tax liabilities 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income loss 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  increased approximately million to million  as compared with a net loss of million in the prior year 
the increase was a result of higher net sales and associated gross profit and lower depreciation and amortization  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate 
accretion and dividend on preferred stock 
the accretion and dividend on preferred stock  which is a non cash charge to net income attributable to common shareholders  was million for the fiscal year ended january  and a non cash charge to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million for the fiscal year ended january  these amounts represent accretion on the fair value of  and the imputed dividends on  the series d convertible preferred stock logo

ebitda 
ebitda net income plus less the provision for benefit from income taxes  plus interest expense  plus depreciation and amortization increased approximately million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared with million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in ebitda was the result of higher net sales and gross profit  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
for a reconciliation of net income to ebitda  see note under item selected financial data 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january net sales 
net sales increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal  we generated million  or approximately  of our net sales in the us and million  or approximately  of our net sales internationally 
the increase in net sales was primarily a result of increased sales from the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  partially offset by weakness in the retail environment 
the increase in sales included an increase in the number of products sold by us  particularly elizabeth arden skin care and cosmetics products  as well as an increase in our customer base  primarily internationally and with us prestige department stores 
the weak retail environment  exacerbated by the events of september   had a particularly negative effect on sales to us prestige department stores  international travel retail outlets  and certain international distributors 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in fiscal  as compared with million for fiscal  and gross margins expanded from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business 
following the acquisition  the mix of our sales changed  with significantly increased sales of higher margin owned and licensed brands relative to lower margin distributed brands 
included in the gross margin for fiscal were sales of elizabeth arden products purchased prior to the acquisition  which were carried at a higher cost and resulted in a lower gross margin than sales of elizabeth arden products manufactured after the acquisition 
once these lower margin products were sold  gross margins increased 
for the year ended january   the effect on gross profit of selling arden product purchased prior to the acquisition was a reduction of gross profit of approximately million 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash inventory provision of million to write down certain distributed brands and non core product offerings that we do not intend to continue to carry due to retailer planogram updates and to expedite the sales of excess inventory  particularly gift sets and other promotional merchandise 
excluding the effect of the high cost products purchased prior to the acquisition and the inventory provision  gross profit would have totaled million for a gross margin of 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  as compared with million in the prior year  reflecting additional selling and administrative costs associated with the elizabeth arden business acquired 
as a result of the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  there was an increase in sales of owned and licensed brands  which require higher costs to support  including higher demonstration  advertising and product development expenses 
we also added approximately  employees to our company in connection with the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  significantly increasing our international employee base  our us department store sales force and our administrative personnel 
logo 
table of contents the number of offices and facilities also increased as a result of the acquisition 
in fiscal  we commenced a restructuring of our operations in the united states  eliminating approximately positions  representing of our us headcount 
in conjunction with this restructuring  we recorded a  charge included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition to this charge  we also incurred million of restructuring costs  primarily severance costs resulting from a realignment of our workforce and prestige department store door closures  which was recorded as an adjustment to the allocation of the purchase price in the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business 
of this million of restructuring costs  most of the cash was paid out between february and april for a discussion of the elizabeth arden acquisition  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of depreciation and amortization associated with the assets acquired as part of the arden acquisition 
approximately million of the increase in depreciation and amortization was associated with the assets acquired 
interest expense 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased approximately to million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal  as a result of increased debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business and associated working capital requirements 
the increased debt included million of senior secured notes due  as well as borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
benefit from provision for income taxes 
we recorded a net benefit from income taxes of million for fiscal  as compared with a net provision of million for fiscal the effective tax rate calculated as a percentage of income before income taxes declined from of income in fiscal to of net loss in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was associated with the increase in our international operations  as we operated in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
our international affiliates and subsidiaries had varying levels of profitability and tax rates 
in addition  we recorded an increase in the income tax valuation allowance associated with certain foreign losses and deferred tax assets 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net loss income 
for fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million  as compared with net income of million in fiscal the increase in net loss was due to increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization  which more than offset the increase in sales and gross profit and the benefit from income taxes 
accretion and dividend on preferred stock 
as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business  we issued to an affiliate of unilever  shares of series d convertible preferred stock 
the series d convertible preferred stock was recorded at its fair market value of million  with an allocation of million made for the beneficial conversion feature and reclassified to additional paid in capital 
the difference between the liquidation value of million and the balance recorded in the convertible  redeemable preferred stock account on our consolidated balance sheet is being accreted over the life of the series d convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock carries a annual dividend yield  which is payable beginning in march the accretion on preferred stock of million for fiscal is a non cash charge to net loss attributable to common shareholders 
net loss income attributable to common shareholders 
net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled million in fiscal  as compared with net income of million in fiscal the net loss attributable to common shareholders included net loss  plus the accretion and dividends associated with the series d convertible preferred stock

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were made during the second half of the fiscal year 
due to the size and timing of certain orders from our customers  sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between quarters of the same and different years 
as a result  we expect to experience variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  with peak inventory and receivable balances in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal and are normally highest in the months of september  october and november 
during the fourth fiscal quarter ending january of each year  significant cash is normally generated as customer payments on holiday season orders are received 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million versus million for the corresponding prior year 
cash flow from improved operating performance was partially offset by increases in working capital required to support the higher levels of sales 
for the fiscal year ended january   accounts receivable were above prior year levels primarily due to higher sales  the timing of those sales versus the prior year and a greater proportion of international receivables  which generally have longer terms than domestic receivables 
for the fiscal year ended january   inventories were slightly higher versus the prior year  as the incremental investment in additional distributed brands in the fourth quarter more than offset the reduction in high cost arden inventory 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the fiscal year ended january   compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase resulted from the acquisition in the fourth quarter of the wings trademarks compared with proceeds in the prior year from the sale of certain trademarks and intangibles 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was million versus million in the prior fiscal year 
cash and cash equivalents increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities  compared to million for the prior year 
of that amount  million was generated from operating cash flows  offset by a net working capital use of  the net working capital use reflected increases in accounts receivable  prepaid and other assets  somewhat offset by a decline in inventories  and increases in accounts payable  other payables and accrued expenses 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from increased sales due to the acquisition of the elizabeth arden business coupled with the fact that no trade receivables were acquired with the elizabeth arden business in january we used million of net cash in investing activities  as million for capital expenditures was partially offset by million received for the sale of certain trademarks and intangibles 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million  with payments on short term and long term debt being partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchase warrants 
cash and cash equivalents declined million to million from million during fiscal logo 
table of contents debt and contractual financial obligations and commitments 
at january   our long term debt and financial obligations and commitments by due date were as follows amounts in thousands contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current portion capital leases operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the decrease in long term debt  from million at january  to million at january   reflects a scheduled debt repayment of million of our subordinated debentures in may and million of senior notes that we repurchased in the open market 
the repurchases of the senior notes occurred in january and were settled in february at january   the payable amount pending settlement was included in other payables and accrued expenses on the balance sheet 
for more information on our long term debt and contractual commitments  see notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for debt service  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and additional brand acquisitions or product distribution arrangements 
we have historically financed  and we expect to continue to finance  our needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
as a result of our improved operating performance  in december  we executed an amendment and restatement to our revolving bank credit facility 
the amended facility substantially improves our financial flexibility 
the key terms of the amendment include an increase in the size of the facility from million to million  a lowering of the interest rate spread over the libor or prime rate charged to loans  a broader borrowing base formula with more favorable advance rates  removal of the inventory cap from the borrowing base and elimination of all the financial maintenance covenants  except for a fixed charge coverage ratio of that applies only if availability under the facility declines to less than million 
the facility matures in january our borrowings under this facility are limited to a borrowing base  calculated based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
the borrowings are collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
the credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
in addition  the indentures pursuant to which our senior notes are issued restrict the payment of dividends subject to our ability to meet certain financial covenants 
prior to the december amendment  our borrowings under the credit facility were subject to terms of the facility that were amended in march the march amendment resulted from weaker than expected performance in fiscal the amendment included the bank group s waiver of non compliance with covenants regarding certain financial ratios for the fourth quarter of fiscal  in particular the debt to ebitda ratio and the ebitda to net interest expense ratio  and an amendment of the related covenant levels for each quarter of fiscal the march amendment also modified selected additional sections of the credit facility 
we have been in compliance with the terms of the credit facility since the march amendment 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that the credit facility  as currently amended and restated  provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  however  we may not remain in compliance with the covenants and would not be allowed to borrow under the revolving credit facility 
in logo 
table of contents addition  a default under our revolving credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default on our senior notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
as of january   we had million of borrowings and approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or new product distribution arrangements 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers of prestige fragrance brands and with distributors that hold exclusive distribution rights regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive manufacturing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with manufacturers and distributors 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations 
during the fiscal year ended january   we invested approximately million in net capital expenditures  primarily related to in store counters and testing units  tools  dies and molds and computer hardware and software 
we expect to incur approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal  including for the expansion of our roanoke  virginia distribution facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of january   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
the average of our month end borrowings during fiscal was million 
borrowings under our credit facility are seasonal  with peak borrowings in the third quarter of our fiscal year 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to variable rates and  accordingly  our earnings and cash flow will be affected by changes in interest rates 
based upon our fiscal average borrowings under our credit facility  and assuming there had been a two percentage point change in the average interest rate for these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense for the year ended january  would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
to date  we have not engaged in derivative transactions to mitigate interest rate risk  as most of our debt is in the form of senior notes and bears a fixed rate 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions that would mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effect  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk we sell our products in approximately countries around the world
