these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other footnotes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
those accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact comprehensive income  are considered critical accounting policies 
bancgroup recognizes the following as critical accounting policies accounting for acquisitions  accounting for allowance for loan losses  and accounting for income taxes 
accounting for acquisitions 
bancgroup s growth in business  profitability and market share over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions 
bancgroup s acquisition strategy has historically utilized the pooling of interest and purchase business combination methods of accounting 
effective july   bancgroup adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which allows only the use of the purchase combination method of accounting 
for acquisitions under the purchase method  bancgroup is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal or other valuation techniques 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals for planned facilities dispositions and employee benefit related considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests 
these tests  based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles  also contain estimates such as discount rate and time periods in their calculations 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as well as the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
accounting for allowance for loan losses 
management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy and allocation of the allowance considers both impaired and unimpaired loans and takes into consideration the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  the reviews of regulators  and an analysis of current economic conditions 
while management believes that it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions which have resulted in an allowance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that in the future  adverse economic conditions  increased nonperforming loans  regulatory concerns  or other factors will not require further increases in  or re allocation of the allowance 
further discussion regarding bancgroup s accounting for allowance for loan losses is included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes 
bancgroup uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
determination of the deferred and current provision requires analysis by management of certain transactions and the related tax laws and regulations 
management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
those judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
financial accounting standards board releases see note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
strategy through acquisitions and internal growth colonial has grown from a bank with million in assets in to become one of the top banks in asset size in the nation with billion in assets and branch sales offices operating in six states 
management expects to continue expanding by adding branches in existing markets and through selective acquisitions 
foundation 
colonial s foundation is built upon a community banking philosophy that encourages and supports local responsibility for customer relationships and creates an atmosphere that nurtures and personalizes those relationships 
we refer to this strategy as financial strength in local hands 
this operating philosophy has been important in developing a strong customer base  particularly with respect to lending relationships  retaining skilled and highly motivated local management teams  involving local boards of directors and in making acquisitions 
colonial s community banking philosophy requires a fundamental understanding of the marketplace it serves and the very best in customer service 
colonial constructed its foundation upon a strong lending strategy 
attention to creating personal relationships with quality borrowers  while maintaining sound and conservative underwriting standards  is the backbone of our philosophy  and has allowed colonial to effectively manage its asset quality throughout its history 
local expertise with established customer relationships combined with independent oversight of credit decisions and conservative underwriting standards is a proven approach to the maintenance of high asset quality 
the company has established regional bank loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise  while colonial provides independent oversight through senior management participation in the state loan committees and senior credit administration review of large credits prior to approval in addition to its regular review of other credits 
this process  which includes regional directors and management  allows colonial to stay on top of local market trends 
maintaining high asset quality will always be a primary focus 
colonial s asset quality is demonstrated by its charge off history and nonperforming asset levels  which for the past ten years have been among the lowest for southeastern regional banks 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate were at december  net charge offs were of average loans in and in  which compares favorably to the southern regional banks as defined by sandler o neill and partners  which were in and in  respectively 
colonial emphasizes loan  deposit and noninterest income growth in each market area of the regional banks 
because markets and communities differ widely  as well as individual circumstances  customers require different answers and solutions to their financial needs 
we believe customers appreciate the knowledge of their needs and the local environment that our bank officers can provide 
colonial s structure of local customer relationship responsibility supported by centralized operations gives our local banks decision making capability and an operational structure to service the customer in a cost effective and efficient manner 
using this strategy to meet the needs of retail and commercial banking customers in each market has proven successful as evidenced by our growth in loans  deposits and noninterest income 
growth 
colonial remains committed to a strategy of building a solid franchise in growth markets 
colonial s growth market expansion has been concentrated in florida  georgia  texas and nevada 
according to the census bureau  these areas represent four of the five fastest growing states in the country as measured by population growth from july to july as of december   colonial has a well established presence in these areas as reflected in the following table

myers mortgage warehouse lending orlando total florida georgia atlanta  macon  columbus texas dallas  austin nevada las vegas  reno colonial continues its expansion by selectively filling in these high growth markets through strategic placement of new branch locations and branch or bank acquisitions that increase our ability to provide customer service in the market 
in addition to six new branch openings in  colonial also completed the acquisition of a community bank headquartered in dallas  texas with five branches in march  and a community bank headquartered in palm beach  florida with eight branches in september management plans to continue assessing acquisition opportunities when presented 
due to the success of our growth strategies  colonial s geographic mix of loans and deposits has significantly changed over the past six years 
the following tables illustrate the loan and deposit contribution of each state and reflect the significant impact of the high growth markets 
to total at december  loans by state florida alabama georgia texas nevada to total at december  regional bank deposits by state florida alabama georgia texas nevada internal loan growth from georgia  florida  texas and nevada  was for and for  while core deposits from these areas grew in and in the keys to colonial s retail banking initiatives are sales  service and relationships 
colonial s retail banking strategy is based on a top down sales management approach that establishes specific goals to enhance profit and growth by deepening customer relationships 
we have successfully converted all branches into sales offices by redefining branch personnel roles and responsibilities to align our organization for more efficient sales management 
we continue our proactive sales and service culture by enhancing score selling customer on relationships effectively  our ongoing retail banking sales and relationship building training program 
management continues to enhance a branch incentive plan to focus on noninterest income and core deposit growth 
we believe that all of these efforts have contributed to the continual improvement of cross sell ratios resulting in growth in loans  deposits and noninterest income 
in we exceeded our cross sell ratio goal  selling more products to existing customers 
we are raising that goal in with expectations to continue our momentum 
management expects our established franchise  especially in the higher growth markets  to provide plenty of untapped opportunities for growth through the sale of additional products and services to existing customers 
products and services 
colonial s goal is to be every customer s number one provider of financial services from traditional deposit products  investment products  consumer  commercial  mortgage loans  to financial planning  insurance  cash management  electronic banking  credit card and merchant services 
colonial bank expects to realize growth opportunities in its markets by acquiring new customers and through deepening customer relationships with existing customers 
colonial s asset liability and product and services management teams provide regional bank management with the resources to remain competitive in their market areas by identifying and implementing products and services with attractive pricing 
because of the location of our markets and the types of customers we serve  we expect financial planning products and services to play a major role in our future growth 
income from financial planning services increased from to  while maintaining a gross margin 
through colonial s investment services  we offer discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
colonial has made efforts to facilitate our competitive stance in the brokerage  trust  insurance and asset management markets 
colonial brokerage  inc  a member of the nasd  was established in this allowed colonial to offer additional brokerage products to better serve our customers 
along with our trust department  we have partnered with highly respected trust companies to provide additional trust services to our customers 
in  we also partnered with a leading insurance annuity provider to offer our own proprietary annuity 
together with these efforts  and to ensure that our product offerings remain competitive  the company s financial planning group plans to advance to another level in through the development and coordination of its products and sales programs 
colonial plans to ensure that all products and services are among the most competitive in our markets 
as we expand our offerings throughout the six states that currently form our principal market areas  it is our objective that our customers  regardless of where they live  recognize the colonial brand as a symbol of trustworthiness and service mindedness 
it is our goal that the power of our brand plainly invites and encourages customers to choose us for their banking and investment needs 
support 
by centralizing many operational functions such as loan and deposit operations and customer and branch support  the local banking officers have been allowed to concentrate on the customer and service his or her needs 
centralized operations provide an advantage in servicing the customer base across our enterprise by providing continuity and efficiency 
tools 
colonial continues to enhance the tools available to our employees to further our sales culture  improve customer service and enhance operational efficiencies 
colonial s new retail delivery solution is expected to be fully implemented by the end of colonial began the eagle project in the objective of eagle is to upgrade the company s automated retail delivery solution so that we may better produce sales  provide exceptional service and promote profitable customer relationships while gaining operational efficiencies 
eagle epitomizes our philosophy that banking is a people business 
we recognize that while investing in technology is important  it matters most how you deploy that technology to better enable our people to serve our customers 
we implemented phase one during  including a new internet banking product and enhanced call center delivery system 
during we expect to implement new branch service and loan delivery systems 
some anticipated advantages of the new retail delivery solution are robust sales features with automatic product suggestions and sales prompts  automated referrals  automated workflow of many manual processes and improved sales incentive plan and compliance reporting 
eagle combines advances in technology with the reengineering of processes to eliminate nonvalue added procedures while improving customer service through enhanced product and service delivery 
a future investment in technology is an anticipated imaging project with conversion planned for imaging  which is internet enabled  is expected to provide process improvement opportunities and cost containment while improving customer service 
value 
we believe that continued implementation of our strategy offers the best opportunity to increase shareholder value 
we are established in fast growing  economically vibrant markets 
we expect to deepen our market coverage internally by benefiting from the population growth in these markets  by distinguishing ourselves from our competition through excellent customer service and by providing new products 
since these are growing markets  we believe we have the ability to establish a strong customer base by continuing our successful community banking strategy 
this strategy consists of providing strong lending expertise in the local markets  accompanied by competitive deposit and loan products and other financial services such as financial planning services  cash management and electronic banking 
by focusing on sales and customer service  these locally developed and maintained customer relationships should continue to grow 
colonial cannot guarantee its success in implementing the initiatives or reaching the goals outlined in this discussion 
the following analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides details with respect to this summary material and identifies trends concerning the initiatives taken in and prior to business combinations bancgroup continued its expansion into high growth areas by selectively filling in existing markets with two acquisitions in in march  bancgroup acquired mercantile bancorp  inc mercantile and its wholly owned subsidiary bank  first mercantile bank  na mercantile bank

review of results of operations overview bancgroup s primary line of business is commercial banking through its wholly owned subsidiary colonial bank

the acquisitions of mercantile bancorp  inc and palm beach national holding company in the details of these acquisitions are included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company exited the mortgage servicing business 
the financial results for this line of business have been separately reported as discontinued operations 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds interest expense 
three year comparisons of net interest income in dollars and yields on a tax equivalent basis are reflected on the average volume and rates table 
the schedule presented is on a consolidated basis that includes the now discontinued mortgage operations in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the principal factors affecting the company s yields and net interest income are changes in the levels of interest rates and changes in the level and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
details of the impact of these factors are discussed on the following pages 
level of interest rates over the course of  rates and yields on the balance sheet adjusted to the rapid and significant rate declines that occurred in and additional declines in short term rates were stable throughout until the federal reserve lowered the targeted fed funds rate to a year low of on november  however longer term market rates  particularly year mortgage rates  dropped dramatically over the course of the year from above in march to record low rates staying below throughout the last four months of the year 
the declines in mortgage rates fueled growth in mortgage warehouse lending and mortgage loan production  but also increased prepayments in the existing portfolio of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the november drop in short term rates as well as the drop in prime rate resulted in repricing of the floating rate loan portfolio 
short term borrowings fell immediately with the november rate cut of basis points 
however  rates on interest bearing deposits and savings accounts were not lowered a full basis points due to its already low rate levels 
time deposits should continue to reprice lower resulting in additional declines in rates over the next few quarters 
earning assets one of the most significant factors in the company s increase in income has been the  and increases in average interest earning assets in   and  respectively 
as a result of the changes in rates and economic uncertainty in the market  the mix in earning assets changed from to  with a large part of the growth coming from the securities portfolio 
the remaining increase came from growth in the mortgage warehouse lending division as well as other loan growth 
earning assets as a percentage of total average assets was  and in  and  respectively 
loans 
loans grew  million or from december  to december  and resulted in an increase in average loans of for following a increase in this increase includes million related to the two acquisitions completed in additionally  there was a shift in the composition of the loan portfolio 
while the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio increased million to of the total loan portfolio at december  from at december   residential real estate loans decreased million to of the total loan portfolio compared to for the same periods 
residential real estate loans are predominantly adjustable rate first mortgages that have a low level of credit risk and accordingly have lower yields than other types of loans 
demand for this type of loan has declined as more borrowers are looking for fixed rate loans  which the company originates but sells in the secondary market 
mortgage warehouse lending is a self contained lending division that funds mortgage loans held for sale in the secondary market by various independent mortgage companies 
the record low mortgage rates available in resulted in large increases in loans for this division 
the large increase million resulted in a increase in the average loan balance for this growth was a primary driver for the increases in net interest income in  yet the average rates on this portfolio of in to in negatively impact the net interest margin 
the average rate on the total loan portfolio was for  compared to for and for  a decline of basis points from to and basis points from to this drop was due to the full adjustment of the portfolio to the rapid and large rate declines of and the previously discussed changes in the mix of the portfolio 
mortgage loans held for sale 
mortgage loans held for sale represent single family residential mortgage loans originated or acquired as short term participations in pools of mortgage loans 
it is the company s policy to enter into forward sales commitments at the same time these mortgage loans are originated or acquired 
the level and direction of long term interest rates have a dramatic impact on the volume of mortgage loan originations from new construction and refinances 
as a result of decreasing mortgage interest rates  average mortgage loans held for sale increased to million in from million in and million in securities 
the average securities portfolio increased to  million in from  million in and  million in this increase was the result of an effort to maintain earnings growth during a period of slow loan growth 
selectively purchasing year average life securities has enabled bancgroup to take advantage of attractive interest rate spreads to short term funding costs 
the average yield declined to in from and in and  respectively 
this decline was due in part to low mortgage rates that accelerated prepayments in the mortgage backed investment portfolio and increased the premium amortization recognition for these investments 
additionally  million in new volumes and the accelerated repayments were invested in lower yielding securities adding downward pressure on the securities yield in noninterest earning assets average noninterest earning assets increased million from to this increase in average was primarily due to premises  equipment  goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the decrease in average of million from to was primarily a result of the discontinuance of the mortgage servicing operation in interest bearing liabilities the average cost of funds decreased basis points to in  compared to in and in the lower average cost of funds in and was primarily the result of continued repricing of deposits and other borrowings as a result of the previously discussed drop in rates and a change in mix of interest bearing liabilities from cds certificates of deposit to short term borrowings and lower cost deposits 
bancgroup funds loan growth primarily with customer deposits 
interest bearing deposits 
average retail non time interest bearing deposits grew in  excluding acquisitions and in this growth was primarily the result of efforts to emphasize relationship deposit growth and the impact of lower rates on other deposit products 
as there was decreased emphasis in on higher cost time deposits  average retail time deposits decreased compared to  a decrease excluding acquisitions 
the average rate on interest bearing deposits excluding time deposits dropped to for compared to for and for the rate on time deposits declined to an average of in compared to for and in given that posted cd rates as of year end for to month terms ranged from to  this portfolio should have additional rate declines 
borrowings 
competitive pressures on new time deposits and variable interest deposits remained strong 
due to these pressures  the desire to reduce high cost time deposits and the need to fund strong earning asset growth  the company s funding mix shifted during the past two years to a higher concentration of borrowings 
the percentage of average total borrowings to total assets was for  for  and for these borrowings are an excellent funding source  since they are at rates lower than or comparable to what the market rates are for new time deposit funds 
in addition to borrowing sources  the company continues sales strategies to increase retail deposits 
as discussed under liquidity  bancgroup s management considers these sources of funds to be adequate to fund future loan growth 
noninterest bearing deposits average noninterest bearing deposits increased by million from to the noninterest bearing retail deposits grew in  excluding acquisitions 
as a result of this growth and the company s continuing effort to increase low cost or no cost deposits  noninterest bearing deposit mix improved from to of total retail deposits 
net interest margin as a result of the impact of rates  volumes and mix on the balance sheet  the net interest margin increased slightly from in to in the yield on earning assets fell to in compared to and in and  respectively 
the decline in yield on earning assets was more than offset by a decline in the cost of funds to in compared to and in and  respectively 
the margin ended the year lower than the average for at for the fourth quarter 
lower mortgage rates have resulted in continued prepayments of mortgage backed loans and securities  thus lowering the yield on both of these portfolios 
these trends are expected to continue into additionally the november rate cut negatively impacted the margin in the fourth quarter and should continue to impact the margin in as compared to bancgroup s asset sensitive position is further described in the section interest rate sensitivity

noninterest income one of bancgroup s primary strategies has been to expand its noninterest income 
the company continues to emphasize growth in financial planning services  mortgage origination income  electronic banking services and cash management services 
these services provide a broad base of revenue generation capabilities 
noninterest income excluding securities gains increased million or from to and million or from to noninterest income including securities gains increased in and in years ended december  increase decrease compared to compared to in thousands noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts financial planning services electronic banking mortgage origination securities gains  net other income total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts increased million or in and increased million or in the increase in is primarily due to an increase in account analysis fees and the acquisitions completed in the increase in is primarily the result of increased service fee rates and the acquisitions completed in service charges on deposit accounts include income from the sale of cash management products 
these products include lock box services  sweep accounts  zero balance accounts  electronic data interchange  automated clearing house  and webbiz  an online tool for bank account reporting services 
cash management revenues increased and in and  respectively 
colonial continues to actively promote these products through a dedicated sales force 
colonial expects continued growth in cash management services by expanding these services to existing customers 
financial planning services include discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
sales of these products are directly affected by changes in the economy and the stock market as well as the perception of investors of the future impact of these changes 
as a probable result of investor uncertainty with regard to the economy  the company experienced a decline in sales of investments to customers in however  this decline was more than offset by an increase in fixed rate annuity sales 
income from financial planning services was million in as compared to million in and million in  a and increase in and  respectively 
electronic banking services provide our customers banking when and where they want it 
electronic banking includes atm network  business and personal check card services and our internet banking product 
in  colonial increased the number of customers it serviced with atm  check card and business check card products 
it also introduced a new internet banking product which more than doubled internet banking customers 
as a result  electronic banking fees increased in when compared to and in when compared to mortgage origination is available in all of colonial s regional banks 
a central mortgage processing unit that facilitates the production and sale of mortgage products supports each region 
colonial offers both adjustable and fixed rate products 
adjustable rate products are generally retained in colonial s loan portfolio while fixed rate products are sold in the secondary market 
income from loans originated and subsequently sold in the secondary market are reflected in noninterest income 
mortgage origination volume and product mix are directly affected by changes in mortgage interest rates 
mortgage origination income from secondary market loans increased to million in and to million in due to the decrease in mortgage rates 
this decrease in rates created increased demand for fixed rate products due to an increase in home purchases and refinancing activity 
noninterest expense noninterest expense to average assets was   and in   and  respectively from continuing operations excluding merger related expenses 
in support of the company s sales culture  bancgroup continues to make strategic investments in its product and service offerings  technology systems  sales incentives and branch network to enhance the company s competitive presence 
the company added and new or acquired branches in and  respectively 
in addition to these branches  the company also made investments in improved automation of branch delivery systems  enhanced internet banking and wire transfer systems and network infrastructure improvements 
accordingly  noninterest expense increased in both and excluding merger related expenses  intangible amortization and operating expenses of acquired banks  noninterest expense would have increased in as compared to and in compared to years ended december  compared to increase decrease compared to in thousands noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense  net furniture and equipment expenses amortization of intangible assets merger related expenses fdic and state assessments advertising and public relations stationery  printing and supplies telephone legal fees postage and courier insurance professional services travel other total noninterest expense noninterest expense  from continuing operations excluding merger related expenses to average assets salaries and benefits increased by million in and million in these salary increases in and are due to additional employees from bank acquisitions  branch openings  normal salary increases and increases in production related compensation linked to increases in income from ancillary services as previously discussed

the increase in legal expenses in and was primarily related to the increase in nonperforming assets as well as other normal business issues  and in additional work related to new or proposed banking and securities laws and regulations 
the increases in all other expense categories were due to normal expenses resulting from the company s growth 
merger related expenses in  bancgroup completed the acquisition of mercantile bancorp  inc in dallas  texas with branches and palm beach national holding company in palm beach  florida with branches 
the results for include pretax costs associated with these mergers and acquisitions totaling  these costs are composed of travel  training  marketing  retention bonuses and incremental charges related to the integration of acquired banks  such as system conversions and customer supplies

the acquisitions of mercantile bancorp  inc and palm beach national holding company in the details of these acquisitions are included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
these items  as well as a more detailed analysis of bancgroup s financial condition  are discussed in the following sections 
loans growth in loans and maintenance of high asset quality are the key components for improved earnings 
management s emphasis  within all of bancgroup s banking regions  is on loan growth in accordance with local market demands and in reliance upon the lending experience and expertise in the regional banks and our specialized lending divisions such as mortgage warehouse 
management believes that its strategy of meeting local demands and utilizing local lending expertise has proved successful 
this success is evident in internal loan growth of in  in  in and in  excluding acquisitions 
internal loan growth continues to be a major factor in bancgroup s increasing earnings 
this local customer relationship responsibility combined with independent oversight of credit decisions and conservative underwriting standards are key to the maintenance of the company s high asset quality 
bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans representing and of total loans  respectively 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans are spread geographically throughout alabama  florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  dallas  reno and las vegas with no more than of total commercial real estate and construction loans in any one of our geographic regions 
the alabama economy experiences a generally slow but steady rate of growth  while georgia  florida  nevada and texas are experiencing higher rates of growth 
real estate in bancgroup s lending areas has not experienced significantly inflated values due to excessive speculation or inflationary pressures 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate and construction portfolios consists of various property types such as multi family housing  lodging  office buildings  warehouses  shopping centers  amusement recreational facilities  one to four family residential housing developments  and health service facilities 
the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines further reduce risk 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans continue to perform at acceptable levels 
net charge offs to average loans for the commercial real estate portfolio were and for and  respectively 
net charge offs to average loans for the construction portfolio were and for and  respectively 
substantially all construction and commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees of the principals involved 
owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio represented of the total commercial real estate portfolio at december  residential real estate loans represent of total loans in compared to in substantially all of these loans are adjustable rate first mortgages on single family  owner occupied properties  and therefore  have generally less credit risk and lower interest rate sensitivity 
demand for this type of loan has declined as more borrowers are looking for fixed rate loans  which the company originates  but sells in the secondary market 
bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
net charge offs to average loans for the residential real estate portfolio was for compared to for loans classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural  representing of total loans  consist of secured and unsecured credit lines and equipment loans for various industrial  agricultural  commercial  financial  retail  or service businesses 
the risk associated with loans in the category are generally related to earnings capacity of  and the cash flows generated from  the individual business activities of the borrowers 
consumer loans  representing of total loans  are loans to individuals for various purposes 
automobile loans and unsecured loans make up the majority of these loans 
the principle source of repayment is the earning capacity of the individual borrower  as well as the value of the collateral for secured loans 
outstanding loans in our international division  located in our south florida region  represent of our total outstanding loans at december  this exposure is spread among approximately banking institutions in five latin american caribbean countries 
these transactions are trade related involving letters of credit as well as participations in commercial paper back up lines 
the company s exposure in argentina was million of which was current and on repayment terms at december  although performing according to terms  these credits are included in nonperforming assets as nonaccrual loans 
bancgroup established a mortgage warehouse lending division in this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans to mortgage origination companies  predominantly in the southeast 
loans outstanding at december  and were billion and billion  respectively  with unfunded commitments of million and million at december  and  respectively 
bancgroup does not have a syndicated lending department  however  the company has credits with commitments funded and unfunded of million that fall within the bank regulatory definition of a shared national credit generally defined as a total loan commitment in excess of million that is shared by three or more lenders 
the largest outstanding amount to any single borrower is million which is a commercial real estate credit  with the smallest credit being approximately  at december   million of these commitments were funded 
substantially all of the increase in these loans was attributed to the growth within our mortgage warehouse lending division 
although by definition these commitments are considered shared national credits  bancgroup s loan officers have established long term relationships with each of these borrowers 
these commitments are comprised of the following commercial real estate projects located within existing markets international credits which are primarily unfunded short term commitments to correspondent banks mortgage warehouse lines to eight large institutions the mortgage warehouse lending department conducts its own audits of these borrowers operating facilities to two large national corporations headquartered in the florida and alabama markets management believes that these are sound participations involving credits that fit within colonial s lending philosophy and meet its conservative underwriting guidelines 
as discussed more fully in subsequent sections  management has established policies and procedures designed to ensure maintenance of adequate liquidity and liquidity sources 
bancgroup has arranged funding sources in addition to customer deposits that provide the company the capability to exceed a loan to deposit ratio and maintain adequate liquidity 
gross loans by category december  in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential installment and consumer mortgage warehouse lending other total loans less unearned income net loans management believes that its existing distribution of loans  whether grouped geographically  by industry  or by borrower  does not expose bancgroup to unacceptable levels of risk 
the current distribution of loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
this diversification  in addition to our emphasis on quality underwriting  serve to reduce the risk of losses

the goals of bancgroup with respect to loan maturities and rate sensitivity continue to focus on shorter term maturities and floating or adjustable rate loans 
at december   approximately of loans were floating rate loans 
contractual maturities may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan pay offs 
the uncertainties of future events  particularly with respect to interest rates  make it difficult to predict the actual maturities

bancgroup s strategy in this regard is carried out through its policies and procedures for the underwriting and ongoing review of loans and through a company wide senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continual basis 
in addition  the company has established regional bank loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight by participating in the state loan committees 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the credit worthiness of the borrower  but generally require maximum loan to value ratios of for commercial real estate and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
collateral values referenced above are monitored and estimated by loan officers through inspections  independent appraisals  reference to broad measures of market values  and current experience with similar properties or collateral 
loans with loan to value ratios in excess of have potentially higher risks which are offset by other factors including the borrowers or guarantors credit worthiness  the borrowers other banking relationships  the bank s lending experience with the borrower  and any other potential sources of repayment 
based on the credit review process and loan grading system  bancgroup determines its allowance for loan losses and the amount of provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable losses on loans present in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  the provision for loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance  and the allowance for loan losses of acquired banks 
in determining the provision for loan losses  it is necessary for management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of historical loss experience and current economic conditions 
see note  allowance for loan loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the overall goal and result of these policies and procedures is to provide a sound basis for new credit extensions and an early recognition of problem assets to allow increased flexibility in their timely disposition 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made on an individual loan basis for all identified potential problem loans with a percentage allocation for the remaining portfolio 
the allocation of the remaining allowance represents an approximation of the reserves for each category of loans based on management s evaluation of the respective historical charge off experience and risk within each loan type 
specifically with regard to mortgage warehouse lending  there is less risk of loss because the underlying collateral securing the mortgage warehouse lines of credit are pre committed to approved investors and are normally on the lines less than days 
the volume of these loans fluctuates with changes in mortgage rates  which can result in volatile changes to the volume of loans and the ratio of ending allowance to ending loans 
the ratio of ending allowance as a percent of loans for all other loans was and at december  and  respectively 
loan loss experience the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was   and in   and  respectively 
as a result of the company s localized lending strategies and early identification of potential problem loans  bancgroup s net charge offs have been consistently low 
the following schedule reflects greater than coverage of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated by the allowance for loan losses 
management has not targeted any specific coverage ratio in excess of  and the coverage ratio may fluctuate significantly as larger loans are placed into or removed from nonperforming status 
management s focus has been on establishing reserves related to an early identification of potential problem loans

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is also to charge off consumer installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower total nonperforming loans other real estate and in substance foreclosure repossessions total nonperforming assets aggregate loans contractually past due days for which interest is being accrued total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming loans and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of net loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more  which are still accruing interest fluctuations from year to year in the balances of nonperforming assets are attributable to several factors including changing economic conditions in various markets  nonperforming assets obtained in various acquisitions and the disproportionate impact of larger over million individual credits 
total nonperforming loans increased approximately million in as compared to this increase was primarily due to the addition of the company s credits in argentina of million and one domestic credit in the amount of million to non accrual status during the third and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the domestic credit is secured by prime real estate and the company s loan to value position is low at approximately  therefore  no loss on this credit is anticipated 
excluding this domestic credit  the total non performing asset ratio would have declined to in  as compared to in  and the allowance for loan loss as a percent of non performing loans would have increased to 
the argentine credits are current and on repayment terms  however  the federal reserve has required that all argentine credits be placed on nonaccrual status 
management  through its loan officers  internal credit review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of loans  which have been placed on a classified loan list 
the status of all material loans is reviewed at least monthly by loan officers  and quarterly by bancgroup s centralized credit administration function and annually by regulatory agencies 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment inadequate  the amount of reserve held is increased or the loan is reduced to estimated recoverable amounts 
as of december   substantially all of these loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
the above nonperforming loans represent all material credits for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans was not significant for the years ended december      and a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively  and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
as previously discussed  the increase in impaired loans from to was primarily the result of the company s credits in argentina of million and one domestic credit of million being placed on non accrual status during the third and fourth quarter of  respectively 
the domestic loan is secured by prime real estate with a loan to value ratio of approximately  therefore  no loss on this credit is anticipated 
securities on a daily basis  bancgroup determines the funds available for short term investment while funds available for long term investment are projected based upon anticipated loan and deposit growth  liquidity needs  pledging requirements and maturities of securities  as well as other factors 
an investment strategy is developed based on these factors  along with management s interest rate forecast and the balance sheet position 
all securities are either classified as held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities are those securities which management has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
the carrying value of held to maturity investments was million at the end of compared to million at year end the aforementioned decline was due to maturities and calls in the portfolio 
securities classified as held to maturity consisted primarily of us treasury bonds  agency mortgage backed securities and state  county and municipal obligations 
overall  the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years 
securities available for sale represent those securities that the company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk or other similar factors 
these securities are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or losses  net of any tax effect  added or deducted from shareholders equity 
at december   available for sale securities totaled billion or of the total portfolio versus billion or at the end of the increase of million in resulted from the investment of excess liquidity during a period of slowing loan growth 
securities available for sale at year end consisted of us treasury and federal agency notes  variable and fixed rate agency mortgage backed securities  state  county and municipal securities  corporate debt  private issuer mortgage backed and trust preferred securities  and equities  primarily federal reserve and fhlb stock 
overall  the stated maturity of these securities was years with an average life of years years excluding equities 
stated maturities differ from average lives because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
bancgroup s policy requires all securities purchased for the securities portfolio  except state  county and local municipal obligations  to be rated investment grade or better 
securities backed by the us government and its agencies  both on a direct and indirect basis  represented approximately of the portfolio at december  state  county and local municipal securities represented approximately of the portfolio with rated investment grade or better by one of the major rating agencies 
the purchase of non rated municipal securities is limited by policy to those bonds in the general market served by bancgroup which provide opportunities for additional banking business

the principal goal is to provide the company s customer base with convenient access to branch locations while enhancing the company s potential for future increases in profitability 
the growth of deposits and strengthening of customer relationships continues to be a primary strategic initiative of bancgroup 
bancgroup is continuing to grow deposits throughout its market areas 
sales and relationship development programs will continue to capitalize on the higher growth opportunities in florida  georgia  texas and nevada 
core deposits excluding brokered and time deposits grew in  while cd s less than  remained flat 
as a result  the mix of non time deposits improved to from at the end of the prior year 
bancgroup s retail deposit base is currently in florida  in alabama  in georgia  in texas and in nevada 
as market demographics change  products and services are restructured to meet the needs of a particular region or customer base 
strong regional management supported by bancgroup s marketing and treasury teams provide the company with resources to remain competitive in its deposit markets 
brokered deposits are a source of out of market wholesale deposits with the potential for significant increase 
in market retail deposit growth has sufficiently funded earning asset growth without significant reliance on brokered deposits 
at december  the company s brokered deposits amounted to million in cd s and million in money market deposits compared to million and million  respectively at december  interest rate sensitivity bancgroup has an asset liability management committee almco  the objective of which is to optimize the net interest margin while assuming reasonable business risks 
almco annually establishes operating constraints for critical elements of bancgroup s business  including interest rate sensitivity 
the goal of almco is to minimize the volatility in the net interest margin caused by changes in interest rates  by taking an active role in managing the level  mix  repricing characteristics and maturities of assets and liabilities and by analyzing and taking action to manage mismatch and basis risk 
bancgroup presented a fairly neutral interest rate risk profile at the end of over the course of  as long term rates declined  the balance sheet became more asset sensitive 
ie  exhibiting risk to declining rates but benefit from rising rates 
this shift was due to significant growth in floating rate loans primarily mortgage warehouse lending and a reduction in the duration of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities due to accelerated prepayments as mortgage rates declined 
almco s focus in was to minimize the increase in asset sensitivity by extending the duration of assets through the purchase of securities and by funding earning asset growth with short term borrowings 
additionally million of fixed rate liabilities were swapped to a floating rate in almco monitors the projected impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income using several tools  including static rate sensitivity reports  or gap reports  and income simulations modeling under multiple rate scenarios 
the following table represents the output from the company s simulation model based on the starting balance sheet at december   when the fed funds rate was 
the table measures the impact on net interest income of an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in basis point increments for the calendar months following the date of the change 
this twelve month projection of net interest income under these scenarios is compared to both the twelve month net interest income projection with rates unchanged and fourth quarter net interest income annualized 
this table reflects bancgroup s asset sensitive position as earnings are expected to improve if rates increase but would be negatively impacted if rates decline 
percentage change in month projected net interest income basis points change fed funds rate versus projected net interest income under no rate change versus th qtr 
net interest income annualized no rate change the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  estimates of rates on loans and deposits given these rate changes  the ability to maintain interest rate floors on loans as market rates decline  deposit decay rates and loan investment prepayments  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table represents the output of the simulation model for the net portfolio value npv  which is defined as the net present value of interest rate sensitive assets  interest rate sensitive liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the table represents the percentage change in the npv under basis point rate shocks versus the npv assuming rates at december  and basis points change fed funds rates change in net portfolio value vs 
npv under no rate change december  december  no rate change the following table summarizes bancgroup s maturity rate sensitivity or gap at december  at december  interest rate sensitive within total balance days days days years over years in thousands rate sensitive assets federal funds sold and other short term investments investment securities securities available for sale mortgage loans held for sale loans  net of unearned income allowances for possible loan losses net loans non earning assets total assets rate sensitive liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits certificates of deposit less than  certificates of deposit more than  ira s open time deposits short term borrowing long term debt noncosting liabilities equity total liabilities equity period gap cumulative gap the last two lines of the preceding table represent the interest rate sensitivity gap which is the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap schedule reflects a positive gap at months  therefore as of december   bancgroup  as is demonstrated in the income simulation results  has a greater exposure to net income if interest rates decrease and would benefit from rising rates 
in reviewing the table  it should be noted that the balances are shown for a specific point in time and  because the interest sensitivity position is dynamic  it can change significantly over time 
in the table all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  variable rate assets and liabilities are reflected in the time interval of the assets or liabilities earliest repricing date 
fixed rate assets and liabilities have been allocated to various time intervals based on contractual repayment and prepayment assumptions 
furthermore  the balances reflect contractual repricing of time deposits and management s position on repricing for demand deposit and savings accounts 
while these accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  experience and analysis have shown them to be relatively rate insensitive 
if of these accounts were included in the day category  the year cumulative gap would be a positive million 
additionally  the table does not reflect the impact of floors on floating rate loans 
liquidity another prominent focus of almco is maintaining adequate liquidity 
liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
retail deposit growth is a primary focus of bancgroup s funding and liquidity strategy 
core retail deposits excluding broker and time deposits grew at a rate of in to provide million of funding 
with branches in four of the top five population growth states  management expects that retail deposits should continue to be a major component to funding growth 
bancgroup has worked to expand the availability of short and long term wholesale funding sources in addition to the emphasis on core deposit growth 
availability from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is an important part of bancgroup s wholesale funding sources 
as of december   the lendable collateral value pledged at fhlb amounted to billion up from billion the prior year 
recent changes in fhlb collateral and credit policies and continued loan growth are likely to increase the lendable collateral value and the fhlb will continue to provide an important source of wholesale liquidity 
other wholesale funding sources include fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements and brokered cd s 
management believes its liquidity sources and funding strategies are adequate given the nature of its asset base and current loan demand 
bancgroup at december  utilized of the total wholesale funding sources estimated to be available to them 
by mid january the utilization ratio was down to 
borrowings bancgroup utilizes a variety of funding sources to assist in meeting its needs of funding loan growth  securities acquisitions and deposit fluctuations 
fed funds lines  repurchase agreements and issuances of commercial paper are sources for short term borrowings 
credit facilities with the fhlb are used for both short and long term borrowings 
additionally  bancgroup has a million revolving credit facility with an unrelated financial institution that had a zero balance at year end 
from time to time bancgroup has issued subordinated debentures  subordinated notes and trust preferred securities to provide both capital and funding 
over the course of  bancgroup focused on short term borrowings for interest sensitivity purposes 
fed funds were de emphasized and repurchase agreements and short term borrowings from fhlb were increased 
fhlb credit facility availability increased in as previously pledged commercial real estate loans grew and additional securities  heloc home equity line of credit and second mortgage loans were pledged 
fhlb borrowings increased by million to billion as of december  compared to the previous year end 
by mid january  fhlb borrowings declined by million 
bancgroup issued million in trust preferred securities on march  the securities carry a rate of and mature april  bancgroup has an option to call the securities at par on or after april  the securities qualify for tier capital treatment

capital adequacy and resources management is committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to protect shareholders and depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
management s strategy to achieve these goals is to retain sufficient earnings while providing a reasonable return to shareholders in the form of dividends and return on equity 
the company s dividend payout ratio target range is 
dividend rates are determined by the board of directors in consideration of several factors including current and projected capital ratios  liquidity and income levels and other bank dividend yields and payment ratios 
the amount of a cash dividend  if any  rests with the discretion of the board of directors of bancgroup as well as upon applicable statutory constraints such as the delaware law requirement that dividends may be paid only out of capital surplus and net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and the preceding fiscal year 
bancgroup also has access to equity capital markets through both public and private issuances 
management considers these sources and related return in addition to internally generated capital in evaluating future expansion or acquisition opportunities 
the federal reserve board has issued guidelines identifying minimum tier i leverage ratios relative to total assets and minimum capital ratios relative to risk adjusted assets
