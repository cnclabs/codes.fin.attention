item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenue  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenue cost of revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets amortization of goodwill restructuring charges impairment of goodwill acquired in process research and development total cost and operating expenses loss from operations interest income interest expense other income loss on investments  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss since our inception  we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology  build our worldwide network  sell and market our services and software and support our operations 
we have also incurred significant amortization expense and impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets from the acquisition of businesses 
in recent years  we have incurred significant restructuring expenses related to employee severance payments and vacated facilities under long term leases 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses over at least the next to months 
as of december   we had million of convertible notes outstanding  which become due in we ended the year with cash and marketable securities of million  of which million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash 
we believe that our success is dependent on increasing our net monthly recurring revenue  developing new services and software that leverage our proprietary technology and achieving and maintaining a proper alignment between our revenue and our cost structure 
we consider net additions to monthly recurring revenue to be a critical success factor for our business 
we define net monthly recurring revenue as new bookings of recurring revenue less lost recurring revenue due to customer cancellations  non renewals or collections issues 
a typical recurring revenue contract has a term of one to two years 
as of december   our net monthly recurring revenue under contract was greater than such amount at december  we continue to sell our services and software into a depressed information technology market 
we are also experiencing competitive pricing pressures on our service offerings 
due to these and other factors  our ability to predict our future revenue results is limited  and there is no guarantee that net monthly recurring revenue under contract will continue to increase 

table of contents our ability to maintain gross margins that fall within our target range is also critical to our success 
accordingly  we are continuously managing our network costs by entering into competitively priced bandwidth and colocation contracts that are aligned with our revenue forecasts and our estimates as to the amount of traffic we expect to carry over our network 
as a result  we have been successful in maintaining our gross margins despite pricing pressure on our service offerings 
we have taken steps to align our recurring operating expenses with our revenue and gross margins 
our recurring operating expenses include research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
these expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we undertook actions to reduce our overall cost structure  including employee severances  while maintaining a high level of employee productivity and customer service 
as a result  we expect the downward trend in these operating expenses to continue 
our operating expenses also include restructuring charges 
we incurred restructuring charges of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses relate to actual and estimated termination and modification costs on leases for excess facilities and employee severance costs 
we may incur restructuring charges in the future depending on several factors  including the timing and amount of any lease modifications and terminations  the timing and amount of any sublease receipts  and any future employee severances 
we expect that  if successful  our efforts to terminate and modify our excess facility leases will require a significant amount of cash in the future 
recent events in october  we reduced our workforce by  or approximately employees  across all functional areas 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of of million for one time benefit payments to affected employees 
as a result of these actions  we expect operating costs to decline in from previous levels 
in november  robert cobuzzi became our chief financial officer following the resignation of our former chief financial officer  timothy weller 
in november  we settled a stock price appreciation guarantee to cnn news group  or cnn  by making a million cash payment to cnn and allowing cnn to draw on a million letter of credit previously issued by us 
we acquired the obligation as part of our acquision of intervu  inc in april the settlement was accounted for as an adjustment to the fair value of the common stock for the amount of additional cash issued 
consequently  the total purchase price was not adjusted 
in december  we sold our joint venture interest in akamai technologies japan kk to softbank broadmedia corporation  or sbbm 
prior to the sale  sbbm had owned a interest in akamai technologies japan kk 
we expect that sbbm will operate the entity as a non exclusive reseller of our services in japan 
as a result of the sale  we recorded a gain of  in loss on investments  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in january  we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary in japan through which we sell our services and support our reseller arrangements 
the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the new subsidiary will be consolidated into our future quarterly and annual financial statements 
in january  we paid million  including interest  to a former employee of an acquired company as a result of an april judgment against the acquired company for breach of contract 
we have included this amount in accrued expenses as of december  in february  we settled an employment related lawsuit with multiple claims brought by a former employee for a cash payment of million 
our insurance carrier reimbursed us for million of such settlement expense 
as of december   to reflect this settlement  we have included million in accrued expenses and million in current assets  and we recorded the net amount of million in general and administrative expenses 

table of contents change in presentation of consolidated statement of operations expense categories in  we modified the presentation of our consolidated statements of operations 
all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
these modifications had no impact on loss from operations or net loss 
we modified certain expense categories as follows we included in cost of revenue the salaries  benefits and other direct costs of employees who operate our network 
these costs were previously included under the engineering and development category 
we disaggregated our sales  general and administrative category into two categories sales and marketing and general and administrative 
we moved internal information technology and network operation costs from engineering and development to general and administrative and cost of revenue  respectively 
our engineering and development organization became known as our research and development organization 
in addition  we simplified the presentation of the consolidated statement of operations as follows we included equity related compensation in cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative based on the functional role of the related employee 
we included the depreciation and amortization on our network equipment and internal use software used to deliver our services in cost of revenue 
we included the depreciation and amortization of all other property and equipment in general and administrative 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  depreciable lives of property and equipment  restructuring accruals and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and the specific manner that we apply those principals  that require us to make critical accounting estimates about matters that are uncertain and have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we define a critical accounting estimate as an estimate that requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and either the estimate is derived from a range of potential outcomes or changes in the estimate would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our services when an enforceable arrangement to deliver the service has been established  the service or license has been delivered to and accepted when applicable by the customer  the fee for the service or license is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
at the inception of a customer contract  we make a critical estimate as to whether collection is reasonably assured 
we base our estimate on the successful completion of a credit check  financial review or the receipt of a deposit from the customer 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  assuming the other criteria are met 
if we subsequently determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we cease recognizing revenue until cash is received 
we also record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all other unpaid invoices for the related customer 
changes in our estimates of whether collection is reasonably assured would change the amount of revenue or bad debt expense that we recognize 
concurrent transactions from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology with an enterprise at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same enterprise 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless the fair value to us of the vendor s product or service can be established objectively and realization of such value is assumed probable 
investments we periodically review all investments for reduction in fair value that is other than temporary 
we consider several factors that may trigger an other than temporary decline in value  such as the length of time the investment s value has been below cost and the financial results of the entity in which we invest 
when we conclude that the reduction is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is adjusted to its fair value through a charge to loss on investments on the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in our judgment as to whether a reduction in the value of an investment is other than temporary would increase loss on investments 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such a triggering event occurs  we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations 
we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the critical accounting estimates required for this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets 
changes in these estimates could increase loss from operations materially 
restructuring liabilities related to facility leases when we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease  we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred 
table of contents under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us 
in the latter case  we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease  the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken  and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan 
beginning in  in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard  we will record a restructuring liability  discounted at the appropriate rate  for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 
when we record a restructuring liability  we make critical estimates related to the amount of rent or termination costs that we will pay and the amount of sublease income that we will receive related to the vacant property 
as of december   we had million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities 
our estimates are based  in part  on the most recent negotiations with the landlords of these properties and current market conditions 
we expect that approximately million of the amount accrued as of december  will be paid within twelve months 
should the actual amounts or the timing of restructuring payments differ from our estimate  we would adjust the restructuring liability through a charge or benefit to restructuring charges on the consolidated statement of operations 
if we are not able to successfully modify these leases  the total contractual payout for these properties would be approximately million over the next seven years 
if we are not successful in subleasing these facilities  the total incremental restructuring charge would be approximately million 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation and the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation allowance for deferred taxes we provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a change in our estimate of the future realization of deferred tax assets would result in a material income tax benefit 
capitalization of internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the application development stage of internal use software projects 
if the project is an enhancement to previously developed software  we must assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred during the application development stage for capitalization 
we must gather employee data for the amount of time incurred during the application development phase 
once the project is complete  we must estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we must periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded in during the period 
results of operations revenue 
total revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue was million for the year ended december  for and  no single customer accounted for more than of revenue

service revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was million for the year ended december  the decrease in service revenue in as compared to was attributable to a decrease in customers under recurring revenue contracts  partially offset by an increase in average monthly recurring revenue per customer 
the increase in service revenue in compared to was due to an increase in customers under recurring revenue contracts 
although we have achieved positive net monthly recurring revenue during  we are not able to reasonably predict future service revenue given the uncertainty of competition  customer cancellations and the current macroeconomic environment 
license and other revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  license and other revenue was million for the year ended december  license and other revenue includes sales of customized technology solutions sold as perpetual licenses or delivered under long term contracts 
the decrease in license and other revenue in as compared to was attributable to a reduction in the amount of software and other technology licensed to customers 
in contrast  we increased our license and other revenue in as compared to  principally as a result of the introduction of our edgescape license offering in service and license revenue from related parties decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service and license revenue from related parties was million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue from related parties between and was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue from sockeye networks  inc  or sockeye  as a result of a reduction in of sockeye s minimum monthly revenue commitment and the cancellation in november of sockeye s contract with us 
the increase in revenue from related parties between and was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sockeye compared to the prior year 
as a result of sockeye s cancellation of its service agreement and the sale of our equity interest in akamai technologies japan kk  we do not expect significant revenues from related parties in the future 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and monthly fees for housing our servers in third party network data centers 
cost of revenue also includes network operation employee costs  cost of licenses  depreciation on the network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software costs 
during the year ended december   we capitalized  of payroll costs for network operations personnel related to the development of internal use software used to operate and monitor our network 
no payroll costs were capitalized in or cost of revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenue was million for the year ended december  cost of revenue decreased in as compared to primarily as a result of a reduction in traffic delivered over our network  lower bandwidth costs per unit and improved management of our network traffic 
cost of revenue increased in as compared to primarily as a result of an increase in depreciation on network assets and an increase in the amount of traffic delivered over our network 

table of contents cost of revenue is comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage network operations personnel cost of license depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal use software total cost of revenue research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  equity related compensation and related expenses for the design  development  testing and enhancement of our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except certain software development costs eligible for capitalization 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million  net of impairments  of payroll and payroll related costs related to the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
no payroll costs were capitalized in or research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in salaries as a result of reduced headcount and reduced equity related compensation due to employee terminations in the research and development organization and an increase in capitalization of internal use software development costs 
the increase in research and development in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related costs as a result of increases in headcount and an increase in equity related compensation as a result of the issuance of restricted stock at below market value 
these effects are quantified as follows in millions decrease increase in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity compensation capitalization of internal use software development costs other total decrease increase sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  equity related compensation  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and service support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a reduction in payroll  payroll related costs and equity compensation attributable to a reduction in headcount

no payroll costs were capitalized in or general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  reduced payroll related costs as a result of reductions in headcount and reduced rent expense as a result of facility restructurings 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts in compared to reflects an improvement in the financial health of our customer base  reflecting our strategy to target permanent enterprise customers 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in as compared to was due to an increase in provision for doubtful accounts  an increase in payroll and payroll related costs  an increase in facility costs  due to an expansion of our operations  and an increase in depreciation 
depreciation increased in as compared to as a result of increased purchases of property and equipment by us in these effects are quantified as follows in millions decrease increase in general and administrative expenses to to bad debt expense payroll and related costs  including equity compensation rent and facilities depreciation other total decrease increase aggregate research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result of our actions undertaken in to reduce our overall cost structure  including employee severances and lease terminations  we expect aggregate research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative costs to decrease in as compared to amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  amortization of other intangible assets was million for the year ended december  the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in as compared to was primarily due to the discontinuance of assembled workforce amortization in  partially offset by an 
table of contents impairment to intangible assets in the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in compared to was attributable to the recognition of a full year of amortization recorded in due to acquisitions of businesses in we expect to amortize approximately million of intangible assets in amortization of goodwill 
we no longer amortize goodwill as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified assembled workforce intangible assets of approximately million to goodwill 
the resulting balance of goodwill was million on january  for purposes of performing an impairment test  we determined that we had one reporting unit and we assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit as of january  and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of january  and  respectively 
the fair value on january  and exceeded the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill  as of both dates 
accordingly  we concluded that no impairment existed on these dates 
unless changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment test is required  we will next test goodwill for impairment as of january  amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  amortization expense declined between and as a result of an impairment to the balance of goodwill in march restructuring charges 
we recorded restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  these charges included million for employee severance benefits and million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges included million for severance benefits and million for restructuring charges attributable to facility leases and long lived asset impairments 
we did not have restructuring charges in our restructuring expenses are summarized as follows in millions for the year ended december  facility leases severance total for the year ended december   management approved an exit plan for excess and vacant facilities under long term non cancelable leases 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million for the estimated amount of future lease payments and termination fees  less estimated sublease income  for these facilities 
we also impaired million of leasehold improvements located at these facilities 
the impairment was recorded as a non cash restructuring charge 
during  we terminated our facility leases for and technology square in cambridge  massachusetts  at an aggregate cost of million  including brokerage and legal fees 
as of the termination date  the accrued restructuring liability attributable to these leases was million 
accordingly  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million for the difference between the actual termination costs and the amount previously accrued 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges of million representing the difference between the anticipated costs to terminate or modify vacant facilities under non cancelable lease agreements and the previously recorded restructuring liabilities for these properties 
in addition  we impaired leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  deposits  deferred rent and other long lived assets related to these facilities in the amount of million

in the event that these facility leases are terminated at a higher or lower cost than the amount accrued as of december   we will record an adjustment to the restructuring liability in the period in which the adjustment becomes probable and estimable 
if we are not able to successfully terminate or modify these leases  the total payout for these properties would be approximately million over the next seven years  of which million is accrued as of december  impairment of goodwill 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment under the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
we considered several factors in determining whether an impairment may have occurred  including our market capitalization compared to book value  the overall business climate and recent estimates for operating results of acquired businesses 
a review of these factors as of march  indicated that an impairment assessment was required for long lived assets of acquired businesses 
we grouped all long lived assets for acquired businesses  including goodwill and other intangible assets  and estimated the future discounted cash flows related to these long lived assets 
the discount rate used was based on the risks associated with the acquired businesses 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of  million during the first quarter of to adjust the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value as of march  acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development  which we refer to as ipr d  consists of a charge for the value of development projects of acquired businesses in that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the date of business acquisition 
the value of ipr d of million was determined based on each project s stage of development  the time and resources needed for completion  the contribution of core technology and the projected discounted cash flows of completed projects

loss on investments 
loss on investments for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  loss on investments in included a loss of million related to our investment in netaxs  inc  a related party  which was realized as a result of a merger transaction between netaxs and fastnet corporation in april loss on investments includes a gain of  on our sale of our equity interest in akamai technologies japan kk to sbbm 
in addition  loss on investments in consists of a loss of million to adjust the cost basis of equity investments to fair value and approximately  of realized investment gains 
for the year ended december   loss on investments includes a loss of million for the adjustment to market value of equity investments for impairment that was determined to be other than temporary  realized losses of million and a related party loss of million in an investment accounted for under the equity method 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of capital stock and the issuance in april of senior subordinated notes  which we repaid in  totaling approximately million in net proceeds  an initial public offering of our common stock in october that provided million after underwriters discounts and commissions  and the sale in june of million in convertible subordinated notes due july  which generated net proceeds of million 
we have also entered into capital lease agreements to fund the acquisition of property and equipment 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  of which million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash 
cash used in operating activities decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used in operating activities in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in net losses before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  impairment charges  loss on investments and equity related compensation 
cash used in operating expense in as compared to was consistent 
we expect that cash used in operating activities will continue to decline in as a result of actions we undertook in to reduce operating costs  however  the timing and amount of any lease termination payments and other working capital changes will affect the actual amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  reflects net purchases  sales and maturities of investments of million less capital expenditures of million  consisting primarily of leasehold improvements for our new corporate office facility and internal infrastructure purchases  and million for the capitalization of internal use software development costs  net of impaired projects

cash provided by and used in investing activities in and includes million and million used for the purchase of property and equipment  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures  including internal costs for the development of internal use software  to be approximately to of revenue in we may enter into capital lease arrangements or use our available cash to fund these expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  cash 
table of contents provided by financing activities in reflects proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans of million and payments on our capital lease obligations of million 
cash payments on capital lease obligations increased in due to million of new capital leases 
we expect to make payments  including interest  of million in and million thereafter on these lease obligations 
cash received from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans declined in the year ended december  as compared to prior years as a result of fewer option exercises in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  included million in net proceeds from the issuance of million in convertible subordinated notes  due we believe  based on our present business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenditures change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders

off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties  including vendors  customers  landlords  our officers and directors  shareholders of acquired companies  joint venture partners and third parties to whom we license technology
