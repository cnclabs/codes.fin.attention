adjusted earnings adjusted earnings represents net income to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  amortization  gain loss from discontinued operations  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures reflect the company s share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
the company believes that to facilitate a clear understanding of the historical operating results of the company  adjusted earnings should be examined in conjunction with net income as shown in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted earnings should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs or available for distribution to the company s shareholders 
the company s management believes that adjusted earnings more closely approximates operating cash flow and is a useful measure for investors to consider  in conjunction with net income and other gaap measures  in evaluating the company s financial performance 
this is primarily because the company is a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  therefore  the company s net income determined in accordance with gaap reflects significant non cash depreciation expense on corporate tenant lease assets 
it should be noted that the company s manner of calculating adjusted earnings may differ from the calculation of similarly titled measures by other companies

non accrual loans the company transfers loans to non accrual status at such time as management believes that the potential risk exists that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming months  the loans become days delinquent  management determines the borrower is incapable of  or ceased efforts toward  curing the cause of an impairment  or the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates the company s carrying value of such loan 
interest income is recognized only upon actual cash receipt for loans on non accrual status 
as of december   the company had three assets on non accrual status with an aggregate gross book value of million  or of the gross book value of the company s investments 
the company is currently comfortable that it has adequate collateral to support the book values of the assets 
one of the three non accrual loans is a million partnership loan on two shopping malls located in the suburbs of washington  dc this investment was part of a larger loan originally made by affiliates of lazard freres prior to the company s acquisition of lazard s structured finance portfolio in the loan matures in september and bears interest at

however  the company anticipates that this loan will remain on non accrual status for the foreseeable future 
the second non accrual loan is a partnership loan with a balance of million as of december  the loan is presently secured by partnership interests in two partnerships owning facilities in colorado leased to the us government 
the company made the loan in anticipation of buying the facilities upon their completion 
the loan matures on march  and bears interest at libor  with a libor floor of 
in february the borrower breached certain technical provisions of the loan documents  constituting a technical event of default 
the borrower remains current on its regular interest obligations to the company and the company is currently discussing a possible extension of the loan with the borrower 
however  as a result of the technical default and the uncertainty surrounding the extension and the timing of the completion of the facilities for the company s purchase  the loan has been been placed on non accrual status 
the third non accrual loan is a million investment in debt securities of a real estate company which trades on the mexican stock exchange 
this investment was made by trinet prior to its acquisition by the company in the securities bear interest at per annum payable in arrears in december of each year 
in january  the company received cash payments equal to the interest due on the investment through december   and the borrower remains current on its obligations to the company 
however  the company anticipates that this investment will remain on non accrual status for the foreseeable future 
watch list assets the company conducts a quarterly comprehensive credit review  resulting in an individual risk rating being assigned to each asset 
this review is designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively manage asset specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio wide basis as an early warning system 
as of december   the company has four loans and two ctl investments that are on its credit watch list 
in addition to the million partnership loan mentioned above  the company had three other loans on its credit watch list 
the second watch list loan is a million first mortgage secured by a hotel property in new york  new york 
this mortgage matures on april  and bears interest at libor 
the borrower remains current on all of its debt service payments to the company  and the company is currently comfortable that it has adequate collateral to support the book value of the asset 
however  due to poor operating performance exacerbated by the decline in the hotel market in the new york metropolitan area  this loan remains on the watch list 
the third watch list loan is a million junior participation in a first mortgage loan secured by a hotel property in new york  new york 
this loan bears interest at a fixed rate of and matures in june the borrower remains current on all of its debt service payments to the company and has continued to invest additional equity to fund on going capital improvements at the property 
the company is comfortable that it has adequate collateral to support the book value of the asset 
however  due to poor operating performance exacerbated by the decline in the hotel market in the new york metropolitan area  this loan remains on the watch list 
the fourth watch list loan is a million junior interest in a million first mortgage loan secured by a retail shopping mall in chicago  il 
the whole loan bears interest at and matures january  the mall s cash flow has been negatively impacted by the departure of one of four anchor tenants 
the borrower is currently negotiating with one of the anchor tenants to occupy the vacant space 
in addition  the borrower has a significant equity investment in the property including approximately million of additional equity invested in  and remains current on all of its debt service payments to the company 
the company is currently comfortable that it has adequate collateral to support the book value of the asset 
the company also has two ctl investments on its credit watchlist 
in january  a customer occupying two office facilities owned by the company filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the customer utilizes these facilities as the us headquarters for one of its major business lines 
since its bankruptcy filing  the customer has been consolidating its space needs into the larger of the two facilities  including approximately of its employees from other area locations 
the customer has also invested approximately million of its own capital in the facilities 
in december  the bankruptcy court approved a plan of reorganization 
as part of the reorganization  the customer has attempted to affirm the lease on the larger facility and terminate the lease on the smaller facility 
since the two leases are cross defaulted  the company believes the the customer s affirmation of the larger facility lease is also an affirmation of the smaller facility 
the customer remains current on the larger facility s lease payment to the company  but has withheld its march payment on the smaller facility pending a potential negotiated settlement with the company regarding termination of the lease on the smaller facility 
therefore  the smaller facility with a net carrying value of million at december  remains on the company s watch list 
the company also placed on the watch list its investment in a corporate tenant lease asset held in joint venture due to the financial uncertainty surrounding one of the facility s primary tenants 
as of december   the company s equity investment in the venture was million and the company s share of income from this equity investment for the year ended december  was million 
other loans as of december   the company also has a million second mortgage on a class a office building in washington  dc which has paid debt service two months in arrears since december the loan matures in october and  but for a small working capital deficit resulting in the two month arrearage  continues to otherwise pay as agreed 
inclusive of the senior debt on the property  the company s last dollar risk exposure on this asset on a per square foot basis is significantly less than neighboring buildings have sold for 
as a result  the company currently believes that it has adequate collateral to support the book value of the asset 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital to fund its investment activities and operating expenses 
the company has significant access to capital resources to fund its existing business plan  which includes the expansion of its real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing businesses 
the company s capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under lines of credit  additional term borrowings  long term financing secured by the company s assets  unsecured financing and the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
further  the company may acquire other businesses or assets using its capital stock  cash or a combination thereof 
the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code limit the company s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital committed to its operations 
however  the company believes that its significant capital resources and access to financing will provide it with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and corporate tenant leasing transactions 
the company believes that its existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting its short and long term liquidity needs 
the company s ability to meet its long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by the company s lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with the company will depend upon a number of factors  such as compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
the company s longstanding policy is to limit its book debt to equity ratio to approximately x 
as the company s leverage approaches this level  the company will consider equity and other alternatives to reduce leverage 
the exact timing and nature of any equity issuance would be subject to market conditions

hedging activities the company has variable rate lending assets and variable rate debt obligations 
these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that as interest rates increase  the company earns more on its variable rate lending assets and pays more on its variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  the company earns less on its variable rate lending assets and pays less on its variable rate debt obligations 
when the amount of the company s variable rate debt obligations exceeds the amount of its variable rate lending assets  the company utilizes derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income 
the company does not use derivative instruments to hedge assets or for speculative purposes 
the derivatives instruments the company uses are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps effectively change variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition  when appropriate the company may occasionally enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to variable rate in order to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of the fixed rate debt obligations 
the primary risks from the company s use of derivative instruments is the risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that the company may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if a hedging arrangement is terminated by the company 
as a matter of policy  the company enters into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a by standard poor s s p and a by moody s investors service moody s 
the company s hedging strategy is approved and monitored by the company s audit committee on behalf of its board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors without stockholder approval

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps should be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income as part of interest expense in the affected period 
on may   in connection with the stars  series transaction  the company paid a premium of million for an interest rate cap 
using the caplet methodology discussed above  amortization of the cap premium is dependent upon the actual value of the caplets at inception 
in connection with stars  series in may  the company entered into a libor interest rate cap struck at in the notional amount of million  and simultaneously sold a libor interest rate cap with the same terms 
since these instruments did not change the company s net interest rate risk exposure  they did not qualify as hedges and changes in their respective values were charged to earnings 
as the terms of these arrangements were substantially the same  the effects of a revaluation of these two instruments substantially offset one another 
on may   these instruments were settled and are no longer outstanding 
in connection with a portion of the company s fixed rate corporate bonds  the company entered into two pay floating interest rate swaps struck at and and in the notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the company pays one month libor and receives the stated fixed rate in return 
these swaps mitigate the risk of changes in the fair value of million of the company s fixed rate corporate bonds attributable to changes in libor 
for accounting purposes  the difference between the fixed rate received and the libor rate paid on the notional amount of the swap is recorded as interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company adjusts the value of the swap to its fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount on a quarterly basis 
certain of the company s ctl joint ventures  have hedging activities which are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements

the company has certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to its loans and other lending investments that it may need to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which the company has sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those under which the company is generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of the company s direct control 
as of december   the company had nine loans with unfunded commitments totaling million  of which million was discretionary and million was non discretionary 
ratings triggers on july   the company completed a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of leading financial institutions 
the new facility has an initial maturity of july with a one year extension at the company s option and another one year extension at the lenders option 
the new facility replaces two prior credit facilities maturing in and  and bears interest at libor based on the company s senior unsecured credit ratings of bb from s p  ba from moody s and bbb from fitch ratings 
if the company achieves a higher rating from either s p or moody s  the facility s interest rate will improve to libor 
if the company s credit rating is downgraded by any of the rating agencies regardless of how far  the facility s interest rate will increase to libor 
in the event the company receives two credit ratings that are not equivalent  the spread over libor shall be determined by the lower of the two such ratings

if they were consolidated with the company for financial statement purposes  they would not have a material impact on the company s operations 
as of december   istar operating and tmoc have no debt obligations 
the company entered into an employment agreement with its chief executive officer as of march  in addition to the salary and bonus provisions of the agreement  the agreement provides for an award of million phantom units to the executive  each of which notionally represents one share of the company s common stock 
portions of these phantom units will vest on a contingent basis if the average closing price of the company s common stock achieves certain levels ranging from to per share for consecutive calendar days 
contingently vested units will become fully vested  meaning that they are no longer subject to forfeiture  if the executive remains employed through march   or earlier upon certain change of control and termination events 
when and if contingently vested phantom units become fully vested units  the company must deliver to the executive either a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of fully vested units or an amount of cash equal to the then fair market value of that number of shares of common stock 
if shares were unavailable under the company s then long term incentive plans  this obligation could require the company to make a substantial cash payment to the executive 
drip program the company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
under the dividend reinvestment component of the plan  the company s shareholders may purchase additional shares of common stock without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges by automatically reinvesting all or a portion of their common stock cash dividends 
under the direct stock purchase component of the plan  the company s shareholders and new investors may purchase shares of common stock directly from the company without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges 
all purchases of shares in excess of  per month pursuant to the direct purchase component are at the company s sole discretion 
shares issued under the plan may reflect a discount of up to from the prevailing market price of the company s common stock 
the company is authorized to issue up to million shares of common stock pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
during the month periods ended december  and  the company issued a total of million and approximately  shares of its common stock  respectively  through the direct stock purchase component of the plan 
net proceeds during the month periods ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
stock repurchase program the board of directors approved  and the company has implemented  a stock repurchase program under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets or loan repayments and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under its credit facilities if the company determines that it is advantageous to do so 
as of december   the company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares  at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the company did not repurchase any shares under the stock repurchase program in critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant sources of the company s revenue come from its lending operations and its corporate tenant lease operations 
for its lending operations  the company reflects income using the effective yield method  which recognizes periodic income over the expected term of the investment on a constant yield basis 
for corporate tenant lease assets  the company recognizes income on the straight line method  which effectively recognizes contractual lease payments to be received by the company evenly over the term of the lease 
management believes the company s revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
provision for loan losses the company s accounting policies require that an allowance for estimated credit losses be reflected in the financial statements based upon an evaluation of known and inherent risks in its private lending assets 
while the company and its private predecessors have experienced minimal actual losses on their lending investments  management considers it prudent to reflect provisions for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon the company s assessment of general market conditions  the company s internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  the company s assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying its investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets corporate tenant lease assets represent long lived assets for accounting purposes 
the company periodically reviews long lived assets to be held and used in its leasing operations for impairment in value whenever any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in management s opinion  based on this analysis  corporate tenant assets to be held and used are not carried at amounts in excess of their estimated recoverable amounts 
risk management and financial instruments the company has historically utilized derivative financial instruments only as a means to help to manage its interest rate risk exposure on a portion of its variable rate debt obligations ie  as cash flow hedges 
the instruments utilized are generally either pay fixed swaps or libor based interest rate caps which are widely used in the industry and typically with major financial institutions 
the company s accounting policies generally reflect these instruments at their fair value with unrealized changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
realized effects on the company s cash flows are generally recognized currently in income 
however  when appropriate the company may occasionally enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate debt to variable rate in order to mitigate the risk of changes in fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations 
the company reflects these instruments at their fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged liability by an offsetting amount 
income taxes the company s financial results generally do no reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet these requirements  the company would be subject to federal income tax 
executive compensation the company s accounting policies generally provide cash compensation to be estimated and recognized over the period of service 
with respect to stock based compensation arrangements  as of july  with retroactive application to the beginning of the calendar year  the company has adopted the fair value method allowed under sfas no 
 which values options on the date of grant and recognizes an expense equal to the fair value of the option multiplied by the number of options granted over the related service period 
prior to the third quarter  the company elected to use apb accounting  which measured the compensation charges based on the intrinsic value of such securities when they become fixed and determinable  and recognized such expense over the related service period 
these arrangements are often complex and generally structured to align the interests of management with those of the company s shareholders 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of such arrangements and the related accounting effects 
during  the company entered into new three year employment agreements with its chief executive officer and its president 
in addition  during the company entered into a three year employment agreement with its new chief financial officer 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these employment agreements 
the following is a hypothetical illustration of the effects on the company s net income and adjusted earnings of the full vesting of phantom units under the employment agreement with the chief executive officer 
during the months ended december   million of the phantom shares awarded to the chief executive officer were contingently vested 
absent an earlier change of control or termination of employment  these  shares will not become fully vested until march  assuming that the market price of the common stock on march  is which was the market price of the common stock on december   the company would incur a one time charge to both net income and earnings at that time equal to million the fair market value of the  shares at per share 
on april   the  unvested restricted shares awarded to the president became contingently vested as the total shareholder return exceeded and became fully vested on september  as all employment contingencies were met 
the company incurred a non cash charge of approximately million related to these vested shares  recognized ratably over the service period from the date of contingent vesting through september  accordingly  the non cash charge recognized for the months ended december  was approximately million

the transitional disclosure requirements will take effect almost immediately and are required for all financial statements initially issued after january  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing its business plan  the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with its liability management objectives  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
the company s operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on its assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with its interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on the company s interest bearing assets  which the company may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on its borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread the difference in the principal amount outstanding between the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of the company s interest bearing assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of the company s interest earning assets 
a substantial portion of the company s loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to the company 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while the company generally seeks to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  the company could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while the company has not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to the company which adversely affect its liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company employs match funding based hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on its operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps  futures and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce the company s exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes nor as a hedge against changes in credit risk of its borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between the company and a third party the counterparty 
when the company purchases a cap or floor contract  the company makes an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to the company in the future should the reference rate typically one or three month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  the company will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  the company will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
the company utilizes the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps should be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
in general  the company s swaps are pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from the company 
however  when appropriate the company may occasionally enter into pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from the company  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of the company s fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  the company would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  the company would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may freely utilize the types of derivative instruments discussed above to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  prepayment or interest rate exposure on the company s loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  the company may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that the company s profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which the company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
the company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  the company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that the company will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract it enters into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease or basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases as of december   less related interest expense and operating costs on corporate tenant lease assets  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with the company s assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
most of the company s loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties and contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table
