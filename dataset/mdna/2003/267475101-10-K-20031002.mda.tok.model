item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services  including engineering  construction  installation and maintenance services  to telecommunications providers throughout the united states 
we also provide underground locating services to various utilities and electrical and other construction and maintenance services to electrical utilities and others 
for the fiscal year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating and electrical and other construction and maintenance to electric utilities and others contributed approximately  and  respectively  to our total contract revenues 
in february  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of arguss for approximately million shares of our common stock 
the aggregate purchase price  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was approximately million before various transaction costs 
the results of operations of arguss are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we provide a significant portion of our services pursuant to multi year master service agreements 
under master service agreements  we generally agree to provide for a period of one or more years  generally on an exclusive basis  a customer s specified service requirements within a given geographical area 
master service agreements generally provide that we will furnish a specified unit of service for a specified unit price eg  fiber optic cable will be installed underground for a specified rate of dollars per foot 
in some cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with at least days prior written notice 
although historically master service agreements have been awarded through a competitive bidding process  recent trends have been toward securing or extending such contracts on negotiated terms 
we are currently a party to approximately master service agreements 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for particular jobs 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts are generally from three to four months in duration  depending upon the size of the project 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld subject to project completion and acceptance by the customer 
contract revenues from multi year master service agreements represented and of total contract revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and contract revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  represented and of total contract revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue on unit based contracts as the unit is completed 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method based primarily on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
we derive a significant amount of our revenue from telecommunications companies 
beginning in the latter part of calendar year and continuing throughout fiscal and into fiscal  certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered a severe downturn that has resulted in a number of our customers experiencing financial difficulties 
several of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection  including adelphia and worldcom  inc worldcom 
at july   we had pre petition outstanding receivables from adelphia of approximately million after a write down of million 
management determined that the likelihood of payment from worldcom was low and  accordingly  we fully wrote off that receivable of million 
the downturn in the telecommunications industry has adversely affected capital expenditures for infrastructure projects even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties 
generally  capital expenditures by telecommunications customers into fiscal  with the exception of one of our significant customers that is engaged in a major upgrade project  are expected to remain at low levels in comparison with prior years  and there can be no assurance that additional customers will not file for bankruptcy protection or 
table of contents otherwise experience severe financial difficulties 
additional bankruptcies of companies in the telecommunications sector could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total contract revenue received from customers contributing at least of our total contract revenue for either fiscal or for the year ended july  july  comcast bellsouth sprint directv qwest adelphia charter alltel comcast and at t broadband revenues have been combined for periods prior to comcast s november  acquisition of at t broadband 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including all costs of construction personnel  subcontractor costs  all costs associated with operation of equipment excluding depreciation  insurance and materials not supplied by the customer 
generally the customer provides the materials that are to be used for its job 
because we retain the risk for automobile and general liability  worker s compensation  and employee group health claims subject to certain limits  a change in experience or actuarial assumptions could materially affect results of operations in a particular period 
general and administrative costs include all our costs at the parent company level  as well as subsidiary management personnel and administrative overhead 
our management personnel  including subsidiary management  perform substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material selling expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  self insured claims liability  income taxes  intangible assets  investments  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on current information  historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recognition of revenue that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with our audit committee 
for a further discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the majority of our contracts are unit based 
revenue on unit based contracts is recognized as the unit is completed 
revenue on non unit based contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method based primarily on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  classified as a current asset  primarily relates to revenues for completed but unbilled units under unit based contracts  as well as unbilled revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method for non unit based contracts 
for those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date  such excesses are classified as a current liability in the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
estimation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that the receivable has been impaired at the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends and considers changes in customer payment terms and other factors when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as an accrued liability 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  expected cost for existing and anticipated claims  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
in addition  we retain the risk  up to certain limits  under a self insured employee health plan 
we periodically review the paid claims history of our employee health plan and analyze our accrued liability for claims  including claims incurred but not yet paid 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued under the employee health plan include  but are not limited to  frequency of use  changes in medical costs  unfavorable jury decisions  legislative changes  changes in the medical conditions of claimants  court interpretations and economic factors such as inflation 
for losses occurring during fiscal year and for the next fiscal year  we have retained the risk on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability to  for general liability to  and for worker s compensation  in states where we are allowed to retain risk  to  for fiscal year  we had aggregate stop loss coverage for the above exposures at the stated retention of approximately million 
this stop loss coverage will be for our next fiscal year in addition  we have umbrella liability coverage to a policy limit for each year of million 
within the umbrella coverage  we have retained the risk of loss between and million  on a per occurrence basis  with an aggregate stop loss for this layer of million for each of fiscal years and the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for automobile  general liability and workers compensation and employee group health claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what we use to calculate the accrued liability  we would have to record expenses in excess of what we have already accrued 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with that statement  we conduct  on at least an annual basis  a review of our reporting units to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the 
table of contents case  the value of our goodwill may be impaired and is written down 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
when necessary  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
impairment losses are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for its income tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
on september   as amended on november  and june   williams communications llc williams filed suit against one of our subsidiaries  niels fugal sons company nfs  in the united states district court of the northern district of oklahoma for claims that included breach of contract with respect to fiber optic cable installation projects that nfs had constructed for williams 
on may   nfs entered into a settlement agreement with williams and certain other parties pursuant to which this lawsuit was dismissed and all related claims were released 
the terms of the settlement of this lawsuit had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in the ordinary course of our business we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
where there is a range of loss  we record the minimum estimated liability related to those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined

costs of earned revenues increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to from 
the primary components of this percentage increase were subcontractor costs  which increased  and insurance costs  which increased  partially offset by a decrease in labor and payroll related costs of 
subcontractor costs rose on a percentage basis as the mix of business shifted toward operating units that utilize more subcontract labor 
insurance costs have trended up as a consequence of higher premiums and losses associated with our casualty and health insurance programs 
labor and payroll related costs decreased as a percentage of contract revenues due to reductions in staffing based on work requirements 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended july  as compared to the year ended july   was primarily attributable to increased overhead related to the arguss acquisition and increases in professional fees of million related to a review and reorganization of our corporate structure and increased legal expenses  partially offset by a decrease in payroll related expenses of million

the decrease in our telecommunications service revenues is attributable to lower revenues  primarily from telecommunication and cable customers  due in part to the continued decrease in capital spending by our customers  bankruptcies of certain customers  and the overall downturn in the economy

net loss income 
net loss was million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources capital requirements 
our primary capital needs are for equipment to support our contractual commitments to customers and to maintain sufficient working capital 
we have typically financed capital expenditures by operating and capital leases  bank borrowings and internal cash flows 
our sources of cash have historically been operating activities  equity offerings  bank borrowings  and proceeds from the sale of idle and surplus equipment and real property 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  our capital requirements may increase 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at july  compared to million at july  year ended in millions july  july  july  net cash flows provided by operations used in investment activities provided by used in financing activities cash from operating activities 
for the year ended july   net cash provided from operating activities was million compared to cash provided of million and million for the years ended july  and july   respectively 
net income  adjusted for non cash items primarily consisting of depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes and provision for bad debts  was our main source of operating cash flow and was offset in part by changes in working capital items that used million of operating cash flow during the year ended july  primarily driving this working capital use is an increase in accounts receivable of million 
in addition to the increase in accounts receivable  the changes in working capital included an increase in other assets of million  primarily as a result of a payment recorded as a prepaid discount made to a customer related to a long term contract  a decrease in accounts payable of million and a decrease in customer advances of million primarily due to the application of a customer advance to outstanding receivables 
these changes were offset by a million increase in accrued insurance and other liabilities  including an increase in accrued income taxes 
based on quarterly revenues  days sales outstanding was days for the current quarter ending july  compared to days for the quarter ended july   for current accounts receivable  net 
the increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding can primarily be attributed to an increase in the mix of customers with longer payment terms 
during the fourth quarter  two of our major customers  adelphia and worldcom  filed for bankruptcy protection 
at july   we had long term accounts receivables of million from 
table of contents adelphia  representing the remaining balance of pre petition receivables of million less million that was written off against a previously established allowance for doubtful accounts 
worldcom s long term accounts receivables of million were written off entirely 
should any additional customers file for bankruptcy or experience financial difficulties  or if our efforts to recover outstanding receivables fail  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided 
in addition  material changes in our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
cash from investing activities 
for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million as compared to million in fiscal during the year ended july   cash used in investing activities was primarily for capital expenditures of million compared to million in the prior year  offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of million and million for fiscal year and  respectively 
cash from financing activities 
for the year ended july   net cash provided by financing activities  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options  was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended july  during fiscal  we used million to repay notes payable  million of which related to the repayment of indebtedness of arguss subsequent to its acquisition 
on june   we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides us with a commitment of million for a three year period and includes a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
under the most restrictive covenants of our credit agreement  as of july   our available borrowing capacity is approximately million 
as of july  we had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and million of outstanding letters of credit 
the outstanding letters of credit are all issued to our insurance companies as part of our self insurance program 
loans under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at the bank s prime interest rate or libor plus a spread of  or based upon our current leverage ratio 
based on our current leverage ratio  borrowings would be eligible for the spread 
we are required to pay an annual non utilization fee equal to of the unused portion of the facilities 
in addition  we pay an annual agent fee of  under the credit agreement  we are subject to certain financial covenants and conditions  which restrict our ability to encumber our assets or incur certain types of indebtedness 
we must maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than  as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
at july   this leverage ratio  defined as consolidated funded debt including any outstanding letters of credit divided by consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  was 
at july   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and conditions under the credit agreement 
certain subsidiaries have outstanding obligations under real estate leases and equipment and vehicle financing arrangements 
the obligations are payable in monthly installments  expiring at various dates through november interest costs incurred on notes payable  all of which were expensed  during the year ended july  were  the following tables set forth our contractual commitments for each of our fiscal years through and thereafter  including related party leases  as of july  contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating leases total

the total expense under these arrangements for the years ended july   july   and july  was   and  respectively 
the future minimum lease commitments under these arrangements during each fiscal year through fiscal and thereafter are thereafter total stock repurchase program 
on february   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million worth of the company s common stock over an eighteen month period 
such repurchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
this plan does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock  and the plan may be suspended at any time 
pursuant to florida law  any shares repurchased will be added to the company s authorized  unissued shares and are available for future issue 
no shares have been repurchased under this program as of september  we believe that our capital resources  together with existing cash balances  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations  operating lease commitments  and to support our normal replacement of equipment at our current level of business for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our continued ability to manage controllable costs effectively 
backlog 
our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts 
our backlog at july  and july  was million and million  respectively 
we expect to complete approximately of our current backlog during the next twelve months 
in many instances our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under a contract 
however  the customer is obligated to obtain these services from us if they are not performed by the customer s employees and we are committed to perform these services if requested by the customer 
many of these contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with customers and our experience in procurements of this nature 
there can be no assurance  however  as to a customer s requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are accurate 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues can be affected by seasonality 
since most of the work we perform is done outdoors  our results of operations can be impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather occurs during the winter months or in our second and third quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  a disproportionate number of holidays fall within our second quarter impacting our productivity 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

we do not have any interests in variable interest entities
