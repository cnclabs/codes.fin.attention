item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
williams energy partners lp is a publicly traded limited partnership formed by the williams companies  inc williams to own  operate and acquire a diversified portfolio of complementary energy assets 
we are principally engaged in the transportation  storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and ammonia 
our current asset portfolio consists of the williams pipe line system  five marine terminal facilities  inland terminals some of which are partially owned  and an ammonia pipeline system 
on april   we acquired for approximately billion all of the membership interests of williams pipe line company williams pipe line from a wholly owned subsidiary of williams 
williams pipe line owns and operates the williams pipe line system 
because williams pipe line was an affiliate of ours at the time of the acquisition  the transaction was between entities under common control and  as such  was accounted for similar to a pooling of interest 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements and notes have been restated to reflect the historical results of operations  financial position and cash flows of williams energy partners and williams pipe line on a combined basis throughout the periods presented 
the historical results for the williams pipe line system include revenue and expenses and assets and liabilities that were conveyed to and assumed by an affiliate of williams pipe line prior to our acquisition of it 
these assets primarily include williams pipe line s interest in and agreements related to longhorn partners pipeline longhorn  an inactive refinery at augusta  kansas  a pipeline construction project  the atlas software system and the pension asset and obligations associated with the non contributory defined benefit pension plan that covered employees assigned to williams pipe line s operations 
the results from these assets have not been included in our financial results since our acquisition of williams pipe line in april in addition  revenues from williams pipe line s blending operations  other than an annual blending fee of approximately million  have not been included in our financial results since april we report the williams pipe line system s operations as a separate operating segment 
recent developments during  williams began to experience significant financial and liquidity difficulties and no longer maintains an investment grade credit rating 
in the event that williams financial condition does not improve or worsens it may have to consider other options including the possibility of filing for bankruptcy under the united states bankruptcy code 
management believes that should williams and its affiliates file for bankruptcy protection that we would not necessarily become a party to such bankruptcy filings 
however  we cannot assure you that williams and its affiliates  or the creditors of williams and its affiliates  would not attempt to utilize various remedies available in a bankruptcy including substantive consolidation  in an effort to make our assets available to the creditors of williams and its affiliates  or how a bankruptcy court would resolve such issues 
likewise  there can be no assurances as to the ultimate impact a bankruptcy by williams and its affiliates would have on their ability to perform obligations owed to us  including our general partner 
weg gp llc  our general partner general partner  is a wholly owned subsidiary of williams 
combined with its limited partnership interest  williams owns approximately of us 
however  we operate our business in a manner separate and distinct from williams 
among other things  i we either own or lease 
table of contents the assets used in our business in our own name  ii we have three independent board members who serve on a conflicts committee that must approve any material transaction between williams or its affiliates and us  as well as approve certain significant transactions such as the filing of a bankruptcy petition and iii other than affiliate receivables and payables generated from product sales and services rendered in the normal course of business  we do not provide any credit support to williams or its affiliates and williams does not provide credit support to us 
provisions of the general partner s limited liability company agreement specifically provide that  decisions regarding a voluntary bankruptcy filing of weg gp llc or us must be approved by our conflicts committee 
our conflicts committee is comprised of the independent board members of weg gp llc 
on february   williams announced its intention to divest its interest in our general partner and all of its limited partnership interests 
it is uncertain what form this potential transaction may take and management cannot currently assess what impact such an acquisition would have on our on going operations

overview the williams pipe line system 
the williams pipe line system is a common carrier transportation pipeline and terminals network 
the system generates approximately of its revenues  excluding the sale of petroleum products  through transportation tariffs for volumes of petroleum products it ships 
these tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates  where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts 
all transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
williams pipe line also earns revenues from non tariff based activities  including leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers on a long term basis and by providing data services and product services such as ethanol unloading and loading  additive injection  custom blending and laboratory testing for our customers 
prior to our acquisition of it in april  williams pipe line generally did not produce or trade refined petroleum products or liquid propane gases or take title to the products it transported 
the system generates small volumes of product by blending natural gas liquids with gasoline and by fractionating transmix  which is a mixture of products resulting from the intermingling of different product grades during normal operation of the pipeline 
williams pipe line purchased and took title to the inventories associated with blending and fractionation until the processed product has been sold 
in connection with the acquisition of williams pipe line  we  and an affiliate of williams agreed that williams pipe line would no longer take title to the natural gas liquids it blends with gasoline or the resulting product 
we continue to perform these blending services for affiliates of williams under a ten year agreement for an annual fee that will increase to approximately million in in addition  we perform blending services at our little rock  arkansas inland terminals  which generate annual blending fees of approximately million 
as a result  total revenues generated from blending services in will be approximately million 
we continue to purchase and fractionate transmix and to sell the resulting separated products 
operating costs and expenses incurred by the williams pipe line system are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance and system integrity as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with volumes transported and stored on the system 
expenses resulting from environmental remediation projects have historically included costs from projects relating both to current and past events 
in connection with our acquisition of williams pipe line  williams energy services generally agreed to indemnify us for costs and expenses relating to environmental remediation for events that occurred before april  and are discovered within six years from that date 
please read business environmental 
petroleum products terminals 
within our terminals network  we operate two types of terminals marine terminal facilities and inland terminals 
the marine terminal facilities are large product storage facilities that generate revenues primarily from fees that we charge customers for storage and throughput services 
the inland terminals earn revenues primarily from fees that we charge based on the volumes of refined petroleum products distributed from these terminals 
the inland terminals also earn ancillary revenues 
table of contents from injecting additives into gasoline and jet fuel  filtering jet fuel and delivering product to the dallas love field airport 
also included in ancillary revenues is the gain or loss resulting from differences in metered versus physical volumes of refined petroleum products received at our terminals 
operating costs and expenses that we incur in our marine and inland terminals are principally fixed costs related to routine maintenance as well as field and support personnel 
other costs  including power  fluctuate with storage utilization or throughput levels 
ammonia pipeline system 
the ammonia pipeline system earns the majority of its revenue from transportation tariffs that we charge for transporting ammonia through the pipeline 
we have entered into a new agreement with enterprise products partners lp enterprise to operate our ammonia system  which will increase our operating expenses by approximately million annually also  enterprise will charge us million annually for general and administrative expenses associated with their operation of this pipeline 
management believes that the general and administrative costs will be subject to the expense limitation under our omnibus agreement 
please read item certain relationships and related transactions omnibus agreement 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses are provided by and paid to williams as defined by the omnibus agreement 
general and administrative expenses include functions such as commercial operations  engineering  information technology  finance  accounting  human resources and other corporate services 
through a change of control or with days written notice  williams can terminate its obligations to provide services to us  which would also eliminate williams obligations under the general and administrative expense limitation included in the omnibus agreement 
in connection with our initial public offering  and with respect solely to the petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline assets we owned at the time of that offering  we and our general partner agreed with williams that the general and administrative expenses to be reimbursed to our general partner by us would not exceed million for  excluding expenses associated with our long term incentive plans 
the reimbursement limitation will remain in place through and may increase by no more than the greater of per year or the percentage increase in the consumer price index for that year 
if we make an acquisition  general and administrative expenses may also increase by the amount of these expenses included in the valuation of the business acquired 
for  the general and administrative limitation was increased to million 
in connection with our acquisition of the williams pipe line system  we and our general partner agreed with williams that the general and administrative expenses to be reimbursed to our general partner by us for charges related to this asset would be million for  pro rated for the actual period that we owned williams pipe line 
in each year after  these expenses may increase by the lesser of per year or the percentage increase in the consumer price index for that year 
for  the general and administrative limitation was increased to million 
in addition  costs will increase by another million for general and administrative costs associated with the rio grande pipeline  which we began operating in february we expect the general and administrative expenses paid to williams to be million before equity based long term incentive plans and adjustments for additional acquisitions 
please read risks related to our business for additional discussion of potential changes in our general and administrative costs as a result of a sale by williams of their interest in us 
management estimates that the actual general and administrative costs required for our operations of the partnership on a stand alone basis could significantly exceed this million amount  due in part to significant increases in insurance premiums and increased general and administrative costs on the ammonia pipeline system associated with the new enterprise operating contract  as well as our new agreement to operate the rio grande pipeline 

table of contents acquisition history we have materially increased our operations through a series of transactions since our initial public offering in february including in april  the acquisition of the williams pipe line system from a subsidiary of williams  in december  the acquisition of a natural gas liquids pipeline in illinois from aux sable liquid products lp  in october  the acquisition of a marine crude oil terminal facility in gibson  louisiana from geonet gathering  inc  in june  the acquisition of two inland refined petroleum products terminals in little rock  arkansas from transmontaigne  inc  and in april  the acquisition of a refined petroleum products pipeline in dallas  texas from equilon pipeline company llc

this increase was a result of an increase in williams pipe line system s transportation and related activities revenues of million  or 
transportation revenues increased between periods due to higher weighted average tariffs that more than offset slightly lower shipments 
the tariffs were higher due to a mid year rate increase and our customers transporting products longer distances 
these longer hauls resulted primarily from supply shifts within our pipeline system during the latter part of caused by temporary reductions of a refinery s production on our system 
further  increased rates for data services as well as higher ethanol loading and storage volumes resulted in additional revenue  an increase in petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily due to the acquisitions of our gibson marine terminal facility in october and two little rock inland terminals in june an improved marketing environment resulted in higher utilization and rates at our gulf coast facilities  further increasing revenues during  and a decrease in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  primarily due to a throughput deficiency billing in the prior year that resulted from a shipper s inability to meet its minimum annual throughput commitment for the contract year ended june in addition  revenue also declined due to significantly reduced volumes from one of our shippers following its filing for chapter bankruptcy during may partially offsetting these decreases was a higher weighted average tariff of in compared to during the prior year 
operating expenses including environmental expenses net of environmental indemnifications from williams and excluding product purchases were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was a result of a decrease in williams pipe line system expenses of million  or  primarily due to lower environmental and maintenance expenses and reduced power costs 
environmental costs were lower due to the indemnification from an affiliate of williams for environmental issues resulting from operations prior to our ownership of the pipeline 
maintenance expenses declined due to improved cost controls as a result of the implementation of a consistent and disciplined expense decision making process 
reduced power costs resulted from lower volumes transported coupled with reduced power rates 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in pipeline lease expenses  which represent 
table of contents tariffs paid on connecting pipelines to move a customer s product to its ultimate destination 
the customer reimburses us through the transportation tariff for this service which began in the current year  hence there are no associated pipeline lease expenses in the prior year  an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  primarily due to the addition of the gibson marine facility and the little rock inland terminals and increased maintenance expenses resulting from timing of tank cleaning and api inspections at the inland terminals  and an increase in ammonia pipeline system expenses of million  or  primarily due to the purchase in the current year of right of way easements that have historically been leased and higher property taxes 
revenues from williams pipe line product sales were million for the year ended december   while product purchases were million  resulting in a net margin of million in the net margin represents a decrease of million compared to a net margin in of million resulting from product sales for the year ended december  of million and product purchases of million 
the margin decline in reflects our agreement with an affiliate of williams to provide blending services for them for an annual fee of million 
as a result of this agreement  we no longer generate a commodity margin in butane blending related activities 
revenues from petroleum products terminal product sales were million in and million in affiliate construction and management fee revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  historically  williams pipe line received a fee to manage longhorn and to provide consulting services associated with the pipeline s construction and start up  as needed 
prior to our acquisition of williams pipe line  the obligation to provide this service for longhorn was transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary of williams 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  representing a million decrease from at million 
additional depreciation associated with acquisitions and capital improvements were more than offset by the elimination of depreciation associated with assets we did not acquire as part of the williams pipe line acquisition 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
general and administrative expenses are paid to williams as defined by the omnibus agreement 
for  subsequent to the williams pipe line acquisition  general and administrative expenses were limited to million per quarter plus equity based incentive compensation expenses 
incentive compensation costs associated with our long term incentive plan are specifically excluded from the expense limitation and were million during and million during the incentive compensation costs included million associated with the early vesting of the phantom units issued to key employees at the time of our initial public offering 
the early vesting was triggered as a result of meeting targets for our growth in cash distributions paid to unitholders 
prior to our acquisition of williams pipe line  this operating unit was allocated general and administrative costs from williams based on a three factor formula that considers operating margin  payroll costs and property  plant and equipment 
the amount of general and administrative costs we pay will continue to be adjusted in the future to reflect additional general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions as well as the annual adjustments allowed by the omnibus agreement 
through a change of control or with days written notice  williams can terminate its obligations to provide services to us  which would also eliminate williams obligations under the general and administrative expense limitation included in the omnibus agreement 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily related to the long term debt financing of williams pipe line 
although the weighted average interest rates decreased from in to in  the weighted average debt outstanding increased from million in to million in 
table of contents we do not pay income taxes because we are a partnership 
however  williams pipe line was subject to income taxes prior to our acquisition of it in april  and our pre initial public offering earnings in were also taxable 
taxes on these earnings were at income tax rates of and for the year ended december  and  respectively  based on the effective income tax rate for williams as a result of williams tax sharing arrangement with its subsidiaries 
the effective income tax rate exceeds the us federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating margin increased by million during the period  largely as a result of increased revenues and reduced operating expenses including environmental expenses net of indemnifications from williams for williams pipe line  earnings from the acquisitions of the little rock and gibson terminal facilities and increased utilization and rates at our gulf coast marine facilities 
depreciation expense and general and administrative expenses decreased by million and million  respectively  while net interest expense increased by million 
debt placement fee amortization expense increased million primarily due to costs from debt financing associated with the williams pipe line acquisition 
other income increased million primarily due to i gain on the sale of assets and ii an impairment charge recorded during related to the inactive refinery site at augusta  kansas  the assets and liabilities of which were not transferred to us as part of the williams pipe line acquisition

this increase was primarily a result of an increase in williams pipe line system s transportation and related revenues of million  or  primarily due to higher transportation revenues  partially offset by a decrease in revenues from product services 
the increase in transportation revenues resulted from increased volumes and mid year tariff increases 
transportation volumes increased in part due to system expansions made to secure new volumes from customers 
volumes also increased as a result of additional volume incentive agreements and general demand increases for gasoline and distillates  slightly offset by a decrease in demand for aviation fuel resulting from the recession and consumer reaction to the terrorist attacks of september  product services decreased primarily due to a reduction in additive injection revenues resulting from lower prices for these services under new agreements  an increase in the petroleum products terminals revenues of million  or  primarily a result of the acquisitions of our new haven marine terminal facility in september  two little rock inland terminals in june and the gibson marine terminal facility in october an improved marketing environment resulted in higher utilization at our gulf coast marine facilities 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in inland terminals revenues  primarily due to the december expiration of a customer s contractual commitment to utilize a specified amount of throughput capacity  and 
table of contents an increase in ammonia pipeline system revenues of million  or  partly due to a throughput deficiency billing that resulted from a shipper s inability to meet its minimum annual throughput commitment for the contract year ended june in addition  warm fall weather and a return to historically average prices for natural gas  which is the primary component for the production of ammonia  combined to create favorable conditions for the application of ammonia during the fourth quarter of  resulting in a  ton  or  increase in volume shipped on the pipeline compared to the weighted average tariff increased from in to in operating expenses including environmental expenses net of indemnifications from williams and excluding product purchases and construction expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase was a result of an increase in williams pipe line system s expenses of million  or  primarily caused by increased maintenance and power expenses 
maintenance costs were higher due to increased expenditures associated with our system integrity program  which is designed to ensure compliance with increased safety regulations 
this program includes increased emphasis on pipeline inspections and api tank inspections 
power expense increased due to higher transportation volumes and higher power rates 
partially offsetting these increases were lower environmental and less casualty loss expense 
environmental expenses were less due to higher costs recognized in related to the inactive refinery site at augusta  kansas  assets and liabilities of which were not transferred to us as part of the williams pipe line acquisition 
casualty losses decreased due to higher costs recognized in associated with a groundwater contamination lawsuit that was settled in  and an increase in petroleum products terminals expenses of million  or  due primarily to the acquisitions of the new haven marine terminal facility in september  the little rock inland terminals in june and the gibson marine terminal facility in october expenses at the other gulf coast marine terminal facilities increased slightly due to higher utility costs  partially offset by lower environmental and maintenance expenses  while property taxes at some inland terminals increased

we reimburse the general partner and its affiliates for direct and indirect expenses incurred by or allocated to them on our behalf 
net interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of a decline in affiliate notes payable to williams and lower interest rates 
the affiliate note payable associated with the williams pipe line system declined as a result of a partial repayment using cash generated from operations in excess of capital expenditures 
the affiliate note payable associated with the petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system was partially repaid and the balance was contributed to us as capital in connection with our initial public offering in february at the end of  we had million outstanding under a term loan and revolving credit facility 
we do not pay income taxes because we are a partnership 
we primarily based our income tax rate of for our pre initial public offering earnings from our petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline businesses upon the effective income tax rate for williams as a result of williams tax sharing arrangement with its subsidiaries

other known trends or events we have significant relationships with williams  the owner of our general partner  farmland industries  inc farmland and other third party entities that impact our operating results 
williams has completed a number of asset sales and entered into secured debt agreements to address its liquidity needs  and farmland has filed for bankruptcy 
our relationships with these two entities are described below williams during the past year  williams has experienced financial and liquidity difficulties and currently does not have an investment grade credit rating 
these financial difficulties have raised questions concerning williams ability to meet its existing financial obligations 
however  williams has not filed for bankruptcy protection and neither williams  weg gp llc  nor any other williams affiliate has advised us of any intention by williams  any williams affiliate or our general partner to place williams or our general partner into bankruptcy 
we are engaged contractually with williams on several fronts  including commercial relationships  contracted services and indemnities 
the extent of these relationships include williams is the owner of our general partner and its ownership interest in us is approximately  including its general partner interest  
table of contents williams is a customer  representing approximately of our revenues 
we expect to replace a majority of these revenues without significant impact to our results of operations if williams is unable to perform on its existing obligations 
williams provides various services for us 
through these services  williams operates our assets and provides general and administrative functions 
all employees supporting our partnership are employees of williams 
we pay the cost for the operating expenses associated with our assets  and we incur an additional cost for general and administrative services  which are limited under the omnibus agreement to approximately million per year 
management estimates that actual general and administrative costs required for our operation could be significantly higher due in part to increases in insurance premiums and increased general and administrative costs for the ammonia pipeline associated with the new enterprise operating contract 
for the year ended  williams incurred million of general and administrative charges in excess of the amount specified under terms of the omnibus agreement 
some of the charges did not relate to services essential for our ongoing operations 
through a change of control or with days written notice  williams can terminate its obligations to provide services to us  which would also eliminate williams obligations under the general and administrative expense limitation included in the omnibus agreement  and for assets included in our initial public offering  williams agreed to provide maintenance capital reimbursements for expenditures in excess of million during and we received total reimbursement of million for maintenance capital spent during the period of the agreement 
in addition  williams has agreed to pay maintenance capital associated with the williams pipe line system in excess of million per year for  and up to a cumulative maximum of million 
we expect to spend less than million annually for maintenance capital for the williams pipe line system and do not expect any maintenance capital reimbursement from williams associated with this asset 
affiliates of williams have provided various indemnifications to us 
please read critical accounting estimates environmental liabilities and critical accounting estimates affiliate receivables 
change of control on february   williams announced its intention to divest its interest in our general partner and all of its limited partnership interests 
upon completion of this proposed divestiture  the resulting change of control may lead to the following results termination of our omnibus agreement with williams or termination of williams obligation to provide general and administrative services for a fixed charge  which could result in higher general and administrative expenses and cessation of the environmental indemnification for the assets acquired at the time of our initial public offering  acceleration of principal payments on outstanding debt  initial increase in the allocation of taxable income to our unitholders  and early vesting of phantom units issued as part of our long term incentive compensation plan 
it is uncertain what form the sale of williams interests may take and management is unable  at this time  to determine what impact such a transaction will have on our ongoing operations 
farmland farmland filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on may  farmland is the largest customer on our ammonia pipeline system 
farmland also owns and operates a refinery in coffeyville  kansas  with its products marketed primarily through a third party that ships on williams pipe line 
this third party shipper is not affiliated with either farmland or williams 
combined total revenues associated with farmland s ammonia shipments and the use of the williams pipe line system to transport products from the farmland refinery were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  or and of total revenues for and  respectively 
demand for products from farmland s coffeyville  kansas refinery have continued to be strong and we expect that this demand will remain so for the foreseeable future 
also  we believe that farmland will either continue to operate its 
table of contents coffeyville  kansas refinery or will sell it to a third party who will continue its operation 
please read ammonia pipeline system customers and contracts farmland for additional information 
farmland s ammonia pipeline agreement provided for the right to terminate its shipment obligation by submitting month written notice to us  which they have done 
farmland s notification will be effective december  farmland has indicated that its ammonia production facility connected to our pipeline is for sale and has thus elected to exercise its termination right effective december  farmland is expected to incur a deficiency of approximately million to million under its shipment obligation for the contract year ending june  on february   we entered into a settlement agreement with farmland to resolve its deficiency 
under the settlement agreement  farmland will pay us million for the deficiency it will incur under its shipment obligation for the contract year ending june  if farmland assigns its shipment obligation to a purchaser of its ammonia assets pursuant to bankruptcy procedures  farmland s termination notice will be withdrawn  and the shipment obligation will be reduced from  tons annually to  tons annually 
the settlement agreement is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
if the bankruptcy court does not approve the settlement agreement by june   it will be void unless we agree with farmland to extend the time for approval 
if the settlement agreement is not approved and farmland rejects its shipment obligation pursuant to bankruptcy procedures  we will have a general  unsecured creditor s claim against farmland for the deficiency it will incur under its shipment obligation for the contract year ending june  and for any deficiency incurred under its shipment obligation for the contract period beginning july  and ending december  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million for net income for benefited from higher revenues and reduced expenses for the williams pipe line system and greater terminals profits due to the little rock and gibson acquisitions and higher utilization at the gulf coast facilities 
the reduction in income taxes more than offset the increased interest expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities provided additional net cash 
inventories decreased during due to the elimination of butane blending inventories as we now perform butane blending as a service provider without carrying the relevant inventory 
as part of our acquisition of the williams pipe line system  williams retained million of its accounts receivables and the affiliate payables 
therefore  accounts receivables and affiliate payables increased during as they were replaced as part of the ongoing operations of that business 
further  increases in affiliate receivables were primarily offset by increases in environmental liabilities due to the indemnification from williams for environmental liabilities occurring prior to our ownership of the williams pipe line system 
net income increased from to due to the acquisition of our new haven  little rock and gibson terminals and reduced interest expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities also impacted cash from operations 
accounts receivable significantly declined due to the collection of receivables related to reimbursable construction projects 
in addition  affiliate receivables declined due to the collection of a large outstanding short term affiliate receivable due from an affiliate of williams 
inventories increased between periods due to higher commodity prices during further  changes to other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities resulted from collection of unbilled reimbursable construction projects at year end and long term affiliate receivables related to reimbursable longhorn construction costs 
net cash used by investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

net cash provided used by financing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the cash provided during principally included the debt and equity funding that were completed in conjunction with our acquisition of williams pipe line 
cash was used in to repay affiliate notes associated with our initial public offering assets as well as payments made by williams pipe line to decrease its affiliate note balance  partially offset by proceeds from debt borrowings and equity issued in our initial public offering and subsequent debt borrowings for acquisitions 
the cash inflow primarily represents affiliate loans we received from williams to fund our terminal acquisitions  partially offset by repayments of the affiliate note payable associated with williams pipe line using free cash flow generated by the system 
federal energy regulatory commission notice of proposed rulemaking on august   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that  if adopted  would amend its uniform systems of accounts for public utilities  natural gas companies and oil pipeline companies by requiring specific written documentation concerning the management of funds from a ferc regulated subsidiary by a non ferc regulated parent 
under the proposed rule  as a condition for participating in a cash management or money pool arrangement  the ferc regulated entity would be required to maintain a minimum proprietary capital balance stockholder s equity or partners capital of  and the ferc regulated entity and its parent would be required to maintain investment grade credit ratings 
if either of these conditions is not met  the ferc regulated entity would not be eligible to participate in the cash management or money pool arrangement 
as of december   all of our debt was issued to private lenders and is not rated  therefore  we do not currently meet the second requirement 
the period for interested companies to make comments to the ferc relative to this proposed rule has ended  and the ferc is evaluating its position on the issue 
we do not know when or if the rule will be enacted 
however  we have established separate bank accounts for williams pipe line and we believe we could easily comply with the proposed rule 
capital requirements the transportation  storage and distribution business requires continual investment to upgrade or enhance existing operations and to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations 
the capital requirements of our businesses consist primarily of maintenance capital expenditures  such as those required to maintain equipment reliability and safety and to address environmental regulations  and payout capital expenditures to acquire additional complementary assets to grow our business and to expand or upgrade our existing facilities  such as projects that increase storage or throughput volumes or develop pipeline connections to new supply sources 
williams agreed to reimburse us for maintenance capital expenditures incurred in and in excess of million per year related to our initial public offering assets 
this reimbursement obligation was subject to a maximum combined reimbursement for both years of million 
during and  we recorded reimbursements from williams associated with these assets of million and million  respectively 
in connection with our acquisition of williams pipe line  williams has agreed to reimburse us for maintenance capital expenditures incurred in  and in excess of million per year related to the williams pipe line system  subject to a maximum combined reimbursement for all years of million 
our maintenance capital expenditure expectations related to the williams pipe line system are less than million per year and we do not anticipate reimbursement by williams 
during  our maintenance capital spending net of reimbursements was million 
we expect to incur maintenance capital expenditures for for all of our businesses of million 

table of contents in addition to maintenance capital expenditures  we also incur payout capital expenditures at our existing facilities for expansion and upgrade opportunities 
during  we spent million of payout capital  excluding acquisitions 
based on projects currently in process  we plan to spend approximately million of payout capital in this amount does not include capital expenditures made in connection with any future acquisitions 
we expect to fund our payout capital expenditures  including any acquisitions  from cash provided by operations  borrowings under the revolving credit facility discussed below and other borrowings  and the issuance of additional common units 
if capital markets tighten and we are unable to fund these expenditures  our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to acquire additional assets and businesses 
liquidity williams pipe line senior secured notes 
in connection with the financing of the williams pipe line system acquisition  we and our subsidiary  williams pipe line company  entered into a note purchase agreement on october  the private placement allowed for two separate borrowings i million to be used to repay the williams pipe line short term loan and related debt placement fees and ii million for general corporate purposes 
we borrowed a total of million under the debt agreement 
the incremental million was used primarily to repay the outstanding acquisition sub facility of the olp term loan and credit facility  described below 
the williams pipe line borrowing included series a and series b notes 
the maturity date of both notes is october   with scheduled prepayments equal to of the outstanding balance due on both october  and october  the debt is secured by our membership interests in and the assets of williams pipe line 
payment of interest and principal is guaranteed by williams energy partners lp the series a notes include million of borrowings that incur interest based on the six month eurodollar rate plus 
the series b notes include million of borrowings that incur interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 
the debt agreement contains various covenants limiting williams pipe line company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens other than tax liens  mechanic s and materialman s liens and other liens and encumbrances incurred in the ordinary course of business  make investments  other than investments in the williams pipe line system  cash and short term securities and acquisitions  dispose of assets  engage in any business other than the transportation  storage and distribution of hydrocarbons  create obligations for some lease payments  and engage in transactions with affiliates other than arm s length transactions 
in addition  the debt agreement prohibits us from redeeming the class b units except with proceeds from an equity offering 
it also prohibits our general partner from incurring any indebtedness 
the williams pipe line notes also contain financial covenants  that apply to both williams pipe line and us  to maintain specified ratios of ebitda as defined in the williams pipe line senior secured debt agreement to interest expense of not less than to  and total debt to ebitda of not more than to we are in compliance with all of these covenants 

table of contents in the event of a change in control of the general partner  each holder of the notes would have days within which they could exercise a right to put their notes to williams pipe line unless the new owner of the general partner has i a net worth of at least million and ii long term unsecured debt rated as investment grade by both moody s investor service inc and standard poor s rating service 
a change of control is an event in which williams or its affiliates no longer own or more of the general partner s interest in us 
if this put right were to be exercised  williams pipe line would be obligated to repurchase any such notes at par value and repay any accrued interest within sixty days 
olp term loan and revolving credit facility 
subsequent to the closing of our initial public offering on february   we relied on cash generated from operations as our primary source of funding  except for payout capital expenditures 
additional funding requirements are met by a million credit facility of one of our operating partnerships that expires on february  this credit facility is comprised of a million term loan and an million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is comprised of a million acquisition sub facility and a million working capital sub facility 
indebtedness under this credit facility bears interest at the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
we also incur a commitment fee on the unused portions of the credit facility 
as of december   the million term loan is outstanding with the entire million revolving credit facility available for future borrowings 
obligations under the credit facility are unsecured but are guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of the operating partnership 
indebtedness under the credit facility ranks equally with all the outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated debt of our operating partnership 
williams pipe line is a separate operating subsidiary of ours and is not a borrower or guarantor under this credit facility 
the credit facility contains various operational and financial covenants limiting our operating partnership s ability to incur additional unsecured indebtedness of more than million  subordinated debt owed to affiliates of more than million and secured purchase money debt of more than million  including maintaining the ratios described below  grant liens other than tax liens  mechanic s and materialman s liens and other liens and encumbrances incurred in the ordinary course of the operating partnership s business  make investments  other than investments in the operating partnership s subsidiaries  cash and short term securities and acquisitions  merge or consolidate  sell all of the operating partnership s assets  make distributions other than from available cash  engage in any business other than the transportation  storage and distribution of hydrocarbons and ammonia  create obligations for some lease payments  or engage in transactions with affiliates other than arm s length transactions 
the credit facility also contains covenants requiring the operating partnership to maintain specified ratios of ebitda as defined in the credit facility  pro forma for any asset acquisitions  to interest expense of not less than to  and total debt to ebitda  pro forma for any asset acquisitions  of not more than to we are in compliance with all of these covenants

the following table summarizes the principal payment schedule for each of our borrowings as of december  debt principal payments due by period total years in millions williams pipe line senior secured notes olp term loan and revolving credit facility debt to total capitalization the ratio of debt to total capitalization is a measure frequently used by the financial community to assess the reasonableness of a company s debt levels compared to total capitalization  calculated by adding total debt and total partners capital 
based on the figures shown in our balance sheet  debt to total capitalization is at december  because accounting rules required the acquisition of the williams pipe line system to be recorded at historical book value due to the affiliate nature of the transaction  the million difference between the purchase price and book value at the time of the acquisition was recorded as a decrease to the general partner s capital account  thus lowering our overall partners capital 
if williams pipe line had been purchased from a third party  the asset would have been recorded at market value  resulting in a debt to total capitalization of  which is consistent with management s indicated target level of 
environmental our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  adopted by various governmental authorities  in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted 
we have accrued liabilities for estimated site restoration costs to be incurred in the future at our facilities and properties  including liabilities for environmental remediation obligations at various sites where we have been identified as a possibly responsible party 
under our accounting policies  liabilities are recorded when site restoration and environmental remediation and cleanup obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  and with respect solely to the petroleum products terminals and ammonia pipeline system owned at the time of that offering  an affiliate of williams agreed to indemnify us against environmental liabilities up to million resulting from events that arose prior to february   become known within three years after february  and exceed all amounts recovered or recoverable by us under contractual indemnities from third parties or under any applicable insurance policies 
as of december   we had collected million against williams energy services indemnity and had recorded million of environmental liabilities associated with our petroleum products terminals and ammonia systems  substantially all of which were covered by williams energy services indemnification 
of these environmental liabilities  million is expected to be recovered from williams energy services 
further  we expect to incur million of environmental capital  which could also be covered by this indemnification

in connection with our acquisition of the williams pipe line system on april   williams energy services agreed to indemnify us for losses and damages related to breach of environmental representations and warranties and the failure to comply with environmental laws prior to closing in excess of million up to a maximum of million 
this million will also cover claims made by us for breaches of other williams energy services representations and warranties 
the environmental indemnification obligation applies to liabilities that resulted from conduct prior to the closing of our acquisition of the williams pipe line

williams has provided a performance guarantee for these environmental indemnities 
as of december   we had collected million against this indemnification 
as of december   we had accrued environmental remediation liabilities associated with the williams pipe line system of million 
management estimates that these expenditures will be paid over the next five years 
of these environmental liabilities  million are expected to be recoverable from affiliates 
in addition  we are forecasting capital expenditures associated with environmental projects of million  which are expected to be indemnified but are not included in our affiliate accounts receivable 
impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment and may increase the costs of labor and supplies

critical accounting estimates goodwill impairment in january  we began applying the new rules established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  relative to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard we no longer amortize goodwill because it is an asset with an indefinite useful life but test it for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test is to determine if the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then the goodwill may be impaired 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill should be calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination 
we had recognized million of goodwill on october  and million of goodwill on december  all of the goodwill and other intangibles recognized by us are associated with the petroleum products terminals segment and were acquired as part of the gibson  louisiana and little rock  arkansas terminals acquisitions see note acquisitions and divestitures 
we performed our annual testing of goodwill  as required by sfas no 
as of october  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate of our petroleum products terminals segment because significant judgment is exercised during the process of determining the petroleum products terminals segment fair value and because different assumptions could result in material charges to our operating results 
for the test  fair value of the petroleum products terminals was assessed using three approaches a market value approach  a discounted future cash flows approach and an ebitda multiple approach 
under the market value approach  we calculated the total enterprise value on october  and allocated that total value between our three operating segments based on the relative discounted future cash flows of all three operating segments 
the carrying value of the segment was allocated based on our total partners capital 
under the discounted future cash flows method  the cash flows of the petroleum products terminals segment were estimated using our internal forecasts to project revenues and costs in the short term and assumed incremental revenues and costs for periods beyond based on historical trends 
the discounted future cash flows model assumed a discount rate based on an expected return on equity and a cost of debt and a debt to equity ratio 
under the ebitda multiple approach  we applied a multiple of times the adjusted ebitda of the petroleum products terminals segment to determine fair value 
we define ebitda as income before income taxes plus interest expense net of interest income and depreciation and amortization expense 
ebitda multiples are used industry wide in assessing values for business assets similar 
table of contents to those in our petroleum products terminals segment 
the ebitda of the petroleum products terminals segment was adjusted to exclude a portion of the general and administrative expenses to take into consideration expected synergies 
under each of the three methodologies the fair value of the petroleum products terminals segment exceeded the carrying value of the segment and therefore we did not recognize an impairment in in reaching the conclusion above  more confidence was placed on the ebitda multiple approach because management determined this approach more closely represented the amount at which the petroleum products terminals segment could be sold in a transaction between willing parties 
the critical factor in the ebitda multiple approach is the multiple itself 
when valuing potential acquisitions or assets to be disposed of  we generally use multiples between times ebitda to times ebitda  depending on factors such as the size of the transaction  the prospects for revenue growth or cost reductions  the overall condition of the assets  the age of facility  the location of the facility  the reputation of the seller and the intended use of the facility 
for our goodwill impairment testing on october   we used a multiple of times ebitda to determine the fair value of the petroleum products segment 
if that multiple were reduced to times ebitda  the ebitda multiple approach would have suggested that we would need to recognize an impairment of approximately million 
if the multiple were further decreased to times ebitda  the ebitda multiple approach would have suggested that the full carrying value of goodwill was impaired and we would have been required to recognize an impairment loss of million 
the impact of an impairment under the latter scenario would have increased our leverage ratio beyond the maximum allowed in our olp term loan and revolving credit facility 
under this scenario  the lenders in the olp facility could choose to accelerate the repayment of the loan  which would materially negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows 
in today s markets it is difficult to assess how lenders would react to such a scenario  however  we currently do not believe that  under this latter scenario  the olp lenders would choose this course of action 
based on our test of goodwill as of october   management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill required 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this management discussion and analysis section of our annual report on form k 
asset impairments we evaluate our property  plant and equipment pp e for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value from the reported value of the asset 
we operate in three segments williams pipe line system  petroleum products terminals and the ammonia pipeline system 
we reviewed our ammonia pipeline system for possible impairment as of december   because there are only three customers transporting product on that system and farmland  the largest of the three  filed for protection under the united states bankruptcy codes in may please read farmland discussion under management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other known trends and events 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to an impairment of our ammonia pipeline is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales  in markets which have been highly volatile in certain periods during the last few years  over the remaining depreciable life of the ammonia pipeline system  which includes assets that are depreciated over a period of years  it is susceptible to change because of the assumptions management made relative to the future volume of shipments on our system  and of the impact that recognizing an impairment on the ammonia assets would have on net 
table of contents income 
the ammonia pipeline system accounts for only approximately of our total assets so the impact of a pp e impairment on the balance sheet  while significant  would not be considered material 
management s assumptions about future ammonia shipments and future operating costs require significant judgment because farmland s bankruptcy raises concerns over their ability to continue to ship product on our line and it is difficult to assess the impact that a sale of farmland s facilities to a third party might have on our shipments or the impact that farmland s bankruptcy might have on the two other competing companies on our ammonia pipeline system  the primary feedstock for producing ammonia is natural gas 
as the price of natural gas increases  production costs for anhydrous ammonia also increase 
the impact on our customers is that they generally experience a reduction in the demand for their product and consequently ship fewer tons of ammonia on our pipeline system 
natural gas prices have fluctuated widely over the past several years and have increased to unprecedented high levels during the first quarter of  and possible increases in the operating costs of the pipeline due to the loss of synergies due to williams sale of the mid america pipeline company  a former affiliate whose pipeline ran parallel to our ammonia pipeline system in some areas 
our estimates of future cash flows evaluated four separate scenarios involving the potential impact of farmland s bankruptcy on our operations  along with an estimate of the probability of each scenario occurring 
the estimates cover a range from of farmland s future shipment volumes being lost to all of farmland s future shipment volumes being lost 
we used our internal forecasts to project revenues and costs in the short term and assumed incremental revenues and costs for periods beyond based on historical trends 
probabilities were assigned to each scenario based on management s best estimates applying existing market conditions  historical trends and knowledge of our customers  the anhydrous fertilizer markets and competitors 
the highest probability of occurrence was assigned to the scenario of losing of farmland s volumes and the lowest probability of occurrence was assigned to the scenario of losing all of farmland s volumes 
based on our model  the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  exceeded the reported value and therefore we did not recognize an impairment in as of december   our investment in the ammonia pipeline system s pp e was million 
any increase in the estimated future cash flows would have no impact on our recorded value of the ammonia pipeline system 
however  if we were to assign a probability to the scenario that all of farmland s volumes are lost  probability that of farmland s volumes are lost and a probability that of farmland s volumes would be lost  we would have been required to recognize an impairment loss of approximately million 
average tons shipped under this scenario would be thousand tons per year over most of the year period evaluated  which management views as unlikely 
if we further changed our assumptions such that the increase in ammonia revenues beyond our short term plan assumptions were reduced from growth to growth per year  that impairment loss would increase to million 
the impact of such an impairment would have increased our leverage ratio beyond the maximum allowed in our term loan and revolving credit facility which would materially negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows 
in this scenario  the lenders in the olp facility could choose to accelerate the repayment of the loan 
in today s markets it is difficult to assess how lenders would react to such a scenario  however  management currently does not believe that  under this scenario  the lenders in the olp facility would take this course of action 
based on our assessment of the ammonia pipeline system at december   management concluded that an impairment of the system was not required 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
environmental liabilities we estimate the liabilities associated with environmental expenditures based on site specific project plans for remediation  taking into account prior remediation experience 
experienced remediation project managers evaluate each known case of environmental liability to determine what phases and associated costs can be reasonably estimated and to ensure compliance with all applicable federal and or state requirements 
we 
table of contents believe the accounting estimate relative to environmental remediation costs to be a critical accounting estimate because estimated expenditures  which will generally be made over the next to years  are subject to price fluctuations and could change materially  unanticipated third party liabilities may arise  and or changes in federal  state and local environmental regulations could also significantly increase the amount of the liability 
the estimate for environmental liabilities is a critical accounting estimate for all three of our operating segments 
a defined process for project reviews is integrated into our system integrity plan 
specifically  our remediation project managers meet once a year with accounting  operations  legal and other personnel to evaluate  in detail  the known environmental liabilities associated with each of our operating units 
the purpose of the annual project review is to assess all aspects of each project  evaluating what will be required to achieve regulatory compliance  estimating the costs associated with executing the regulatory phases that can be reasonably estimated and estimating the timing for those expenditures 
during the site specific evaluations  all known information is utilized in conjunction with professional judgment and experience to determine the appropriate path forward and assess liabilities 
the general remediation process to achieve regulatory compliance is site investigation delineation  site remediation  and long term monitoring 
each of these phases can  and often do  include unknown variables which complicate the task of evaluating the estimated costs to complete 
during  the recommendations that came from the annual review process resulted in our increasing our environmental liabilities by million  which was largely attributable to our quantifying the liability remediation and long term monitoring at six state mandated sites 
based on known liabilities  this large accrual adjustment is not anticipated to be a recurring event 
each quarter  we reevaluate our environmental estimates taking into account any new incidents that have occurred since the last annual meeting of the remediation project managers  any changes in the site situation and additional findings and or changes in federal or state regulations 
the estimated environmental liability accruals are adjusted as necessary 
assuming a increase in our estimated environmental liabilities and further assuming that of those additional liabilities would be indemnified by williams  our expenses would increase by million and operating profit and net income would decrease by million  which represented of both our operating profit and net income for such a change would result in less than a increase in our total liabilities and decrease our equity by less than 
the impact of such an increase in environmental costs would likely not have affected our liquidity and capital resources because  even with the increased costs  we would still be within the covenants of our long term debt agreements as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources liquidity and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact on our results is critically dependent on our reliance on williams performance related to these indemnities see discussion of affiliate receivables below 
our management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our general partner s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
affiliate receivables we have agreements with williams related to the assets acquired at the time of our initial public offering in february and to the williams pipe line system acquired in april these agreements indemnify us against environmental losses up to million relating to the assets our affiliates contributed to us at the time of our initial public offering 
in connection with the acquisition of the williams pipe line system  williams agreed to indemnify us for environmental losses up to million  after a million deductible 
beyond the million indemnity  williams is responsible for one half of all environmental losses up to million  for a total indemnity of million 
when a site specific environmental liability is recognized  a determination is made as to whether or not the liability is indemnified by williams 
if so  an affiliate receivable for the amount of the indemnified liability is also recognized 
we do not require payment from williams until actual remediation work is performed on the site 
at that time  williams is billed for the remediation work and the cash received is used to reduce the affiliate environmental receivable 
as of 
table of contents december   we had recognized affiliate receivables of million  of which million were associated with environmental indemnities 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to affiliate receivables is a critical accounting estimate because its carrying amount is subject to all of the same estimates as those used to develop the underlying environmental liabilities see critical accounting estimates environmental liabilities above  and given williams current financial status it requires our management s estimations involving our ability to collect the receivable amount from williams 
in preparing our financial statements for the year ended december   management s assumptions were that we would be able to collect the full amount of these receivables from williams 
should williams be unable to perform on its existing debt obligations  we may be unable to collect part  or all  of our affiliate accounts receivable 
if we change our estimate of the amount of the affiliate receivable we believe we can ultimately collect from williams  we would be required to take a charge against income because we have not recorded any allowance for doubtful accounts associated with this receivable 
assuming that none of the receivable is collectable would require a charge against income of million  which represents of our net income for the year 
the impact of such an impairment would have increased our leverage ratio beyond the maximum allowed in our credit facility which would materially negatively impact our liquidity and cash flows 
in this scenario  the lenders in the olp facility could choose to accelerate the repayment of the loan 
in today s markets it is difficult to assess how lenders would react to such a scenario  however  management currently does not believe that  even under this scenario  the lenders in the olp facility would take that course of action

related party transactions we have entered into a number of commercial agreements with affiliates  including williams energy marketing trading  williams midstream marketing risk management  williams refining marketing  williams ethanol services  inc and mid america pipeline company 
each of these entities was a subsidiary of williams and an affiliate of ours and of our general partner during the periods presented 
the principal business of williams energy marketing trading is the marketing and trading of energy commodities including natural gas  natural gas liquids  power  crude oil and refined petroleum products 
williams refining marketing primarily owned and operated a refinery in memphis  tennessee and engaged in the purchase and sale of crude and refined petroleum products please read petroleum products terminals inland terminals for a discussion of the sale of the williams refining marketing s refinery in memphis  tennessee 
williams midstream marketing risk management manages sales  marketing and risk management for williams midstream business 
williams ethanol services operates two ethanol plants and an 
table of contents ethanol distribution system and also engages in the purchase and sale of ethanol 
mid america pipeline is an interstate common carrier pipeline company engaged in the transportation and distribution of natural gas liquids 
williams sold mid america pipeline in august during williams refining marketing sold its refinery in memphis  tennessee and its travel center operations 
also  williams has announced that it has an agreement to sell williams ethanol services  which it expects to complete in the agreements with our affiliates vary depending upon location and the types of services provided 
approximately million and million of our revenues in and  respectively  were generated from agreements with affiliates at our petroleum products terminals while approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively  was generated from agreements with affiliates on the williams pipe line system 
in addition  approximately million and million of expenses were incurred in and  respectively  from product purchases with our affiliates on the williams pipe line system 
a summary of the significant agreements follows the williams pipe line system tariff based shipments 
williams energy marketing trading  williams refining marketing and williams midstream marketing risk management ship refined petroleum products on our pipeline system 
we charge rates for the shipments based upon tariffs filed with the ferc or the applicable state agency that are the same rates we charge to non affiliated entities 
these tariffs serve as individual contractual agreements that commit our affiliate to pay for volume transported on our system as long as we abide by the terms of the tariff 
as a result  contracts generally do not exist that obligate our affiliates to ship volume or make payments to us in the future 
the principal exceptions to this are i our throughput and deficiency agreement with williams energy marketing and trading for product movements through a third party capacity lease and ii for propane movements from el dorado  kansas to carthage  missouri 
the throughput and deficiency agreement for the propane movements from el dorado  kansas to carthage  missouri expires on march  the total revenues associated with tariff based shipments were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
system lease storage agreements 
we have entered into several agreements with williams energy marketing trading and williams refining marketing for the access and utilization of storage along the williams pipe line system 
we also have an agreement with williams energy marketing trading  which expires on march   for the lease of our carthage  missouri cavern 
these agreements provide for a fixed monthly storage capacity on the pipeline system at a fixed rate 
the rates charged to our affiliates are consistent with those charged to non affiliated entities 
services provided under these agreements include the receipt of refined petroleum products into our system at any origin point on our system 
our affiliates remain responsible for tariff charges related to the actual shipment of product and delivery through our terminals 
these contracts have one year terms and  as they expire  are usually renewed for a one year term 
these agreements generated approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
ethanol storage and throughput agreements 
we have entered into several agreements with williams ethanol services for the access and utilization of storage along the williams pipe line system 
these agreements provide for a fixed monthly ethanol storage capacity at our terminals at a fixed storage rate 
the rates charged to our affiliates are consistent with those charged to non affiliated entities 
in addition  we charge additional fees ranging from per barrel to over per barrel for blending services and handling fees at certain terminals 
a majority of these contracts have a term ranging from less than one year and up to two years 
these agreements generated approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
facility rental agreement 
we have entered into an agreement to lease to mid america pipeline approximately miles of pipeline  three active pump stations and a propane storage and loading facility in canton  south dakota 
mid america pipeline is responsible for utilities and other operating costs 
the agreement  entered into in  was renewed yearly until the rate charged for this lease has not changed from year to year 
this agreement generated approximately million of revenue in and approximately million of revenue in during that portion of the year that mid america pipeline was 
table of contents still an affiliate of ours 
in july  mid america pipeline was sold by williams  consequently  any revenues associated with this agreement since that time has been classified as third party revenues 
system services agreements 
we have entered into agreements with williams energy marketing trading  williams refining marketing and williams ethanol services providing them with a non exclusive and non transferable sublicense to use the atlas software system 
the system can be utilized to access data for monitoring shipment and inventory status and performing other functions related to shipment activities 
the agreements establish fixed rates at which we provide certain services 
these agreements generated approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
over and short settlement and product purchases and sales agreements 
during part of  we had agreements with williams energy marketing trading and williams midstream marketing risk management to buy natural gas liquids blendstocks and sell the refined petroleum products related to our blending program 
we also had agreements with williams energy marketing trading to purchase from or sell to us refined petroleum products needed to maintain inventory balances on our pipeline system which we refer to as over and short settlements 
these transactions were subject to master purchase and sale agreements for refined petroleum products or a master purchase agreement for natural gas liquids 
each transaction with our affiliate was recorded on a confirmation statement  which was subject to the general terms outlined in the master agreements 
these confirmation statements determined the volume  price and timing associated with the product purchases and sales 
the revenue associated with these agreements was approximately million and million in and  respectively  while the expenses incurred to purchase products from our affiliates were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
additional details related to the activities that produce the purchase and sale opportunities are as follows blending 
historically  williams pipe line company purchased natural gas liquids from williams energy marketing trading at cost plus a fixed fee of per barrel 
williams energy marketing trading purchased at prevailing market prices a majority of the finished gasoline that was produced from blending 
in connection with the acquisition of the williams pipe line system in april  we and williams energy services agreed that the williams pipe line system would no longer take title to the natural gas liquids it blends or the resulting product 
we now perform these blending services for williams energy services under a separate agreement see below 
over and short settlement 
generally  the physical volumes on our system will not match the balances recorded by our customers 
these differences are either product quality differences or absolute volume differences 
quality differences usually result from the commingling of product on the pipeline during times when we change the product being shipped on our pipeline 
when these differences occur  we purchase and sell product at prevailing market prices to manage the imbalances 
butane blending agreement 
we perform blending services on the williams pipe line system for williams energy services under a ten year agreement which provides for an annual fee of approximately million  of which million is attributable to blending services provided at one of our inland petroleum products terminals not connected to the williams pipe line system 
we do not take title to any of the product used in or resulting from the blending process 
this agreement  entered into at the time of our acquisition of williams pipe line in april  generated approximately million in  of which million was for services performed on the williams pipe line system and million was for services performed at one of our inland petroleum products terminals 
longhorn partners pipeline construction revenue agreement 
prior to its acquisition by us in april of  williams pipe line company had agreements with longhorn partners pipeline to provide engineering  design  construction  start up and pipeline operating services 
under these agreements  williams pipe line company was reimbursed for costs incurred and received contractor and operating fees 
the revenue associated with these agreements was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in connection with our acquisition of williams pipe line company  these agreements were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary of williams and consequently we no longer provide these services and receive these fees 

table of contents natural gas and fuel oil supply agreements 
during part of  we had agreements with williams energy marketing trading and williams refining marketing for the supply of natural gas and fuel oil used at pump stations throughout the williams pipe line system 
we purchased fuel oil from williams refining marketing at the prevailing market price 
these purchases were identified on confirmation statements that were subject to the master refined products purchase and sale agreements used in the blending and over and short program 
we purchased natural gas from williams energy marketing trading either based on indexed prices or at fixed prices 
in  we elected to purchase a majority of our natural gas at fixed prices  which required that we commit to a definite volume of natural gas purchases 
the natural gas purchase agreement for fixed price natural gas expired in august these agreements generated operating expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
petroleum products terminals inland terminal use and access agreements 
we have entered into several agreements with williams refining marketing for the access and utilization of our inland terminals 
the services provided under these agreements include the receipt and delivery of refined petroleum products via connecting common carrier pipelines 
additional services include product handling  storage  inventory management  and additive injection 
these agreements establish a market based fee at which these services are provided at rates consistent with those charged to non affiliated entities 
a majority of these contracts have a term of one year and are renewed on an annual basis 
the revenue associated with these agreements was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the sale of williams refining marketing s refinery in memphis  tennessee and their travel center operations during the first quarter of  will result in significantly lower revenues from williams refining marketing during products terminals and storage agreement for the galena park  texas marine terminal facility 
we entered into an agreement with williams energy marketing trading to provide approximately million barrels of storage capacity and to provide other ancillary services at our galena park  texas marine terminal facility 
because the storage fees are fixed and the storage capacity is already committed  revenues fluctuate to the extent other ancillary services are utilized and or a tank is out of service as part of our system integrity program 
the primary services provided include receipt and delivery of refined petroleum products and blendstocks via marine vessel  pipeline  tank truck or other transfers from customers within the terminal facility 
the prices charged under this agreement are consistent with those charged to non affiliated entities 
the agreement  which generated approximately million and million of revenue in and  respectively  expires on september  we have negotiated the termination of this agreement with williams energy marketing trading  effective in march we expect to receive cash of approximately million from williams energy marketing trading to terminate this agreement 
products terminalling agreement for the gibson  louisiana marine terminal facility 
we entered into an agreement to provide williams energy marketing trading capacity utilization rights to substantially all of the capacity of the gibson  louisiana facility for nine years starting november  this agreement allows for the delivery of crude oil and condensate to our facility by barge  truck and pipeline where we then provide storage  blending and throughput services 
williams energy marketing trading has committed to utilize substantially all of the capacity at our facility at a fixed rate which is consistent with rates charged by other service providers for similar services at other locations 
as a result  the revenues we receive should not significantly vary as long as the services we provide do not fall below certain performance standards 
this contract generated approximately million of revenue in and approximately million of revenue for the two months we owned the facility in other affiliate agreements in addition to the expenses incurred under the commercial agreements with our affiliates discussed above  we also incur affiliate expenses for general and administrative  operating and maintenance services under the terms of our partnership agreement and our omnibus agreement  which governs the relationship between us  our general partner and williams 

table of contents risks related to our business we may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to allow us to pay the minimum quarterly distribution following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the cash we generate from our operations 
because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  we may not be able to pay the minimum quarterly distribution for each quarter 
our ability to pay the minimum quarterly distribution each quarter depends primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net income 
potential future acquisitions and expansions  if any  may affect our business by substantially increasing the level of our indebtedness and contingent liabilities and increasing our risk of being unable to effectively integrate these new operations 
from time to time  we evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and businesses 
acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness 
if we consummate any future acquisitions  our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly  and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
acquisitions and business expansions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with new assets and the businesses associated with them and new geographic areas and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions 
our financial results depend on the demand for the refined petroleum products that we transport  store and distribute 
any sustained decrease in demand for refined petroleum products in the markets served by our pipeline and terminals could result in a significant reduction in the volume of products that we transport in our pipeline  store at our marine terminal facilities and distribute through our inland terminals  and thereby reduce our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions 
factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand include an increase in the market price of crude oil that leads to higher refined product prices  which may reduce demand for gasoline and other petroleum products 
market prices for refined petroleum products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in global and regional supply over which we have no control  a recession or other adverse economic condition that results in lower spending by consumers and businesses on transportation fuels such as gasoline  jet fuel and diesel  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase the cost of gasoline  an increase in fuel economy  whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient vehicles or technological advances by manufacturers  and the increased use of alternative fuel sources  such as fuel cells and solar  electric and battery powered engines 
several state and federal initiatives mandate this increased use 

table of contents when prices for the future delivery of petroleum products that we transport through our pipeline system or store in our marine terminals fall below current prices  customers are less likely to store these products  thereby reducing our storage revenues 
this market condition is commonly referred to as backwardation 
when the petroleum product market is in backwardation  the demand for storage capacity at our facilities may decrease 
if the market becomes strongly backwardated for an extended period of time  it may affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
we depend on petroleum products pipelines owned and operated by others to supply our terminals 
most of our inland and marine terminal facilities depend on connections with petroleum product pipelines owned and operated by third parties 
reduced throughput on these pipelines because of testing  line repair  damage to pipelines  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in our being unable to deliver products to our customers from our terminals or receive products for storage and could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
collectively  our affiliates williams energy marketing trading and williams refining marketing have historically been our largest customer  and any reduction in their use of our services could reduce the amount of cash we generate 
for the year ended december  and  our affiliates williams energy marketing trading and williams refining marketing collectively accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
williams has begun the process of reducing its marketing and trading activities 
as a result  we have experienced a reduction of revenues related to their activities 
we are currently in the process of replacing this affiliate revenue with third party revenue 
if we are unable to do so  it could impact our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
since the september attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically our nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be the future target of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any future terrorist attack on our facilities  those of our customers and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the transportation of refined petroleum products and ammonia  including ruptures  leaks and fires 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
in addition  as a result of market conditions  premiums for our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further 
in some instances  insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers are now requiring broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist and sabotage acts 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
rate regulation or a successful challenge to the rates we charge on the williams pipe line system may reduce the amount of cash we generate 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or the ferc  regulates the tariff rates for the williams pipe line system 
shippers may protest the pipeline system s tariffs  and the ferc may investigate the 
table of contents lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates and order refunds of amounts collected under rates ultimately found to be unlawful 
the ferc may also investigate tariff rates that have become final and effective 
the ferc s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our true costs or may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs 
the ferc s primary ratemaking methodology is price indexing 
we use this methodology to establish our rates in approximately one third of our interstate markets 
the indexing method allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage equal to the change in the producer price index  or ppi 
please read narrative description of business tariff regulation for further discussion of tariff rates and how they have been impacted by the ppi 
if the ppi rises by less than or falls  we could be required to reduce our rates that are based on the ferc s price indexing methodology if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate 
in addition  changes in the ppi might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in the costs associated with the pipeline 
in recent decisions involving unrelated pipeline limited partnerships  the ferc has ruled that these partnerships may not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate limited partners 
a shipper could rely on these decisions to challenge our indexed rates and claim that  because we now own the williams pipe line system  the williams pipe line system s income tax allowance should be reduced 
if the ferc were to disallow all or part of our income tax allowance  it may be more difficult to justify our rates 
if a challenge were brought and the ferc found that some of the indexed rates exceed levels justified by the cost of service  the ferc would order a reduction in the indexed rates and could require reparations for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
any reduction in the indexed rates or payment of reparations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
mergers among our customers and competitors could result in lower volumes being shipped on our pipelines and or products stored in our terminals  thereby reducing the amount of cash we generate 
mergers between existing customers could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete 
as a result  we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues 
because most of our operating costs are fixed  a reduction in volumes would result not only in a reduction of revenues  but also a decline in net income and cash flow of a similar magnitude  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
the closure of mid continent refineries that supply the williams pipe line system could result in disruptions or reductions in the volumes transported on the williams pipe line system and the amount of cash we generate 
the us environmental protection agency recently adopted requirements that require refineries to install equipment to lower the sulfur content of gasoline and some diesel fuel they produce 
the requirements relating to gasoline will take effect and be implemented in  and the requirements relating to diesel fuel will take effect in and be implemented through if refinery owners that use the williams pipe line system determine that compliance with these new requirements is too costly  they may close some of these refineries  which could reduce the volumes transported on the williams pipe line system and the amount of cash we generate 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations that govern the environmental and operational safety aspects of its operations 
each of our operating segments are subject to the risk of incurring substantial costs and liabilities under environmental and safety laws 
these costs and liabilities arise under increasingly strict environmental and safety laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies  and as a result of claims for damages to property or persons arising from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
if we 
table of contents were unable to recover these costs through increased revenues  our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions could be adversely affected 
the terminal and pipeline facilities that comprise the williams pipe line system have been used for many years to transport  distribute or store petroleum products 
over time  operations by us  our predecessors or third parties may have resulted in the disposal or release of hydrocarbons or solid wastes at or from these terminal properties and along such pipeline rights of way 
in addition  some of our terminals and pipelines are located on or near current or former refining and terminal sites  and there is a risk that contamination is present on those sites 
we may be held jointly and severally liable under a number of these environmental laws and regulations for such disposal and releases of hydrocarbons or solid wastes or the existence of contamination  even in circumstances where such activities or conditions were caused by third parties not under our control or were otherwise lawful at the time that they occurred 
in addition  we own a number of properties that have been used for many years to distribute or store petroleum products by third parties not under our control 
in some cases  owners  tenants or users of these properties have disposed of or released hydrocarbons or solid wastes on or under these properties 
in addition  some of our terminals are located on or near current or former refining and terminal operations  and there is a risk that contamination is present on these sites 
the transportation of ammonia by our pipeline is hazardous and may result in environmental damage  including accidental releases that may cause death or injuries to humans and farm animals and damage to crops 
competition with respect to our operating segments could ultimately lead to lower levels of profits and reduce the amount of cash we generate 
we face competition from other pipelines and terminals in the same markets as the williams pipe line system  as well as from other means of transporting  storing and distributing petroleum products 
for a description of the competitive factors facing the williams pipe line system  please read business williams pipe line system competition 
in addition  our marine and inland terminals face competition from large  generally well financed companies that own many terminals  as well as from small companies 
our marine and inland terminals also encounter competition from integrated refining and marketing companies that own their own terminal facilities 
our customers demand delivery of products on tight time schedules and in a number of geographic markets 
if our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers  they may use our competitors 
we compete primarily with rail carriers for the transportation of ammonia 
if our customers elect to transport ammonia by rail rather than pipeline  we may realize lower revenues and cash flows and our ability to pay cash distributions may be adversely affected 
our ammonia pipeline also competes with another ammonia pipeline in iowa and nebraska 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would reduce the amount of cash we generate 
the after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
if we were classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate rate 
some or all of the distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend incomes  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to unitholders 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow  which would reduce our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation would materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available to pay distributions would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that  if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for 
table of contents federal  state or local income tax purposes  then the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be decreased to reflect that impact on us 
our ammonia pipeline system is dependent on three customers 
three customers ship all of the ammonia on our pipeline and utilize the six terminals that we own and operate on the pipeline 
we have contracts with farmland industries  inc  agrium us inc 
and terra nitrogen  us through june that obligate them to ship or pay for specified minimum quantities of ammonia 
farmland industries  inc  the largest of our three customers  filed for bankruptcy protection in may  has exercised its right to terminate its contract with us effective december  please read business ammonia pipeline system farmland and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions of farmland 
another of these customers has a credit rating below investment grade 
the loss of any one of these three customers or their failure or inability to pay us could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
high natural gas prices can increase ammonia production costs and reduce the amount of ammonia transported through our ammonia pipeline system 
the profitability of our customers that produce ammonia partially depends on the price of natural gas  which is the principal raw material used in the production of ammonia 
natural gas prices increased late in the fourth quarter of and have reached unprecedented levels in the first quarter of an extended period of high natural gas prices may cause our customers to produce and ship lower volumes of ammonia  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay cash distributions 
williams has announced its intention to divest its interest in our general partner 
a sale of our general partner could result in the acceleration of payment of our debt obligations 
in addition  it could result in the termination of our omnibus agreement with williams and our general partner or the termination of williams obligation to provide general and administrative services for a fixed charge  which could result in higher general and administrative expenses  increased maintenance capital expenditures and increased environmental expenditures  which could limit our ability to pay cash distributions 
on february   williams announced its intention to divest its interest in our general partner and its common  class b and subordinated units 
a sale of the general partner could result in the holders of our debt obligations accelerating the payments due to them under those agreements 
also  a change of control in the general partner may result in the termination of the general and administrative expense limitation under the omnibus agreement  which could result in higher general and administrative costs to us 
the termination of the omnibus agreement could also terminate the agreements we have with williams to reimburse us for maintenance capital costs associated with williams pipe line maintenance capital over the next two years  which could increase our maintenance capital costs which  in turn  could limit our ability to pay cash distributions 
also  the environmental indemnities associated with the assets acquired at the time of our initial public offering could be terminated 
williams provides a variety of services for us 
a sale of williams interests in our general partner would require us to separate from williams  which in turn  would require us to obtain these services from independent sources  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to pay cash distributions 
williams provides a number of services to us that are billed to the partnership as general and administrative expense 
these costs include accounting  building administration  human resources  information technology  legal and security  among others 
in addition  williams provides us several key software applications critical to our business including our general ledger  scada and accounts payable systems  as well as our desktop and networking systems 
separating ourselves from williams will entail acquiring similar services and systems  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to pay cash distributions 

table of contents our relationship with williams subjects us to potential risks that are beyond our control 
due to our relationship with williams  adverse developments or announcements concerning williams  including bankruptcy proceedings  could adversely affect our financial condition  even if we have not suffered any similar development 
in addition  further downgrades by one or more credit rating agencies of the outstanding indebtedness of williams could increase our borrowing costs or generally impede our access to capital markets 
we also have significant right of way and environmental indemnities from williams 
further adverse developments could result in williams being unable to perform on its existing obligations  including their right of way and environmental indemnities with us  which could adversely affect our ability to finance acquisitions  refinance existing indebtedness and pay cash distributions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not engage in interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
debt we incur under our credit facility and our floating rate series a senior secured notes bear variable interest based on the eurodollar rate 
if the libor changed by  our annual interest obligations associated with the million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility at december   and the million of outstanding borrowings under the floating rate series a senior secured notes would change by approximately million 
unless interest rates change significantly in the future  our exposure to interest rate market risk is minimal
