item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
these forward looking statements fall within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  can  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition and elsewhere in this report 
overview maxygen was founded in may and began operations in march to date  we have generated revenues from research collaborations with agriculture  pharmaceutical  petroleum  and chemical companies and from government grants 
we have strategic collaborations with leading companies including aventis pasteur in novel vaccines  intermune in next generation interferon gamma therapies  lundbeck in interferon beta therapies for nervous system diseases  including multiple sclerosis  alk abell in allergy  the international aids vaccine initiative iavi in hiv  eli lilly  pfizer and dsm in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and shearwater corporation a subsidiary of nektar therapeutics for protein pharmaceutical pegylation technologies 
additionally  we have a range of other strategic alliances in industrial applications  as well as funding from us government organizations including from the defense advanced research projects agency  the national institute of standards and technology advanced technology program  the us agency for international development and the us army medical research and materiel command 
revenue from strategic alliances and government grants increased from million in to million in to million in revenues may fluctuate from period to period because there can be no assurance that these collaborations will continue for their initial term or beyond 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
these investments have contributed to the increases in our research and development expenses from million in to million in to million in our total headcount increased from employees at the end of to at the end of as of december  we had employees  of whom approximately were engaged in research and development 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
on august   we completed our acquisition of maxygen aps  a danish biotechnology company located in copenhagen  denmark 
maxygen aps is focused on the development of improved second generation protein pharmaceutical products and has developed broad pre clinical development capabilities and proprietary technologies and expertise that help to address traditional shortcomings of protein pharmaceuticals such as half life  stability and immunogenicity 
the transaction was recorded under the purchase method of accounting 
we issued  shares of our common stock and granted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition of all the equity securities of maxygen aps 
of the  shares of common stock issued   shares were issued with repurchase rights that lapse over a three year term 
the consideration  including liabilities assumed of million and estimated acquisition costs of million  aggregated million  of which million was allocated to tangible assets  million to acquired in process research and development  million to deferred compensation  million to core technology   to assembled workforce and million to goodwill 
the results of operations of maxygen aps are included in our operating results after august  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the amounts of maxygen and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark  which was acquired by the company in august  maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands and verdia  inc  as well as our majority owned subsidiary  codexis  inc 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
our ownership in codexis is approximately  based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of codexis common and preferred stock 
in accordance with eitf consensus  investor accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority stockholder or stockholders have certain approval or veto rights and paragraph of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  we have included of the net losses of codexis in the determination of our consolidated net loss 
we record minority interest in the consolidated financial statements to account for the ownership interest of the minority owner 
our investment in the joint venture with delta pine and land company called deltamax cotton llc in which we have an equity interest of is being accounted for under the equity method 
goodwill and intangible impairment in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective january   we amortized this goodwill and other intangible assets using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives of three years  the term of expected benefit to maxygen 
we believed this term was reasonable given that maxygen aps was a development stage entity and its technology was at an early stage of development and was yet unproven 
pursuant to our adoption of sfas effective january   we have ceased amortizing goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
in accordance with sfas  if certain indicators of impairment exist  we will review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or in the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance 
table of contents with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in the underlying business and products of our reporting units  or other factors specific to each asset or reporting unit being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our existing corporate collaboration agreements generally provide for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  these collaborators may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
such payments are recognized ratably over the applicable funding period 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we have deferred revenues of approximately million that we expect to recognize over the next three years 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to maxygen  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license  research  technology advancement and milestone payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements  government research grants  and royalties from our collaborators based upon revenues received from any products commercialized under those agreements

deferred compensation deferred compensation for options granted to employees has been determined as the difference between the deemed fair market value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date the applicable options were granted and the exercise price 
deferred compensation for options granted to consultants has been 
table of contents determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation for related options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and million in these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
we recognized stock compensation expense related to the deferred compensation amortization on these option grants  which are split between research and development expense and general and administrative expense  as shown in the following table in thousands research and development general and administrative in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of million in   in and  in  which were included in research and development expense  and  in  and  in and  which were included in general and administrative expense 
due to the acceleration of executive stock option awards  an additional million was recorded in as stock compensation expense included in research and development expense 
stock compensation expense relating to the acceleration of options was not material in and in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august  stock options were granted in exchange for outstanding warrants to purchase maxygen aps securities 
in connection with this exchange we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling million 
this amount is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options  of which  was expensed in   in and  in for the shares exchanged that had a right of repurchase  deferred compensation of million was recorded 
this amount is being amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
a total of million was recognized as expense in  million in and million in results of operations revenues our total revenues increased from million in to million in and were million in the increase in collaborative research and development revenue was due to additional strategic alliances and the expansion of existing alliances 
the decline in grant revenue reflects the expiration of four us government grants from the defense advanced research projects agency that began in and in  we expect our consolidated revenue to be in the range of to million consisting of collaboration revenue  grant revenue and royalties on product sales 
this assumes the establishment of new collaborations and that the funded research terms of our collaborations with intermune and lundbeck will begin to wind down as scheduled 
revenues for each operating segment are derived from our research collaboration agreements and government research grants and are categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals agriculture total revenue 
table of contents the increase in revenue for each segment was due to additional strategic alliances and the expansion of existing alliances 
for human therapeutics and chemicals  these increases are partially offset by the decline in government research grant revenue 
research and development expenses we have entered into a number of research and development collaborations to perform research for our collaborators 
the major collaborative agreements have similar contractual terms 
the agreements generally require us to devote a specified number of full time equivalent employees to the research efforts over defined terms generally ranging from three to five years 
the table below lists our major collaborative partners  defined as those contributing greater than of total collaborative research revenue in for whom we conducted research and development  together with the date upon which the funded research term of the contract is scheduled to end 
contracts may only be extended by mutual agreement between maxygen and the collaborative partner 
collaborator funded research ends lundbeck a s september  pioneer hi bred international  inc december  intermune  inc september  we do not generally track fully burdened research and development costs or capital expenditures by project 
however  we estimate  based on full time equivalent effort  that the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred undertaken for collaborative projects funded by our collaborators and government grants was approximately in  in and in the percentage of research effort as measured by hours incurred undertaken for our own internally funded research projects was approximately in  in and in due to the nature of our research and our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize the results of the research  we cannot predict with any certainty whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product and therefore whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our various collaborations 
most of our human therapeutic  agriculture and chemical product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
human therapeutic product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
chemical and agricultural product candidates may be found ineffective  may cause undesirable side effects or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report titled risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs  research consultants and external collaborative research expenses  supplies and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses increased from million in to 
table of contents million in and to million in the increase is primarily due to our accelerated efforts in all aspects of research and development  including increased expenditures resulting from our acquisition of maxygen aps in august  as well as investments in our technology platform and in the development of product candidates 
stock compensation expense related to research and development was million in  million in and million in the decrease in stock compensation expenses was primarily the result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for the shares subject to repurchase that were exchanged in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition in august this deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
the deferred compensation is expected to be fully amortized to expense by september research and development expenses  excluding stock compensation expense  represented of total revenues in  in  and in the increase from to was primarily due to increased staff necessary to manage and support our growth plus increased research and development costs resulting from our acquisition of maxygen aps and new collaboration agreements 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the growth in our total revenues 
we expect research and development cost to increase during as we increase our efforts on internally funded projects 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our products into clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our products prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our products against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses have increased from million in to million in and slightly decreased to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was the result of increased costs of directors and officers liability insurance  increased professional fees and additions to finance staff 
the slight decrease from to was primarily due to receipt of expense reimbursement from litigation with enchira biotechnology received in  partially offset by increased costs of directors and officers liability insurance and increased professional fees 
general and administrative stock compensation expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in stock compensation expense was primarily a result of lower amortization expense related to deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees before our initial public offering 
this deferred compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
the deferred compensation is expected to be fully amortized to expense by the end of general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues for  of total revenues for and of total revenues in the decrease between periods was due primarily to the growth in our total revenue between periods 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase modestly in absolute dollar amounts for at least the next several years as a result of increased professional fees and insurance premiums 
in process research and development on may   we acquired certain in process technology through the acquisition of a privately held california corporation 
in connection with the acquisition we issued  shares of our common stock 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement   shares of our common stock are being held in escrow until such time contingencies regarding the patents related to the acquired technology are resolved 
accordingly  we recorded a charge for acquired in process research and development of  representing the fair value of the  shares delivered to the sellers at closing  plus certain transaction expenses 
shares in escrow will be valued and accounted for when  and if  the contingencies are resolved and the shares are delivered to the sellers 
on august   we acquired maxygen aps for total consideration of approximately million  including million for the assumption of liabilities and million for estimated acquisition costs 
prior to the acquisition  maxygen aps was a danish privately held  development stage company that had minimal revenues since its inception in april maxygen aps is focused on the development of improved second generation protein pharmaceutical products and has developed broad pre clinical development capabilities and proprietary technologies and expertise that help to address traditional shortcomings of protein pharmaceuticals such as half life  stability and immunogenicity 
approximately million of the total purchase price represented the value of in process research and development projects that were at a pre clinical stage of development  had not yet reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative future use 
this amount was charged to our operations in the third quarter ended september  the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of maxygen aps are included in the consolidated financial statements from august  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the million in process research and development charge represents the value determined by an independent appraiser  using a discounted cash flow methodology  attributable to the six pre clinical stage in process research and development projects of maxygen aps that were in progress at the time of acquisition based on a valuation analysis of such research and development 
in process technology was expensed upon acquisition as technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
to value the in process technology we considered  among other factors  the stage of development of each project  the time and resources needed to complete each project  expected income and associated risks 
associated risks included the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project  in obtaining regulatory approval to market  and the risks related to the viability of and potential changes to future target markets 
the charge relates to specific on going research and development 
management of maxygen believes that the allocation of the purchase price to in process research and development was appropriate given the future potential of this research and development to contribute to the operations of maxygen 
assuming this research continues through all stages of clinical development  we project substantial future research and development expenditures related to this technology 
we continue to fund and develop the in process research and development projects acquired through maxygen aps 
there can be no assurances that the in process projects acquired will achieve technological feasibility or that we will be able to successfully market products based on such technology 
should these in process projects fail  the value of our investment in these incomplete technologies would be insignificant or zero 
a failure to successfully develop and market these products could result in an impairment charge to goodwill 
as opportunities present themselves  we intend to continue to acquire new technologies and companies 
such acquisitions could lead to additional direct and indirect expenses that could negatively affect our results of operations 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas in january  we stopped amortizing goodwill and assembled workforce 
we will continue to amortize the purchased core technology over its three year useful life 
such amortization will be fully allocated to expense by september amortization expense of million in  million in and million in was recorded 

table of contents net interest and other income net interest income represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities net of interest expense 
net interest and other income decreased from million in to million in to million in the decreases were due to declining interest rates and lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
equity in net loss of joint venture equity in net loss of joint venture reflects maxygen s share of the net loss of its joint venture  deltamax cotton llc  formed in may  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
equity in net losses of the joint venture was million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses in  and  and consequently did not pay any us federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire in the years through utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in january  we adopted statement of financing accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if indicators of impairment exist  we will review our long lived assets for impairment based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards referred to as sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue referred to as eitf no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as required under eitf the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
the interpretation requires that a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of guarantee obligations issued after december  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for years ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements under this statement 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  receiving aggregate consideration from such sales totaling million and research and development funding from collaborators and government grants totaling approximately million 
in addition  our majority owned subsidiary  codexis  inc  received million from a private placement of its equity securities with third party investors 
codexis also received million from a concurrent private placement from maxygen 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  million of which may only be used for codexis operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund net operating losses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by investing activities in was million 
the cash used during and primarily represented purchases of available for sale securities 
the cash provided during was primarily from the maturities of available for sale securities 
additions of property and equipment were million in  million in and million in the additions in are primarily due to the expansion of our offices and laboratories in redwood city  ca as well as new equipment purchased for maxygen aps 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in the purchase of property and equipment to support our operations 
we may use a portion of our cash to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  or to obtain the right to use such technologies 
in connection with our joint venture  deltamax cotton llc  maxygen and delta and pine land company are committed to fund the joint venture in an amount sufficient to pay the anticipated development costs  but neither party is required to provide funding in excess of million 
during  we funded the joint venture through a capital contribution in the amount of million  which reflects our ownership interest 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the amount primarily consists of the net proceeds received from the sale of common stock in a public offering in march the cash provided in was primarily from the proceeds of the sale of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options by employees 
this was partially offset by payments on equipment financing obligations of  the cash provided in was primarily from the minority investment in codexis 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual commitments total year years operating leases long term debt total contractual commitments 
table of contents since inception we have received million in funding from our collaborators and from government grants  which includes million of deferred revenue to be recognized over the next three years 
approximately million was received from our collaborators and million was received from government funding 
assuming our research efforts for existing collaborations and grants are expended for their full research terms  as of december  we had total committed funding of approximately million remaining to be received over the next three years 
potential milestone payments from our existing collaborations could exceed million based on the accomplishment of specific performance criteria 
we may also earn royalties on product sales 
in general  the obligation of our corporate collaborators to provide research funding cannot be terminated by either party before the end of the research term unless there has been a material breach of contract or either party has become bankrupt or insolvent 
in the case of such an event  the agreement specifies the rights  if any  that each party will retain 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding received from collaborators and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
disclosure of non gaap financial measures when we report our financial results  ordinarily we report net income loss calculated both in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and also excluding stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets pro forma net income loss 
the latter measure of net income loss is considered a non gaap financial measure according to sec rules 
we believe that pro forma net income loss provides useful information in understanding our ongoing financial condition 
stock compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets are non cash expenses generated as a result of infrequent events that do not have direct operational significance 
as a result we believe that pro forma net income loss provides useful information to investors as to ongoing operations 
management uses pro forma net income loss in analyzing the performance of each of our operating business segments and in analyzing the performance of maxygen as a whole 
due to the usefulness of pro forma net income loss to our management we believe that it also provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all securities are held in us currency except for amounts held in our danish subsidiary in danish kroner 
as of december   approximately of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
in addition  we had outstanding debt related to equipment financing of  as of december   with a range of interest rates of between and 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  in we acquired a wholly owned subsidiary in denmark  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of maxygen aps is the danish kroner 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established a cash flow hedging program 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to maxygen 
at december  we had no foreign currency cash flow forward contracts outstanding
