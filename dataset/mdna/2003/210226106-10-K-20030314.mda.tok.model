golf operations revenues from golf operations rose in to  this gain in revenues was primarily achieved on a increase in revenues realized from food and beverage operations on increased activity 
this increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in revenues from golf course operations 
the decrease from golf occurred on a decline in number of rounds played  although the average rate per round increased 
operating expenses increased for the twelve month period when compared to prior year 
the rise in expenses  to  was attributed to additional costs associated with the increased food and beverage activity

interest and other income for included  realized on the sale of a portion of the auto dealership site in daytona beach  florida 
general and administrative expenses decreased in when compared to this decrease was primarily the result of charges in amounting to  from the exercise of stock options  along with an increase in expense from stock appreciation rights  due to the rise in the company s stock price 
net income and earnings before depreciation and deferred taxes net income of  equivalent to per share  for the year ended december  represented a significant improvement over the net loss of  posted in this turnaround was primarily due to the substantial improvement in profits from land sales 
also contributing to the favorable results were increased profits from income properties due to the increased rental property inventory in place and decreased general and administrative expenses 
the company also uses earnings before depreciation and deferred taxes ebddt as a performance measure 
the company s strategy of investing in income properties through the deferred tax like kind exchange process produces significant amounts of depreciation and deferred taxes 
this measure tracks results in this area 
following is the calculation of ebddt year ended december  december  net income   add back depreciation   deferred taxes   earnings before depreciation and deferred taxes   item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ebddt is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
further  ebddt is not necessarily indicative of cash availability to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes  however  that ebddt provides relevant information about operations and is useful  along with net income  for an understanding of the company s operating results 
ebddt is calculated by adding depreciation and deferred income taxes to net income as they represent non cash charges 
ebddt improved notably for the calendar year  not only due to the improved operating results  but also due to a significant change in deferred taxes 
the change in deferred taxes was predominantly the result of deferring gains on land sales closed during the year for income tax purposes through the like kind exchange process along with the payout and deduction of some deferred compensation expenses during the year 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided a significant increase in cash during  with cash totaling  at december  of cash on hand  is being held by a qualified intermediary to complete the acquisition of income properties through the deferred tax like kind exchange process

during   was used to acquire property  plant and equipment 
the primary asset acquired during the year was a  square foot triple net lease property occupied by eckerd  located in clermont  florida 
this property was acquired at a price of  the company paid dividends amounting to  equivalent to 
per share  during on july   the company entered into an  long term financing arrangement 
the new debt is for a ten year term  which variable rate debt has been effectively fixed at a rate of through an interest rate swap agreement 
this borrowing is secured by approximately  acres of the company s most western lands 
the funds provided by this financing were used to pay off the  term note  which became due july  in addition  the company has placed its unsecured  revolving line of credit with the same financing source 
there was no outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  the interest rate on the line of credit is the lower of above the day libor or below the prime market rate 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued capital expenditures for are projected to approximate  of this amount   will be used to acquire five properties currently under contract for closing in the first quarter of funds totaling  are being held by an intermediary and will complete the like kind exchange process from closings 
other capital expenditures for include  for site development of the cornerstone office park at the interstate interchange at lpga boulevard  and  for road construction on company owned lands adjacent to interstate capital to fund these requirements will be provided by cash on hand  maturing investment securities  operating activities  and financing sources in place 
additionally  as funds become available from qualified sales  the company expects additional triple net lease income properties will be acquired through the like kind exchange process 
currently  the income properties owned by the company are free of debt 
the company has the ability to borrow against these properties on a non recourse basis 
development activities  which tend to spur interest by buyers  continue to progress on company owned and surrounding lands 
these activities include the development of the cornerstone office park at the interstate interchange at lpga boulevard  the completion of the united state tennis association florida district headquarters facility on lands adjacent to the lpga international development and the sale of land for construction in of a  square foot medical facility 
also during the year  the company sold an additional acres of residential land within the lpga international development 
this property is expected to be developed into several distinct communities with lots sold to major homebuilders 
while national and local economic and political issues affect prospective development on company owned lands  at this time interest in real estate remains relatively strong  while a backlog of contracts is in place for closing in and future years 
management continues to focus its efforts on converting its contract backlog to closings while developing new contracts 
as closings occur  gains will continue to be deferred  when appropriate  for income tax purposes with the acquisition of triple net lease properties through the like kind exchange process 
in the event such closings on replacement properties do not occur within the required time frames  income taxes relative to the gains experienced would become currently payable 
as the inventory of triple net lease properties grows management will look to continue to diversify the company through other real estate investments as opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies the profit on sales of real estate is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of real estate at the time the sale is consummated unless the property is sold on a deferred payment plan and the initial payment does not meet criteria established under sfas  or the company retains some form of continuing involvement with the property 
no income has been deferred for the three years ended december  as sales have met the established criteria 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in accordance with sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company has reviewed the recoverability of long lived assets  including real estate held for development and sale and property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may or may not be recoverable 
real estate held for development and sale is evaluated for impairment by estimating sales prices less costs to sell 
impairment on income properties and other property  plant  and equipment is measured using an undiscounted cash flow approach 
there has been no material impairment of long lived assets reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at the time the company s debt was refinanced  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap arrangement changes the variable rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows so that the company can manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
this swap arrangement essentially creates the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
the above referenced transaction is accounted for under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas the accounting requires the derivative to be recognized on the balance sheet at its fair value and the changes in fair value to be accounted for as other comprehensive income or loss 
the company measures the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swap derivative by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
this measure resulted in no ineffectiveness for the year ended december  at december   a liability of  had been established on the company s balance sheet

income properties somewhat offsetting the lower earnings from commercial land sales and golf operations were higher earnings from income properties 
profits from income properties jumped to  in from  in the prior year 
the improved results were achieved with the acquisition of six new properties  primarily through the deferred tax like kind exchange process  in and the last quarter of general  corporate and other the sale of one acre of land and the release of acres of subsurface interests produced income of  for the year ended december  this compares to income of  generated on the sale of acres of undeveloped land and the release of subsurface rights on  acres for results for include the resolution of several income tax issues under examination with tax authorities  which resulted in the reduction of deferred income taxes by  item a
