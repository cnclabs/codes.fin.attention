amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the non amortization of goodwill under fas effective october  the increase in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase in the average balance of funds we invested  which were increased as a result of the completion in june of an equity offering resulting in million of proceeds to maximus  net of offering expenses 
the decrease in interest and other income in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower yields on funds we invest 
quarterly results set forth in item of this annual report on form k is selected income statement data for the eight quarters ended september  we derived this information from unaudited quarterly financial statements that include  in the opinion of our management  all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for such periods 
you should read this information in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our revenue and operating results are subject to significant variation from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the progress of contracts  the revenue earned on contracts  the timing of revenue on performance based contracts  the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter  the schedule of government agencies for awarding contracts  and the term of each contract that we have been awarded 
because a significant portion of our expenses are relatively fixed  successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
further  we have occasionally experienced a pattern in our results of operations pursuant to which we incur greater operating expenses during the start up and early stages of significant contracts prior to receiving related revenue 
our quarterly results may fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
business combinations and acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we intend to continue to selectively identify and pursue complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach and the breadth and depth of our services and to enhance our customer base

during the years ended september  and  we repurchased approximately  and  shares  respectively 
at september   million remained available for future stock repurchases under the program 
our working capital at september  and was and million  respectively 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million and no debt 
management believes this strong liquidity and financial position will allow us to continue our stock repurchase program  depending on the price of the company s common stock  and to pursue selective acquisitions 
restricted cash represents amounts collected on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes specified under our contracts with these customers 
under the provisions of a recently awarded long term contract  we expect to incur certain reimbursable transition period costs of up to million through december  during this transition period  these expenditures will result in the use of our cash or in us entering into lease financing arrangements for a portion of the costs 
reimbursement of these costs will occur over the months of the contract operating period  planned to commence january as of september   approximately million of these costs had been incurred and reported as deferred contract costs on our september  consolidated balance sheet 
also under the provisions of this contract  we issued a standby letter of credit facility in an initial amount of up to million  which amount shall be reduced to million on april  the letter of credit  which expires on march   may be called by a customer in the event we default under the terms of the contract 
the facility contains financial covenants that establish minimum levels of tangible net worth and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda and require the maintenance of certain cash balances 
in july  we entered into a capital lease financing arrangement with a financial institution  whereby we may acquire assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement 
rental installments for assets leased will be payable over a month period at a rate of  subject to certain adjustments  commencing in january at september   capital lease obligations of approximately million were incurred related to these lease arrangements for new equipment 
we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that we do not have significant off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds or letters of credit 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenue was derived from state and local government agencies  from federal government agencies  and from other sources  such as foreign and commercial customers 
our revenue is generated from contracts with various payment arrangements  including fixed price  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  performance based criteria  and time and materials used primarily by the consulting segment 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
for fiscal  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of our contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based and our contracts with the federal government have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts as services are provided based on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
also  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in full in the period in which such losses become known 
we recognize revenue on our performance based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed or determinable  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in large  irregular increments 
additionally  costs related to certain contracts are incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
certain of these direct costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized when reimbursement of such costs is contractually guaranteed 
these factors may result in irregular revenue and profit margins for performance based contracts  which exist in our consulting segment  health services segment and human services segment 
as a result  with performance based contracts we have more uncertainty regarding expected future revenue 
our most significant expense is cost of revenue  which consists primarily of project related costs such as employee salaries and benefits  subcontractors  computer equipment and travel expenses 
our management uses its judgment and experience to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects 
our management s ability to accurately predict personnel requirements  salaries and other costs as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed price  performance based and time and materials contracts 
if actual costs are higher than our management s estimates  profitability may be adversely affected 
service cost variability has little impact on cost plus arrangements because allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer 
we also license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fee revenue is recognized when a non cancelable license agreement is in force  the product has been shipped  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
in addition  when software license contracts contain post contract customer support as part of a multiple element arrangement  revenue is recognized based upon the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element 
maintenance and post contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements  which in most cases is one year 
revenue from software related consulting services under time and material contracts and for training is recognized as services are performed 
revenue from other software related contract services requiring significant modification or customization of software is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
human services segment and health services segment contracts generally contain base periods of one or more years as well as one or more option periods that may cover more than half of the potential contract duration 
as of september   our average human services segment and health services segment contract duration was approximately two years 
our consulting segment contracts had performance periods ranging from one month to approximately two years 
our average systems segment contract duration was one year 
impairment of goodwill 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations fas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under the new rules  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with fas and fas we elected to adopt fas and effective october   and as a result  amortization of goodwill was discontinued as of october  upon adoption  the required impairment tests were performed 
these impairment tests did not result in any impairment loss 
goodwill will be tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
annual impairment tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of our reporting units with which goodwill is associated 
losses  if any  resulting from annual impairment tests will be reflected in operating income in our income statement 
capitalized software development costs 
capitalized software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize both purchased software that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software development projects from the time technological feasibility is established 
capitalized software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
upon the general release of the software to customers  capitalized software development costs for the products are amortized based on the straight line method of amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  which ranges from three to five years 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment for recoverability of capitalized development costs require considerable judgment by management including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
any changes to these estimates could impact the amount of amortization expense and the amount recognized as capitalized software development costs in the consolidated balance sheet 
forward looking statements from time to time  we may make forward looking statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our confidence and strategies and our expectations about revenue  results of operations  profitability  current and future contracts  market opportunities  market demand or acceptance of our products and services 
any statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements 
the words could  estimate  future  intend  may  opportunity  potential  project  will  believes  anticipates  plans  expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these statements may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
examples of these risks include reliance on government customers  risks associated with government contracting  risks involved in managing government projects  legislative changes and political developments  opposition from government unions  challenges resulting from growth  adverse publicity  and legal  economic  and other risks detailed in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial
