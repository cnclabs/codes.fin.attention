item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as of january   we changed the name of our four major operating subsidiaries as part of a comprehensive branding initiative 
the new names of our four subsidiaries are sypris data systems  inc  formerly metrum datatape  inc  sypris electronics  llc  formerly group technologies corporation  sypris technologies  inc  formerly tube turns technologies  inc  and sypris test measurement  inc  formerly bell technologies  inc 
critical accounting policies and estimates our results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in assumptions and or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact our operating results 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion  units of delivery method of accounting 
this accounting method is applied by our electronics group for outsourced services provided under multi year contracts with aerospace and defense customers 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion  units of delivery method of accounting during  and  respectively 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are accepted by and shipped to the customer  with unit revenue derived based upon the total contract revenue and total units to be delivered over the life of the contract 
the corresponding recognition of cost of sales for the delivered units is based upon our estimates of costs to be incurred for the total contract 
under this approach  we compare estimated costs to complete an entire contract to total net revenue for the term of the contract to arrive at an estimated gross margin percentage for each contract 
each month  the estimated gross margin percentage is applied to the cumulative net revenue recognized on the contract to arrive at cost of sales for the period 
management reviews these estimates monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the change is known 
such changes to these estimates have not been material to our quarterly results of operations during the three year period ended december  if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
additionally  our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted demand for our products and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion  units of delivery method of accounting affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  revised estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices and customer specification and testing requirement changes 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
prior to  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method over its estimated period of benefit of years 
we have not recorded any impairments of goodwill since adopting sfas no 
consistent with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment and assess their recoverability based upon anticipated future cash flows 
if facts and circumstances lead us to believe that the cost of one of our assets may be impaired  we will write down that carrying amount to fair value to the extent necessary 
we have not recorded any impairments of long lived assets since adopting sfas no 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated income statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of net revenue years ended december  net revenue electronics group industrial group total net revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets special charges operating income net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in backlog at december  was million  a decrease of million from million at december  backlog for our electronics group and industrial group at december  was million and million  respectively 
net revenue for our electronics group in was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower revenue in manufacturing services and other outsourced services 
manufacturing services revenue decreased million primarily due to lower aerospace and defense shipments during and the completion of a commercial contract in the fourth quarter of other outsourced services revenue decreased million primarily due to a decline in revenue for test and measurement services 
weak economic conditions and a slowdown in the telecommunications  semiconductor  and commercial avionics markets negatively affected demand for test and measurement services from our customers 
product sales accounted for a decrease in net revenue of million during  primarily due to reduced sales quantities for magnetics products 
net revenue for our industrial group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in net revenue was primarily due to the full year effect of the may contract with dana corporation and the addition of a contract with visteon corporation 
the contract with dana for fully machined  medium and heavy duty truck axle shafts and other drive train components  generated outsourced services revenue totaling million in  as compared to million in under the contract with visteon we began supplying light axle shafts for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles during the first quarter of gross profit 
gross profit in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in increased to from in gross profit for our electronics group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin for our electronics group increased to in from in gross margin increased due to cost reductions  improved manufacturing efficiencies and a more favorable revenue mix in as compared to this improvement in margin was partially offset by lower profit resulting from a decrease in net revenue 
gross profit for our industrial group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin for our industrial group increased to in from in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to revenue growth from contracts with dana and visteon 
start up costs and manufacturing inefficiencies related to our initial production under the visteon contract limited the gross profit contribution from this business 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in was million  or of net revenue  as compared to million  or of net revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to additional management and administrative infrastructure to support the growth in our industrial group  partially offset by reduced selling expenses in our electronics group 
during the fourth quarter of  selling  general and administrative expense was of net revenue  primarily due to a reduction in our incentive bonus expense based on performance measures defined in our incentive plans 
research and development 
research and development expense in was million  or of net revenue  as compared to million  or of net revenue in our research and development spending in and was primarily attributable to our electronics group and was related to new product releases for the data systems product lines 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets ceased when we adopted sfas no 
effective january  amortization of intangible assets in was million  compared to million in interest expense  net 
interest expense in was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the decrease in interest expense from the comparable period reflects the repayment of debt with proceeds from our public stock offering combined with a reduction in our weighted average interest rate 
our weighted average debt outstanding decreased to approximately million for from approximately million for the weighted average interest rate for was approximately as compared to approximately for there was no capitalized interest for as compared to million for income taxes 
income tax expense was million in as compared to million in the effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for both years reflects research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits and a reduction in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance for and was million and million  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue 
net revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  from million in backlog at december  was million  an increase of million from million at december  backlog for our electronics group and industrial group at december  was million and million  respectively 
net revenue for our electronics group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in net revenue was primarily from contracts with aerospace and defense customers for manufacturing services  which generated an increase of million in over the prior year 
other outsourced services accounted for an increase in net revenue of million during product sales accounted for a decrease in net revenue of million during  primarily due to reduced sales quantities for data systems products 
net revenue for our industrial group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in during may  we entered into a new long term contract with dana  including the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and inventory from dana for approximately million in cash 
the assets are used to produce fully machined  medium and heavy duty truck axle shafts and other drive train components for integration into subassemblies produced for leading truck manufacturers 
this business generated outsourced services revenue of million during excluding the acquisition  the industrial group s net revenue declined million in from the prior year 
the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to a decline in outsourced services provided to customers in the heavy duty truck market 
unfavorable market conditions that arose during the second half of for heavy duty truck production resulted in an industry wide market decrease of approximately by the second half of and reduced the volume of axles we supplied to that market 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in gross margin in declined to from in gross profit for our electronics group in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the increase in manufacturing services revenue generated an increase in gross profit of million  while gross profit from other outsourced services decreased million 
gross margin in declined to from in manufacturing services comprised approximately of our electronics group s revenue in as compared to approximately in gross margin from manufacturing services improved slightly over the prior year  however  since gross margin on manufacturing services is lower than other outsourced services  the change in revenue mix contributed to the decrease in gross margin 
another factor in the gross margin decline was a slight decrease in gross margin on other outsourced services  primarily due to adverse economic conditions impacting demand and pricing for certain services provided to our customers 
gross profit from product sales decreased million during  primarily due to reduced demand for certain product offerings 
gross profit for our industrial group in was million  an increase of million or from million in excluding the new contract with dana  gross profit declined million in primarily due to the downturn of the heavy duty truck market 
the reduction in demand and corresponding impact on shipments occurred as our organizational infrastructure to support future growth plans was being developed 
the increased cost structure associated with the additional people and systems required to meet future contractual requirements and the underabsorption of overhead due to the volume decline resulted in a decline in our gross margin  excluding the impact of the new contract with dana  to in  as compared to for the prior year 
gross margin for our industrial group during  including the new contract with dana  was 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in was million  or of net revenue  as compared to million  or of net revenue in although net revenue increased from to and the new contract with dana added approximately million to selling  general and administrative expense during  our total selling  general and administrative spending decreased by million  or 
the decline in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to decreased selling expenses and commissions related to lower product sales for our electronics group  decreased marketing costs and cost reductions in both our electronics group and industrial group in response to the general weakness in the us economy 
research and development 
research and development expense in was million  or of net revenue  as compared to million  or of net revenue in the decrease in research and development expense was attributable to our electronics group  and was related to the quantity and timing of new product releases for the data systems product lines and the increased utilization of strategic alliances with suppliers for product development 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets in was million  a decrease of million  or compared to million in special charges 
special charges of million were recognized during for activities related to the consolidation of certain operations within our electronics group 
the consolidation activities were completed in and no such charges were recognized in interest expense  net 
interest expense in was million  an increase of million  or  from million in interest expense attributable to increased borrowings during was offset by a reduction in interest rates and the capitalization of interest incurred on our industrial group s capital expenditure program 
our weighted average debt outstanding increased to approximately million during from approximately million in this increase reflected the million acquisition from dana made by our industrial group in may and capital expenditures during and to support new business opportunities 
the weighted average interest rate in was approximately as compared to approximately for the prior year 
capitalized interest in was million as compared to million in income taxes 
income tax expense was million in as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the effective tax rate in was 
the effective tax rate for and the income tax benefit in reflect research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits and a reduction in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance for and was million and million  respectively 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities was million in  as compared to million in primarily due to an increase in net income and deferred income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by contributions to pension plans 
on november   we made a voluntary contribution to the pension plans totaling million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures for our electronics group and industrial group totaled million and million  respectively  in capital expenditures for our electronics group were principally comprised of manufacturing  assembly and test equipment 
our industrial group s capital expenditures included new forging and machining equipment to increase and expand the range of production capabilities 
our industrial group invested million  million and million during  and  respectively  in facilities  equipment and systems to support our growth in the truck components and assemblies market 
we substantially completed the investments for this growth during  which provides us with the capacity to serve the requirements of our existing multi year contracts with arvinmeritor  dana and visteon 
the industrial group s acquisition of certain assets related to the dana contract for million was included in investing activities in net cash provided by financing activities was million during as compared to million in we received net proceeds of million from our public stock offering during march and april prior to the offering  we reduced debt by million and proceeds from the offering were used to reduce debt by an additional million in dividends paid in totaled million 
subject to certain loan covenants  we had total availability for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility of million at december   which  when combined with the cash balance of million  provides for total cash and borrowing capacity of million 
our borrowing capacity was increased by million in july  as we agreed with our bank group to raise maximum borrowings on the revolving credit facility from million to million 
other terms of the credit agreement remained substantially unchanged 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
most acquisitions require the approval of our bank group 
our principal commitments at december  consisted of repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and obligations under operating leases for certain of our real property and equipment 
we also had purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december   primarily for manufacturing equipment 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our contractual obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter revolving credit facility 
  operating leases      total      we believe that sufficient resources will be available to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on our profitability  ability to manage working capital requirements and rate of growth 
if we make significant acquisitions or if working capital and capital expenditure requirements exceed expected levels during the next twelve months or in subsequent periods  we may require additional external sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
outlook the short term outlook for several of our electronic group s aerospace and defense customers is becoming less certain as these customers compete for funds that appear to be increasingly redirected to support the deployment of the us military to the middle east 
after the expected appropriation of funds for the war effort by congress  however  we believe the outlook for this portion of our business will regain its momentum 
as a result  comparable period growth in our electronic group is not expected to occur until the second half of as shipments are expected to increase on certain aerospace and defense contracts 
our industrial group expects a steady recovery in the production of medium and heavy duty trucks during the second half of the late decline in the heavy duty truck market is expected to stabilize during the first half of and increase over the balance of the year 
this anticipated rebound in the heavy duty truck market  combined with an expected increase in volume from supplying additional parts to our existing customers and the full year impact of the visteon contract  is expected to result in an increase in our industrial group s revenue in recently issued accounting standards effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 and its subsequent amendments  requires us to recognize all derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value must be recognized currently in earnings 
in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which are deemed to be effective hedges in accordance with sfas no 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but will be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
requires one accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held or used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our financial statements in forward looking statements this annual report may contain projections and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these projections and statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
no assurance can be given  however  that these events will occur or that these projections will be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of certain factors 
these factors include our dependence on our current management  the risks and uncertainties present in our business  including changes in laws or regulations  business conditions and growth in the general economy and the electronics and industrial markets served by us  competitive factors and price pressures  availability of third party component parts at reasonable prices  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand and or price erosion of purchased components  changes in product mix  cost and yield issues associated with our manufacturing facilities  the ability to successfully manage growth  the effects including possible increases in the cost of doing business resulting from future war and terrorists activities or political uncertainties  as well as other factors included in our periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on july   we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a syndicate of banks that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of  excluding our applicable margin  through july we entered into interest rate swap agreements as a means to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
approximately million of our outstanding debt was covered under the interest rate swap agreements at december  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
excluding the borrowings included in the interest rate swap agreements  all other borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate  the london interbank offered rate  or certain alternative short term rates  plus a margin at december  based upon our leverage ratio 
an increase in interest rates of basis points would result in additional interest expense of approximately  on an annualized basis  based upon our debt outstanding at december  the vast majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
as such  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have historically had little impact on us 
inflation has not been a significant factor in our operations in any of the periods presented and it is not expected to affect operations in the foreseeable future
