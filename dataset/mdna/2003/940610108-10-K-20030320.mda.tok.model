item legal proceedings reed lundy matter in june a lawsuit was filed against first bank and trust company first bank in providence county rhode island superior court by read lundy  inc and its principal  cliff mcfarland collectively  the plaintiffs 
the bank was substituted as defendant in june following the acquisition of first financial corp  the parent company of first bank 
the original complaint alleged claims for breach of contract  tortious interference with contractual relations  and civil conspiracy arising out of first bank s loan to a third party company 
the plaintiffs allege that the loan to the third party enabled that company to compete unlawfully with read lundy and thereby diminished read lundy s profitability 
the complaint was amended in december to add a claim for violation of the rhode island trade secrets act 
in december  a judgment in the favor of the bank and a dismissal of this lawsuit was rendered on all counts by way of summary judgment motion 
in december  the plaintiffs appealed the judgment 
the plaintiffs had previously filed a suit in the same court in against the third party company and its founder 
the bank is not a party to this suit 
in september  judgment was entered against the third party company and its founder in favor of the plaintiffs for approximately million in compensatory and punitive damages  including pre judgment interest 
the plaintiffs contend that the bank as an alleged co conspirator of the third party company is liable for this entire amount  none of which has been collected from the third party company 
the plaintiffs are also seeking additional compensatory damages and other costs allegedly arising after the third party trial 
including interest  it is estimated that the amount of the claim against the bank is approximately million 
management believes  based on its review with counsel of the development of this matter to date  that the bank has asserted meritorious defenses in this litigation 
the discovery phase of the case has been completed and the bank filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts 
as discussed above  in december  a judgment in favor of the bank and a dismissal of the suit was rendered on all counts by way of summary judgment motion 
in december  the plaintiffs appealed the judgment 
because of the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the litigation no assurance can be given that the litigation will be resolved in favor of the bank 
management and legal counsel are unable to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may be incurred with respect to this litigation 
consequently  no loss provision has been recorded 
a second claim ancillary to this litigation was brought by the plaintiffs in march the bank has also been substituted for first bank in these proceedings 
in this matter  the plaintiffs brought a motion seeking enforcement of a prejudgment writ of attachment obtained in by the plaintiffs against funds held by first bank as collateral for the loan to the third party company 
in  first bank had applied these funds as an offset to that loan 
in august  judgment against the bank was rendered on this motion requiring the bank to make the funds available for attachment by the plaintiffs 
this judgment is under appeal to the rhode island supreme court 
as of september   the corporation has recorded a liability for the judgment award of thousand in connection with this matter 
as a pre acquisition contingency  the offset to the liability has been recognized as a portion of the purchase price of first financial corp 
kiepler matter on february   a suit was filed against the bank in its capacity as trustee of the walfred m 
nyman trust the nyman trust in the united states district court for the district of rhode island the district court by beverly kiepler kiepler  as beneficiary of the nyman trust  for damages which the nyman trust allegedly incurred as a result of the bank s failure to file suit against robert c 
nyman  kenneth j 
nyman and keith johnson the co defendants for their wrongful dilution of the stock value of nyman manufacturing company nyman mfg  an asset of the nyman trust 
the amount of damages to the nyman trust caused by the alleged dilution was approximately million  based on the number of shares of nyman mfg 
that were held by the nyman trust 
kiepler has alleged that the bank breached its fiduciary duty by failing to join a suit brought by kiepler in her individual capacity as a shareholder of nyman mfg  against the co defendants 
this case is being vigorously contested by management 
management believes that the bank did not breach its fiduciary duties and that the allegations by kiepler are without merit 
because of the numerous uncertainties that surround the litigation  management and legal counsel are unable to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that the bank may incur with respect to this litigation 
consequently  no loss provision for this lawsuit has been recorded 
maxson matter on may   the bank entered into an agreement with maxson automatic machinery company maxson  a former corporate customer  and maxson s shareholders to settle a lawsuit for claims based upon theories of breach of fiduciary duty  negligence  breach of contract  unjust enrichment  conversion  failure to act in a commercially reasonable manner  and constructive fraud 
under the terms of the agreement  which did not involve an admission of wrongdoing  the bank agreed to pay million to the plaintiffs 
the cost of this settlement was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended march  net of the related income tax effect  the cost of the settlement amounted to million 
in connection with this matter  in august  and in december  the bank received settlements from insurance carriers in the amounts of thousand thousand net of tax and thousand thousand net of tax  respectively 
the recoveries were recorded as reductions of the litigation settlement cost included in other noninterest expenses 
no further insurance recoveries are expected 
the corporation is involved in various other claims and legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business 
management is of the opinion  based on its review with counsel of the development of such matters to date  that the ultimate disposition of such other matters will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the corporation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this report contains statements that are forward looking statements 
we may also make written or oral forward looking statements in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission  in our annual reports to shareholders  in press releases and other written materials  and in oral statements made by our officers  directors or employees 
you can identify forward looking statements by the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume  outlook  will  should  and other expressions which predict or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters 
you should not rely on forward looking statements  because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  some of which are beyond the control of the corporation 
these risks  uncertainties and other factors may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the corporation to be materially different from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that might cause these differences include the following changes in general national or regional economic conditions  changes in interest rates  reductions in the market value of trust and investment assets under management  reductions in deposit levels necessitating increased borrowing to fund loans and investments  changes in the size and nature of the corporation s competition  changes in loan defaults and charge off rates and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
in addition  the factors described under risk factors in item of this report may result in these differences 
you should carefully review all of these factors  and you should be aware that there may be other factors that could cause these differences 
these forward looking statements were based on information  plans and estimates at the date of this report  and we do not promise to update any forward looking statements to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors  new information  future events or other changes 
recent events subject to the approval of state and federal regulators  the corporation expects to open a full service branch office in warwick  rhode island in the second quarter  which will expand the bank s market area into kent county 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact income  are considered critical accounting policies 
the corporation considers the following to be its critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and review of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in the accounting policies that require material estimates and assumptions 
allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
the corporation uses a methodology to systematically measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio for purposes of establishing a sufficient allowance for loan losses 
the methodology includes three elements identification of specific loan losses  general loss allocations for certain loan types based on credit grade and loss experience factors  and general loss allocations for other environmental factors 
the methodology includes an analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america sfas 
other individual commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans are evaluated using an internal rating system and the application of loss allocation factors 
the loan rating system and the related loss allocation factors take into consideration parameters including the borrower s financial condition  the borrower s performance with respect to loan terms and the adequacy of collateral 
portfolios of more homogeneous populations of loans including residential mortgages and consumer loans are analyzed as groups taking into account delinquency ratios and other indicators  the corporation s historical loss experience and comparison to industry standards of loss allocation factors for each type of credit product 
finally  an additional unallocated allowance is maintained based on a judgmental process whereby management considers qualitative and quantitative assessments of other environmental factors 
for example  virtually our entire loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in southern new england  primarily rhode island and to a lesser extent in connecticut and massachusetts  and a substantial portion of the portfolio is collateralized by real estate in this area  including most consumer loans and those commercial loans not specifically classified as commercial mortgages 
a portion of the commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans are to borrowers in the hospitality and tourism industry 
further  economic conditions which may affect the ability of borrowers to meet debt service requirements are considered including interest rates and energy costs 
results of regulatory examinations  historical loss ranges  portfolio composition including a trend toward somewhat larger credit relationships  and other changes in the portfolio are also considered 
the corporation s audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for oversight of the loan review process 
this process includes review of the bank s procedures for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  administration of its internal credit rating systems and the reporting and monitoring of credit granting standards 
accounting for acquisitions and review of goodwill for impairment in april  the corporation completed its acquisition of first financial corp 
which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
for acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method  the corporation is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party  internal or other valuation techniques 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in goodwill or other intangible assets  which are subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using market value comparisons for similar institutions 
the valuation technique contains estimates as to the comparability of the selected market information to the specifics of the corporation 
furthermore  the determination of which intangible assets have finite lives is subjective  as is the determination of the amortization period for such intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisition of first financial corp  the corporation has recorded million of goodwill and million of intangible assets as of december  financial overview net income for the year ended december  amounted to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the corporation s rates of return on average assets and average equity for were and  respectively 
comparable amounts for the year were and  respectively

the complaint was amended in december to add a claim for violation of the rhode island trade secrets act 
in december  a judgment in the favor of the bank and a dismissal of this lawsuit was rendered on all counts by way of summary judgment motion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is one of the major market risks faced by the corporation 
the alco is responsible for establishing policy guidelines on liquidity and acceptable exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the alco is to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with washington trust s liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the alco manages the corporation s interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in the corporation s on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a month period 
the simulations assume that the size and general composition of the corporation s balance sheet remain constant over the month simulation horizon and take into account the specific repricing  maturity  call options  and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios 
non contractual savings deposits are classified as short term three months or less for both maturity and repricing purposes 
the characteristics of financial instrument classes are reviewed periodically by the alco to ensure their accuracy and consistency 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the negative exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a month horizon  and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
in addition  the alco reviews month horizon results to assess longer term risk inherent in the balance sheet 
as of december  and december   net interest income simulation indicated exposure to changing interest rates over a month horizon to a degree that remained within tolerance levels established by the corporation 
the corporation defines maximum unfavorable net interest income exposure to be a change of no more than in net interest income over the first months and no more than over the second months of the simulation horizon 
the following table summarizes the effect that interest rate shifts would have on net interest income for a month period using the corporation s on and off balance sheet financial instruments as of december  interest rates are assumed to shift by a parallel basis points upward  basis points upward or basis points downward over a month period  except for core savings deposits  which are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their historical insensitivity to rate changes 
further  deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall 
the asymmetric rate shift scenarios presented below reflect the fact that given the low level of interest rates at december   a parallel rate decline of basis points is extremely unlikely to occur  as this would effectively reduce many interest rates to zero 
it should be noted that the rate scenarios used do not necessarily reflect the alco s view of the most likely change in interest rates over the next months 
furthermore  since a static balance sheet is assumed  the results do not reflect the anticipated future net interest income of the corporation for the same period 
in addition  since income simulations assume that the corporation s balance sheet will remain static over the month simulation horizon  the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the alco could implement in response to rate shifts 
the following table presents these month net interest income simulation results dollars in thousands rate scenarios flat down up up rates basis points basis points basis points interest earning assets fixed rate mortgage backed securities     adjustable rate mortgage backed securities     callable securities     other securities     fixed rate mortgages     adjustable rate mortgages     other fixed rate loans     other adjustable rate loans     total interest income     interest bearing liabilities core savings deposits     time deposits     fhlb advances     other borrowings total interest expense     net interest income results as of december      net interest income results as of december      the alco estimates that the negative exposure of net interest income to falling rates results from the difficulty of reducing rates paid on core savings deposits significantly below current levels 
if rates were to fall and remain low for a sustained period  core savings deposit rates would likely not fall as fast as other market rates  while asset yields would decline as current asset holdings mature or reprice 
the pace of asset cash flows would also be likely to increase in a falling rate environment due to more rapid mortgage related prepayments and redemption of callable securities 
while the alco reviews simulation assumptions to ensure that they are reasonable and current  income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk since the repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments may change to a different degree than estimated 
specifically  mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans involve a level of risk that unforeseen changes in prepayment speeds may cause related cash flows to vary significantly in differing rate environments 
such changes could increase or decrease the amortization of premium or accretion of discounts related to such instruments  thereby affecting interest income 
changes in prepayment speeds can also affect the level of reinvestment risk associated with cash flow from these instruments  as well as their market value 
the sensitivity of core savings deposits to fluctuations in interest rates could also differ from the alco s simulation assumptions  and could result in changes in both liability mix and interest expense that differ from those used to estimate interest rate risk exposure 
the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities in changing interest rate environments 
the purpose is to determine market value exposure which may not be captured by income simulation  but which might result in changes to the corporation s capital position 
results are calculated using industry standard analytical techniques and securities data 
the following table summarizes the potential change in market value of the corporation s available for sale debt securities as of december  and resulting from immediate basis point parallel rate shifts dollars in thousands falling rising security type rates rates us treasury and government sponsored agency securities noncallable us government sponsored agency securities callable corporate securities mortgage backed securities   total change in market value as of december    total change in market value as of december    the corporation also monitors the potential change in market value of its available for sale debt securities using value at risk analysis 
the anticipated maximum market value reduction for the bank s available for sale securities portfolio at december   including both debt and equity securities  was  assuming a one year time horizon and a probability of occurrence for value at risk analysis 
on occasion  the corporation has supplemented its interest rate risk management strategies with off balance sheet transactions 
such transactions are intended to hedge specifically identified risks inherent in the corporation s balance sheet  and not to produce speculative profits 
the corporation has written policy guidelines that designate limits on the notional value of off balance sheet transactions and require periodic evaluation of risks associated with these transactions  including counterparty credit risk 
on may   the corporation terminated a five year interest rate floor contract with a notional amount of million that was to mature in february the floor contract was intended to function as a hedge against reductions in interest income realized from prime based loans and entitled the corporation to receive payment from a counterparty if the three month libor rate fell below 
in connection with the early termination  the corporation agreed to a final payment from the counterparty of thousand 
the corporation recognized the fair value of this derivative as an asset on the balance sheet and changes in fair value were recorded in current earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the interest rate floor contract
