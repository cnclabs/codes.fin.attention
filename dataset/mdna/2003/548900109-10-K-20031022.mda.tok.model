critical accounting policies the company must exercise judgment in estimating certain costs included in its results of operations 
footnote no 
to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and the fact that estimates and assumptions are inherent in the reported assets  liabilities  and results of operations 
the more significant areas of judgment relate to the warranty and inventory reserves 
with respect to warranty reserves  the company estimates both the expected return rates by the consumers and the estimated repair costs utilizing historical data 
with respect to inventory reserves  the company estimates the level of reserves based upon expected usage information for raw materials and historical selling trends for finished goods 
the company evaluates the effect of new product introductions on its finished goods inventory and determines at fiscal year end the amounts on hand for those products which the company expects to discontinue as a result of new product introductions during the next model year 
based on forecasted sales  these finished goods inventories are valued at cost  which management believes to be lower than expected net realizable value 
the estimates referred to above may be subject to adjustment if actual results differ significantly from historical trends and costs 
effects of inflation a significant portion of the company s costs and expenses consist of materials  supplies  salaries and wages that are affected by inflation

accordingly  the company concentrates on changes in design  manufacturing processes  material scheduling and sourcing to help contain costs 
a significant portion of the company s raw material items are sourced overseas 
significant devaluation of the dollar relative to these currencies would not be able to be passed on in the form of price increases to consumers
