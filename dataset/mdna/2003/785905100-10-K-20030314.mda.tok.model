item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary during  we generated revenues by providing travel marketing and distribution services to travel agencies  corporate travel departments and travel suppliers using the sabre system through our sabre travel network business segment formally travel marketing and distribution  to consumers using the travelocity websites  to businesses using getthere products and from the development and marketing of sabre airline solutions products 
approximately of our revenue was generated from sabre travel network  approximately from travelocity  from getthere and from sabre airline solutions 
total revenues from continuing operations have grown at a compound annual growth rate of for the three years ended december  air travel in was trending lower than in  initially because of the declining economic conditions in the united states  then due to the september  terrorist attacks 
as further discussed in the reduced volume of air travel section of business trends below  we have experienced significant decreases in bookings volumes due to reduced travel in the united states and  to a lesser degree  internationally following these attacks 
for the three years ended december   operating expenses from continuing operations have increased at a compound annual rate of 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of getthere  preview  gradient solutions limited now known as sabre ireland online limited  sabre pacific  dillon  site and the purchase of the remaining publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com that we did not previously own was million in  million in and million in amortization of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets ceased on january  upon our adoption of sfas no 
note to the consolidated financial statements  resulting in approximately million less amortization expense during than in absent the effect of the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  operating expenses from continuing operations have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 
our primary operating expenses consist of salaries  benefits  other employee related costs  communication costs and customer incentives  representing approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
those expenses increased at a compound annual rate of for the three years ended december   primarily due to higher customer incentives expenses 
as a result of lower than expected growth in travel bookings and revenues from the declining economy  the september  terrorist attacks  the possibility of terrorist attacks  hostilities and war  the financial instability of many of the air carriers  delays resulting from added security measures at airports and the shift to airline direct distribution  our revenues were only higher than revenues 
however  this growth in revenues  coupled with a decrease in operating expenses during this same period  resulted in an increase in operating margin to in from in and in the margin was lower due to increased amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and higher operating expenses during than in either or business trends 
our revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on united states airline travel bookings 
we are experiencing significant decreases in bookings volumes due to reduced travel in the united states and  to a lesser degree  internationally and due to increased efforts by airlines to divert bookings to alternative distribution channels 
reduced volume of air travel 
we attribute the lower travel activity principally to economic conditions in the united states and to ongoing travel security concerns 
air travel continues to be adversely affected by the state of the united states economy  by the possibility of terrorist attacks  hostilities and war  and by delays resulting from added security measures at airports 
travelers appear to be traveling less  remaining closer to home  deferring travel and substituting alternative methods of travel for air travel 
air travel in was trending lower than in  initially because of the declining economic conditions in the united states 
on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope involving the hijacking and destruction of multiple passenger aircraft operated by commercial air carriers 
bookings were down approximately immediately after the attacks 
by the end of  bookings volumes had partially recovered  to approximately lower than the same period in air travel bookings volumes recovered further during  and by the end of  air travel bookings were below levels and lower than because of the general economic decline that has occurred since september  our results of operations for the year ended december  were negatively affected by this continued reduction in travel 
our total bookings for in the us were approximately lower than the year ago period 
we are uncertain whether travel booking volumes will fully recover to historical levels  especially when compared to the year  which was a year in which we experienced historically high levels of travel bookings 
travel demands have been trending lower than expected for the first quarter of because of global security concerns and possible military action  as well as economic and political issues in latin america 
financial condition of airlines 
our airline customers are negatively affected by the continuing lower levels of travel activity 
several major carriers are experiencing liquidity problems 
some airlines have sought bankruptcy protection and others may consider bankruptcy relief 
the financial difficulties facing our airline customers increase the risk that they may not perform on our contracts with them  including the risk we may not be paid for services provided to them  although this risk may be mitigated by our participation in industry clearinghouses  which allow for centralized payment of service providers in the travel industry 
several air carriers have reduced the size of their fleets and the number of flights available or are implementing other cost saving measures 
these conditions may result in the airlines buying less of our products or services or seeking to reduce costs through price negotiation or other means 
supplier efforts to control travel distribution 
the airline owners of orbitz and worldspan are aggressively working to divert travel bookings onto channels that they collectively control 
those airlines have withheld inventory from independent travel distributors  have greatly reduced commissions paid to online and traditional travel agencies and have conditioned independent distributors access to inventory on their response to pricing offered by channels that those airlines control 
their collective efforts are resulting in travel bookings being diverted from traditional distribution channels toward airline controlled channels  such as orbitz  individual airline websites and call centers 
additionally  several hotels have announced plans for similar multi vendor websites for booking hotels and other accommodations 
merchant model 
independent travel distributors  including our travel marketing and distribution companies  are attempting to reduce their reliance on supplier paid commissions and booking fees by increasingly promoting a merchant model of travel distribution 
under this model  the distributor recognizes as revenue the sale price to the traveler less the cost of the inventory  rather than a supplier paid booking fee or commission 
merchant model content can include air  hotel and vacation offerings 
however  other travel suppliers are starting to offer their content on a merchant basis as well as through independent travel distributors 
merchant content is good for travelers because they can generally book their travel at a lower price than regularly published offerings 
for us  the merchant business generally delivers higher revenue per transaction than comparable sales under the agency booking fee model 
the potential effects of these trends  events and uncertainties are discussed below under risk factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ 
we have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our audit committee 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses each of our significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable we generate a significant portion of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from services provided to the commercial air travel industry 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were attributable to these customers 
our other accounts receivable are generally due from other participants in the travel and transportation industry 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  failure to pay amounts due to us or others  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past write off history average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due 
during and  the commercial air travel industry in particular  and the travel and transportation industry in general  was adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from a softening economy 
our airline customers are negatively affected by the continuing lower levels of travel activity 
several major domestic air carriers are experiencing liquidity problems 
some airlines have sought bankruptcy protection  and others may consider bankruptcy relief 
we believe that we have appropriately considered the effects of these factors  as well as any other known customer liquidity issues  on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
however  if demand for commercial air travel softens  due to prevailing economic conditions  terrorist acts  war or other incidents involving commercial air transport  or other factors  the financial condition of our customers may be adversely impacted 
if we begin  or estimate that we will begin  to experience higher than expected defaults on amounts due us  our estimates of the amounts which we will ultimately collect could be reduced by a material amount 
after nearly doubling our allowance for bad debts in to million  we reduced this allowance by million  or  to million at december  this reduction was driven primarily by a large payment from a customer in a bankruptcy dispute which resulted in a million reduction of the allowance 
booking fee cancellation reserve we record revenue for airline travel reservations processed through the sabre system at the time of the booking of the reservation 
however  if the booking is canceled in a later month  the booking fee must be refunded to the customer less a small cancellation fee 
therefore we record revenue net of an estimated amount reserved to account for future cancellations 
this reserve is calculated based on historical cancellation rates 
in estimating the amount of future cancellations that will require us to refund a booking fee  we assume that a significant percentage of cancellations are followed by an immediate re booking  without loss of revenue 
this assumption is based on historical rates of cancellations re bookings and has a significant impact on the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected cancellation rates or changes in booking behavior  our estimates of future cancellations could be increased by a material amount  and our revenue decreased by a corresponding amount 
at december  and  our booking fee cancellation reserves were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the cancellation reserve declined by million due to declining booking levels 
this reserve is sensitive to changes in booking levels 
for example  if booking volumes had been lower  the reserve balance would have been reduced by million 
business combinations during  and  we completed a number of acquisitions of other companies using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by our management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill 
long lived assets and goodwill prior to january   we reviewed all of our long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment when changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if we determined that such indicators were present  we prepared an undiscounted future net cash flow projection for the asset 
in preparing this projection  we made a number of assumptions concerning such things as future booking volume levels  price levels  commission rates  rates of growth in our consumer and corporate direct booking businesses  rates of increase in operating expenses  etc 
if our projection of undiscounted future net cash flows was in excess of the carrying value of the recorded asset  no impairment was recorded 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeded the projected undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment was recorded 
the amount of the impairment charge was determined by discounting the projected net cash flows 
intangible assets subject to amortization continue to be evaluated for impairment as discussed above 
through the end of  we evaluated goodwill for impairment based on undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the goodwill was less than the undiscounted projected future cash flows  no impairment would be recognized 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on january   we began to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the unit of our business to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of assumptions  as discussed above 
under sfas no 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to impairment tests annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  as generally estimated using a discounted future net cash flow projection  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
to date  we have not recorded a significant impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets 
we believe that assumptions we have made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet our expectations  we may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements syndicated lease financing as part of a syndicated lease arrangement  we are affiliated with a special purpose entity spe  which is also a variable interest entity as that term is defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that currently qualifies for off balance sheet treatment 
in  we arranged a syndicated lease financing facility of approximately million through this entity for the use of land  an existing office building and the construction of a new corporate headquarters facility in southlake  texas  as well as the construction of a new data center in tulsa  oklahoma 
the data center in tulsa was sold during the third quarter of and the balance of the lease facility is now approximately million 
we currently account for the financing facility as an operating lease 
as a result  neither the asset nor the related debt are recorded in our balance sheets at december  and in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements fin 
fin will significantly change current practice by requiring the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other pecuniary interests in the entity 
currently entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise which has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
this statement is to be applied to all new variable interest entities entered into after january  the statement will apply to all existing variable interest entities for periods beginning after june  as a result of the issuance of fin  we will begin consolidating the spe effective july  the spe leases the properties to us under a master lease agreement 
the initial lease term expires september  with two one year renewal periods thereafter  subject to specified lessor and lessee approvals 
at any time during the lease term  including the renewal periods  we have the option to purchase or sell the properties 
if the sell option is exercised  we have guaranteed to the lessor that proceeds on a sale will be at least of the original fair value of the leased facilities and we are responsible for the first dollar loss on a devaluation of the property of up to of the total funded value of the spe 
at december  taking into consideration the sale of the data center  the total guarantee approximated million 
we periodically evaluate whether any liability exists related to this residual value guarantee 
to date  we do not believe that any significant liability exists 
if the sales proceeds exceed the original fair value of the leased facilities  we retain the excess 
all capitalization of the spe has been provided by a consortium of independent banking institutions 
the banks have invested capital at risk exceeding of the capital of the spe 
therefore  we do not consolidate the spe in our financial statements 
if the invested capital at risk of the lenders declines below  or if certain other criteria are not met  we would be required to consolidate the spe prior to the effective date of fin had we consolidated the spe at december  after taking into consideration the sale of the data center  our reported assets would have increased by approximately million and reported liabilities would have increased approximately million  net of deferred taxes 
additionally  instead of rent expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  we would have recorded depreciation expense of million and million and interest expense of million and million  respectively 
seasonality the travel industry is seasonal in nature 
bookings  and thus fees charged for the use of the sabre system  decrease significantly each year in the fourth quarter  primarily in december  due to early bookings by customers for travel during the holiday season and a decline in business travel during the holiday season 
additionally  we had a million gain in the third quarter of resulting from our sale of france telecom shares 
the third and fourth quarters of and all of the quarters were also negatively impacted by the significant decrease in air travel and booking activity after the september  terrorist attacks and the resulting decline in both the travel industry and the overall economic climate

results of operations summary 
we generate revenues from continuing operations by providing travel marketing and distribution services to travel agencies  corporate travel departments and travel suppliers using the sabre system  to individuals through the travelocity websites  to businesses using getthere products  and from the development and marketing of sabre airline solutions products and services 
during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue from sabre travel network services  approximately from travelocity  from getthere and from sabre airline solutions 
revenues by business unit are exclusive of intersegment activity 
our consolidated operating margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
eds transaction 
on july   we completed a transaction with eds which provided for i the sale of our infrastructure outsourcing business and it infrastructure assets and associated real estate to eds  ii a year contract with eds to manage our it systems  and iii agreements with eds to jointly market it services and software solutions to the travel and transportation industries 
as a result of the eds transaction  our financial statements have been reclassified to present the results of operations of the information technology infrastructure outsourcing business as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction 
compared to revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network revenues decreased million or  from  million in to  million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in booking and other fees from associates  a million decrease in subscriber revenue and a million decrease in other revenues 
total worldwide travel bookings processed through the sabre system  which include direct connect bookings and joint venture bookings for which we or our distribution partners earn a booking fee  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million bookings in although bookings increased in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in  bookings have not recovered to the levels experienced prior to due to economic conditions in the united states  the ongoing travel security concerns discussed above and the shift to airline direct distribution 
the effect on revenues from the decreases in booking volumes were partially offset by a increase in average price per booking charged to associates during the decrease in subscriber revenue was a result of a declining base in equipment leased to subscribers 
other revenues fell mainly due to decreased development revenue from our joint ventures 
travelocity revenues decreased approximately million or  from million to million 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in air revenues of million  advertising revenues of million and the recognition of losses from our equity investments in joint ventures of million 
much like our sabre travel network segment  we believe that the decreases in air revenues can primarily be attributed to economic conditions in the united states and travel security concerns 
even though travelocity s gross travel bookings the total purchase price of all travel booked through travelocity s websites increased  average revenues per transaction were lower than we expected primarily as a result of changes in the air commission structure driven by the need to compete with an airline owned competitor s pricing scheme 
advertising revenues decreased due principally to the general softening of the online advertising market 
the losses from joint ventures relate to our investments in joint ventures for the establishment of online travel reservation sites in the far east and europe 
these joint ventures began operations during and losses were anticipated 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in non air revenues and a million increase in other revenue 
the increase in non air revenues can primarily be attributed to the launch  during  of travelocity s branded vacation and cruise programs and the acquisition of site  the last minute online travel leader 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding this acquisition 
other revenues increased primarily due to service charges for the handling and express delivery of certain paper tickets and the recognition of additional revenue related to warrants received from hotels 
com 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these warrants 
getthere revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in corporate and other revenues 
corporate and other revenues increased due to an increase in trip fees and revenues from partnerships with agencies such as american express 
corporate adoption rates  as measured by the estimated percentage of a corporation s total corporate travel expenditures purchased through getthere s online booking tools  have increased in we believe that this indicates that  despite the reduction in business travel  getthere s online booking tools are gaining widespread acceptance and use by the employees of its corporate customers 
for the year ended december   getthere s corporate business achieved bookings growth of year over year 
the increase in corporate and other revenues was partially offset by a million decrease in supplier revenue  which consists of services provided to air travel providers  such as united airlines  for hosting their consumer websites 
the decline reflects the decrease in travel as well as the loss of several customers 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million  due to an million increase in revenues from applications development products and services provided to various travel providers coupled with a million increase in airline reservation hosting revenue 
the increase in products and services was due to acquisitions and various product sales in airline reservation hosting revenue increased due to the signings of new carriers coupled with an increase in access fees 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network cost of revenues decreased million or  from  million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower communications and data processing costs of million resulting from lower transaction volumes and savings resulting from our it infrastructure outsourcing services contract with eds  which was effective july  the outsourcing agreement also resulted in lower depreciation and amortization of million due to the sale of subscriber equipment to eds in this transaction 
customer incentives decreased million due to lower booking volumes 
salaries and benefits decreased million due to december workforce reductions and lower incentive compensation expenses and all other operating expenses decreased million 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of increased data processing expenses of approximately million consisting of higher web hosting costs of million  increased purchased services of million and increased software costs of million 
salaries and benefits increased million due to increased headcount in getthere cost of revenues decreased million or  from million to million 
this improvement was primarily attributable to an million decrease in salaries and benefits resulting from workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives 
sabre airline solutions cost of revenues decreased approximately million or  from million to million 
this decrease was the result of lower other operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
salaries and benefits increased million to accommodate the growth in the business which occurred prior to the september  terrorist attacks 
facilities costs increased million to accommodate growth and as a result of moving into our new headquarter facilities and consolidating travelocity and getthere facilities 
approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses relates to the travelocity business and includes an million increase in amortization of payments made to strategic distribution partners  an million increase in advertising spending and a million increase in salaries  benefits and employee related costs and professional services as well as other administrative costs to support the business 
approximately million of the increase relates to the getthere business as a result of the purchase of getthere in october bad debt reserves increased million as a result of the events of september  depreciation increased million  data processing expenses increased million  communications expenses increased million and maintenance and device support expenses increased million in order to support the growth of the business 
other selling  general and administrative expenses increased to support our growth and as a result of costs which were historically allocated to the outsourcing business that are still being incurred as part of continuing operations 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  goodwill and intangible assets of approximately billion were recorded in connection with the merger of travelocity 
com and preview travel  the acquisitions of getthere  gradient solutions limited now known as sabre ireland online limited and a interest in dillon communications systems during  as well as the acquisition of sabre pacific in march acquired goodwill and intangible assets were being amortized over periods ranging from one to seven years 
amortization of this goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets ceased on january  upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
our adoption of sfas resulted in approximately million less of gross amortization expense related to these acquisitions during compared with this reduction was offset by an increase in amortization expense of million for intangible assets still subject to amortization due to the acquisition of sitecom  inc  the acquisition of the travelocity 
com minority interest and the impact of having a full year of amortization for intangible assets related to the acquisition of sabre pacific 
see the discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adopting sfas on accounting for acquired goodwill and certain intangible assets 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  as compared to the year ended december  from a million operating loss to a million operating income 
operating margins increased from in to during due to a decrease in operating expenses while revenues only declined 
this expense decrease was primarily due to reduced goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible asset amortization resulting from our adoption of sfas effective january  sabre travel network s operating income increased million or  due primarily to decreases in communications  data processing  depreciation and amortization  customer incentives and salaries and benefits during as compared to which more than offset the decline in revenue 
travelocity s operating loss decreased million or  due primarily to lower goodwill amortization charges 
getthere s operating loss decreased million due primarily to lower goodwill amortization and lower salaries and benefits 
sabre airline solutions operating income increased by million due to increases in product and services revenues and decreased operating expenses 
further  although we cannot precisely quantify the effect  we believe that and operating incomes in all operating segments were negatively impacted by the events of september   the subsequent decline in the travel industry and the general economy both domestically and internationally 
interest income 
interest income increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher average balances maintained in our cash and marketable securities accounts  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million or  from million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the retirement of million of debt in july and august  partially offset by interest on the million in aggregate principal amount of notes we issued august other  net 
other  net decreased million or  from million to million  from to other  net during was due primarily to a million gain from the sale of france telecom shares  partially offset by writedowns of investments we had made in companies developing emerging travel technologies totaling million 
the million in other  net during was primarily due to an million gain from the sale of our former corporate headquarters building  a million gain realized from the sale of france telecom shares and other investment gains of million  partially offset by million in writedowns of investments in companies developing emerging travel technologies 
minority interests 
minority interests include minority owners interests in our consolidated subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in april we acquired the approximately million publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com which we did not previously own 
accordingly  minority interests during only reflect these interests in travelocity 
com for the period prior to acquisition 
during  the full year net loss of travelocity 
com resulted in minority interests of approximately million 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was approximately which varies from the statutory us federal income tax rate of due primarily to state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was primarily as a result of the effect of the recognition of non deductible amortization expense for goodwill recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of getthere and preview travel in excluding the effects of the goodwill amortization  our effective tax rate for was 
the tax provision was reduced in both years due to the recognition of research and experimentation credits of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million from a loss of million during to income of million in this increase is primarily due to the million increase in operating income  partially offset by a million decrease in minority interests and a million increase in income taxes 
income from discontinued operations 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our information technology infrastructure outsourcing business to eds effective july  which resulted in net income from discontinued operations of million 
there were no discontinued operations during cumulative effect of accounting change 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  effective january  we recognized a non recurring cumulative gain in earnings for the year ended upon adoption of sfas of approximately million  net of minority interests of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million  relating to the hotels 
com warrants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net earnings 
net earnings increased million or  from million to million  primarily due to decreases in operating expenses of  which exceeded the decrease in revenues between years 
results of operations compared to revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network revenues increased million or  from  million during to  million during this increase was primarily due to a million increase from booking and other fees from associates which reflected a price increase of over prior year offset by a decrease in direct booking volumes of as a result of the decrease in travel due to the us economic slowdown and the events of september  the remaining increase of million was driven by an increase in leased subscriber equipment revenue 
travelocity revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase is due primarily to a million increase in transaction revenue  a million increase in advertising revenues and a million increase in other revenues 
the increase in transaction revenues was mainly due to a increase in gross travel bookings 
the growth in advertising revenues was primarily from the revenue sharing agreement with aol  and growth in other revenues was primarily due to service charges for the handling and express delivery of certain paper tickets and the recognition of additional revenue related to warrants received from hotels 
com 
getthere revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase is primarily a result of an million increase in corporate and other revenue and a million increase in supplier revenue  which consists of services provided to air travel providers  such as united airlines  for hosting their consumer websites 
these increases resulted primarily from the combination of getthere with our existing business travel solutions business in october corporate and other revenue increased due to an increase in trip fees and revenues from partnerships with agencies such as american express and other online customers 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million  due primarily to increases in applications development performed on behalf of various travel providers 
further  although we cannot precisely quantify the effect  we believe that revenue was negatively impacted by the events of september  in all operating segments 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network cost of revenues decreased million or  from  million to  million  as the result of million of depreciation savings resulting from the sale of subscriber equipment to eds effective july  and a million net decrease in all other operating expenses 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million  as the result of increased salaries and benefits due to the growth of the business in getthere cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million  as the result of increases in salaries and benefits of million  development labor of million  depreciation of million and other operating expenses of million resulting from the growth of the business during sabre airline solutions cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million  due primarily to increases in salaries and benefits of million and other operating expenses of million to support increased applications develpment workloads 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses relates to the travelocity business and includes an million increase in amortization of payments made to strategic distribution partners  an million increase in advertising spending and a million increase in salaries  benefits  employee related costs and professional services as well as other administrative costs to support the business 
approximately million of the increase relates to the getthere business as a result of the purchase of getthere in october the remaining million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to increases in bad debt reserves of million as a result of the events of september  and increases in advertising and promotion costs  distributor incentives and other selling  general and administrative expenses to support our growth  as well as costs historically allocated to the outsourcing business that are still being incurred as part of continuing operations 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets increased million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the impact in of recognizing a full year of amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisitions of getthere and preview travel 
we recorded approximately billion of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the merger of preview and travelocity 
com and the acquisitions of getthere  gradient solutions limited now known as sabre ireland online limited and an interest in dillon in  as well as the purchase of sabre pacific and other immaterial acquisitions 
the majority of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are being amortized over periods ranging from one to seven years 
as of january   we no longer amortize goodwill and certain other intangible assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding this new accounting pronouncement 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  decreased million or  as compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
operating margins decreased from in to in  due to an increase in operating expenses of partially offset by a increase in revenues 
sabre travel network s operating income decreased million or  due to increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization 
travelocity s operating loss decreased million due to increases in transaction services revenues from associates and increases in advertising revenues  slightly offset by increased goodwill amortization and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
getthere s operating loss increased million due primarily to higher goodwill amortization 
sabre airline solutions operating loss decreased by million due to increases in product and services revenues that were slightly offset by increased operating expenses 
we believe that the events of september  had a negative impact on operating income in all operating segments  although we cannot precisely quantify this effect 
interest income 
interest income increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher average balances maintained in our cash and marketable securities accounts  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million or  from million to million as a result of interest expense related to the million of borrowings to finance the purchase of getthere and interest expense on the million in unsecured notes which we issued on august  other  net 
other  net increased million  from million to million primarily due to a million gain from the sale of france telecom shares  partially offset by a million writedown of investments we had made in companies developing emerging travel technologies 
minority interests 
minority interests include minority owners interests in our consolidated subsidiaries  primarily travelocity 
com 
the decrease in losses attributable to minority interest is due primarily to a decrease in the net loss of travelocity 
com 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
our effective tax rates for and were approximately and  respectively  primarily as a result of the effect of the recognition of non deductible amortization expense for goodwill recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of getthere and preview travel in excluding the effects of the goodwill amortization  our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
both years benefited from the recognition of a research and experimentation credit of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations decreased million or  from million in to million in due to an increase in revenues of only as a result of the negative effect of the events of september  which was more than offset by an increase of operating expenses of 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations increased million or  from million to million for and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations in includes a gain of approximately million  net of related income taxes  resulting from the disposition of the outsourcing business and related assets to eds in july of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction 
discontinued operations have been fully allocated with selling  general and administrative expenses to be representative of the business as it operated during the relevant periods 
some of the selling  general and administrative expenses historically allocated to the information technology outsourcing business will still be incurred as part of continuing operations in the future 
cumulative effect of accounting change

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net earnings 
net earnings decreased million or  from million to million  primarily due to decreases in operating income and increases in interest expense in compared to liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities and working capital of million compared to million in cash and marketable securities and working capital of million at december  we invest cash in highly liquid instruments  including high credit quality money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  bankers acceptances  commercial paper  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes 
historically  we have funded our operations through internally generated cash 
we generated cash from operating activities of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to primarily resulted from the significant reduction in accounts receivable during due to the collection of accounts receivable from our outsourcing business customers outstanding at december  with no corresponding billings and collections in  due to the sale of the outsourcing business to eds 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to primarily resulted from the non recurrence of an million payment made to us airways in in connection with an outsourcing contract sold to eds on july  and positive working capital variances as described above  net of certain gains recognized during we used cash for investing activities of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for investing activities during as compared to primarily results from the cash tender offer for the outstanding publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com for million  the acquisition of site for million net of cash received of million and the purchase of the data center facility from the lessor  netted against the proceeds of selling the same data center to eds  of million 
we estimate that million remains to be paid for the travelocity 
com acquisition 
these increases in cash used during were partially offset by million of cash received from the sale of our former headquarters building 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities during as compared to primarily results from proceeds realized from the sale of our outsourcing business to eds for approximately million  proceeds of approximately million from the sale of france telecom depository certificates which we held  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and million from the exercise of warrants and disposal of stock of hotels 
com 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these warrants 
cash expended for business acquisitions was million  million and million  net of cash acquired  in  and  respectively 
the increase during was due to the cash tender offer for the outstanding publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com for million and the acquisition of site for approximately million  net of million cash acquired 
the large expenditure during primarily resulted from the acquisition of getthere 
we invested excess cash of approximately million and million in marketable securities  net of marketable securities sold  during and  respectively 
during  we used cash from the sale of marketable securities of approximately million  net of marketable securities purchased  to help finance the payment of a million dividend in february we try to invest all excess cash in marketable securities 
therefore  our annual investments will fluctuate depending on the levels of cash provided or used by all of our other investing  operating and financing activities 
capital investments for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the reduction in capital expenditures from to and is due to reduced acquisitions of it assets resulting from our it infrastructure outsourcing services contract with eds 
we believe that future capital expenditures will be slightly higher than due to purchases of equipment 
however  we do expect capital expenditures to remain significantly lower than during the third quarter of  we made an unsecured million loan to a customer in the travel industry  which was repaid in march we provided million and used million in cash for financing activities during and  respectively 
during  we provided approximately million through financing activities 
during  we borrowed approximately million  primarily to finance the acquisition of getthere 
we repaid these borrowings during primarily using proceeds from the sale of our outsourcing business and the issuance in august of by sabre holdings corporation of million in unsecured notes notes  bearing interest at and maturing august   in an underwritten public offering resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt transactions 
sabre inc  a owned subsidiary of sabre holdings corporation  unconditionally guarantees all debt obligations of sabre holdings corporation as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with these notes  we have entered into two interest rate swaps through for a total of million  which pay us and on which we will pay a variable rate based on a six month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these swaps 
in february  we entered into a million senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which expires on september  interest on this agreement is variable  based upon the libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus a margin  at our option 
at december  and  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this agreement and the entire million is available for us to draw upon if necessary 
we are currently in compliance with all debt covenant requirements under this agreement 
in april  we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of class a common stock at per share  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  net of transaction fees 
we are using the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
during  we generated million in cash through financing activities pursuant to stock options  restricted stock incentives and stock purchase plans 
this compares to million and million that was raised in and  respectively 
we had not paid any dividends on our common stock before the one time cash dividend of million was paid in february in connection with our separation from amr  nor have we paid any since 
although we have traditionally retained our earnings to finance future growth  we may consider paying dividends in the future if we feel it is in the best interest of our shareholders 
any determination as to the future payment of dividends will depend upon our future results of operations  capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors may consider  including any contractual or statutory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
during  we repurchased million of our shares at a total cost of million 
this completed our remaining authorization to repurchase our shares 
we repurchased million of our shares at a total cost of million in and spent approximately million buying shares of our own stock in we may consider additional share repurchases  but such repurchases would require approval from our board of directors 
the timing  volume and price of any authorized future repurchases would be made at the discretion of management and would depend on corporate considerations and market conditions 
in  we entered into an agreement with aol that provides  among other things  that the travelocity websites will be the exclusive reservations engine for aol s internet properties 
travelocity is obligated for payments of up to million  subject to aol meeting certain revenue targets  a percentage of which are shared with us over the five year term of the agreement 
aol and travelocity will share advertising revenues and commissions over the five year term of the agreement 
as of december   travelocity is obligated for future payments of up to million  as we have paid approximately million per year in  and under certain circumstances  travelocity may elect to alter the terms of this agreement such that guaranteed payments to aol would no longer be required 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an agreement with yahoo whereby travelocity will be the exclusive air  car and hotel booking engine on yahoo travel 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to purchase certain levels of advertising  corporate services and enterprise solutions from yahoo the companies also plan to jointly develop travel solutions for the millions of individuals  travel agents and travel suppliers that rely on the firms extensive networks 
minimum payments due to yahoo under the terms of the agreement were million during  million during and million per year in both and the agreement also contains a productivity component  where yahoo is paid a percentage of the transactions services revenue generated through the yahoo network 
as of december   we are obligated for total future payments of million  as we paid approximately million during the agreement is effective july  and expires december  the agreement can be extended for up to two years at yahoo s option 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of this agreement 
contractual cash obligations our future minimum noncancelable contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands of dollars payments due by period for the years ended december  contractual obligations thereafter notes payable  lease obligations      amounts receivable under non cancelable subleases   other long term obligations    total contractual cash obligations    see note to the consolidated financial statements 
primarily composed of obligations under i our agreement with aol for travelocity to be the exclusive reservations engine for aol s internet properties  ii our agreement with yahoo for travelocity to be the exclusive air  car and hotel booking engine on yahoo travel and iii minimum amounts due to eds under the terms of the it outsourcing agreement 
we believe available balances of cash and short term investments  cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders  or restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
if market conditions warrant  we may engage in additional financing transactions 
in addition  to the extent we consider additional acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  such additional activities might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations

inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
sabre holdings corporation cautionary statement statements in this report which are not purely historical facts  including statements regarding our anticipations  beliefs  expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies for the future  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all forward looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
risk factors general risks associated with an investment in our securities  and with achieving the forward looking statements in this report  our news releases  our websites  public filings  investor and analyst conferences and elsewhere  include  but are not limited to  the risk factors described below 
any of the risk factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not succeed in addressing these challenges and risks 
our revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on the airlines  and a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could adversely affect us 
most of our revenue is derived from airlines  hotel operators  car rental companies and other suppliers in the travel and transportation industries 
our revenue increases and decreases with the level of travel and transportation activity and is therefore highly subject to declines in or disruptions to travel and transportation 
the travel industry is seasonal and our revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that may adversely affect travel and transportation activity include price escalation in travel related industries  airline or other travel related labor action  political instability  hostilities and war  inclement weather  fuel price escalation  increased occurrence of travel related accidents  acts of terrorism  economic downturns and recessions  and the financial condition of travel suppliers 
the september  terrorist attacks on new york and washington  and the economic downturn that preceded and was worsened by the attacks  may continue to adversely affect us and the travel industry 
additionally  the possibility of terrorist attacks  hostilities and war  the financial instability of many of the air carriers  and delays resulting from added security measures at airports may continue to adversely affect the travel industry 
airlines may reduce the number of their flights  making less inventory available to us 
several major airlines are experiencing liquidity problems and some have sought bankruptcy protection 
travelers perceptions of passenger security or airlines financial stability may have an adverse effect on demand 
a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could have an adverse impact on our financial performance  operations  liquidity  or capital resources and could impair our ability to recover the carrying value of certain of our assets  including capitalized software  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we face competition from established and emerging travel distribution channels  which could divert customers to our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business includes channels of distribution that target the travel agency  corporate direct and consumer direct segments of the global travel distribution market 
in all of these distribution channels  we face significant competitors  many of whom are aggressively seeking to divert our customers away from traditional distribution methods 
in the travel agency channel  our sabre global distribution system competes primarily against other large and well established global distribution systems  including those operated by amadeus  gailileo and worldspan 
in addition  we face competition in the travel agency channel from travel suppliers that distribute directly to travel agencies and from other companies 
in the corporate direct channel  our getthere business competes against similar products offered by amadeus  galileo  worldspan and travel agencies 
some competitors market business travel systems that are bundled with financial and other non travel software systems that we do not offer 
as a result  our customers may choose to use our competitors bundled products and services  which would reduce the revenue we otherwise would have earned from these customers 
in the consumer direct channel  our travelocity product competes not only against similar products offered by affiliates of amadeus  galileo and worldspan  but also with a large number of travel websites  including those operated by travel suppliers and by expedia  hotwire and orbitz 
consolidation among travel suppliers  including airline mergers  may increase competition from distribution channels related to those suppliers and place more negotiating leverage in the hands of those suppliers 
if we are unable to compete effectively  competitors could divert our customers away from our travel distribution channels and  unless we substitute alternative revenue streams  it could adversely affect our results of operations 
some travel suppliers are aggressively seeking to bypass our travel distribution channels  which may have the effect of adversely affecting our results of operations 
some travel suppliers are aggressively seeking to decrease their reliance on global distribution systems such as our sabre system 
airlines and other travel suppliers have significant ownership stakes in some of our global distribution system competitors  such as amadeus  galileo and worldspan 
various airlines and hotels have established their own travel distribution websites 
several airlines and hotels have formed joint ventures that offer multi supplier travel distribution websites such as orbitz in the united states and opodo in europe 
many of these travel suppliers offer discounted prices when their products and services are purchased from these supplier related websites 
many of these discounted prices have not been made available to us 
these pricing differences may have the effect of diverting customers from our distribution system to supplier related websites 
consolidation in the travel agency industry and increased competition for travel agency subscribers may result in increased expenses  lost bookings and reduced revenue 
the absolute and relative size of our travel agency subscriber base is important to our success 
some travel suppliers have reduced or eliminated commissions paid to travel agencies including consumer direct travel sites like travelocity 
the loss of commissions causes travel agencies to become more dependent on other sources of revenues  such as traveler paid services fees and gds paid incentives 
the reduction or elimination of supplier paid commissions has forced some smaller travel agencies to close or to combine with larger travel agencies 
although we have a leading share of large travel agencies  competition is particularly intense among global distribution systems for larger travel agency subscribers 
consolidation of travel agencies may result in increased competition for these subscribers 
some of our competitors aggressively pay economic incentives to travel agencies to obtain business 
in order to compete effectively  we may need to increase incentives  pre pay incentives  increase spending on marketing or product development  or make significant investments to purchase strategic assets 
if we do not retain subscribers representing a significant percentage of historic bookings through our global distribution system  our booking fee revenues would decrease 
airlines that are divesting their ownership of global distribution systems might limit their participation in our global distribution system services  which would adversely affect our booking fee revenue and our results of operations 
rules in the us  canada  the european union and peru govern computer reservation systems such as our sabre global distribution system 
airlines such as british airways  united airlines  us airways and continental airlines that divest their ownership of global distribution systems may not be subject to these rules  which would otherwise require them to make their inventory available in our global distribution system in a non discriminatory manner 
we could be adversely affected by a decision by one or more large airlines to discontinue or limit their distribution of inventory through global distribution systems 
losing access to their inventory would make our global distribution system less attractive to travel agencies and travel purchasers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
in order to gain access to inventory  it might become necessary for us to reduce the fees charged to suppliers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
some of our competitors in the business are well funded  which may give these competitors a competitive advantage that could adversely affect our results of operations 
some of our competitors are owned by companies that are larger than us  and that may have better access to capital than we do 
this may afford them the ability to take advantage of more business opportunities  including acquisitions  business combinations and strategic alliances 
they may have greater resources to enable them to finance strategic transactions and research and development in the business 
these competitive advantages could allow our competitors to offer products and services for less than we can  which could reduce demand for our products and services and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be unsuccessful in pursuing and integrating business combinations and strategic alliances  which could result in increased expenditures or cause us to fail to achieve anticipated cost savings or revenue growth 
we plan to continue to examine possible business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence 
there are risks inherent in these types of transactions such as difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  disruption of our ongoing business  including loss of management focus on existing businesses and other market developments  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with amortization of identifiable intangible assets  additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses  impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners  and fluctuations in value and losses that may arise from equity investments 
in addition  we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for business combinations and strategic investments  obtain financing or acceptable terms for such business combinations and strategic investments  or otherwise make such business combinations and strategic investments on acceptable terms 
rapid technological changes and new distribution channels or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may render our technology obsolete or adversely affect the value of our current or future technologies to us and our customers  which could cause us to increase expenditures to upgrade our technology or develop competing products in new distribution channels and to protect them 
new distribution channels and technology in our industry are evolving rapidly 
our ability to compete and our future results depend in part on our ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to our technology to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands and rapid advancements in technology  and to protect our technology 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on us  and our legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages to our business caused by such use 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that products  technologies or services developed by others will not render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which we focus our research and development investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
our systems may suffer failures  capacity constraints and business interruptions  which could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose customers 
our businesses are largely dependent on the computer data centers and network systems operated by eds 
we rely on several communications service suppliers and on the global internet to provide network access between our computer data center and end users of our services 
we occasionally experience system interruptions that make our global distribution system or other data processing services unavailable 
much of our computer and communications hardware is located in a single facility 
our systems might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities or war or similar events 
computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions affecting the global internet or our systems might cause service interruptions  delays and loss of critical data 
problems affecting our systems could significantly diminish our reputation and brand name and prevent us from providing services 
although we believe we have taken adequate steps to address these risks  we could be harmed by outages in  or unreliability of  the data center or network systems 
regulatory developments could limit our ability to compete by restricting our flexibility to respond to competitive conditions  which could cause our customers to be diverted to our competitors and adversely affect our revenue and results of operation 
the us department of transportation dot released its notice of proposed rule making nprm on november  as part of its comprehensive review of its rules governing computer reservation systems crs such as our sabre global distribution system 
if those rules were to become final in their current form  we would be adversely affected 
in particular  the rules could facilitate efforts by the airline owners of orbitz and worldspan to divert travel bookings to distribution channels that they own and control 
carriers that own crs systems would no longer be required to participate in competing systems 
the proposed rules would also reduce the value of marketing information sold by sabre to airline associates 
furthermore  the proposed rules would apply to traditional crs systems but not to travel distribution websites  even if they have the same functionality as a traditional crs system and even if accessed by travel agents 
the nprm is not the final rule 
there will an opportunity for interested parties to make their concerns known to the dot 
we intend to seek changes to eliminate aspects of the regulations that negatively impact our business 
the proposed rules may be implemented with few changes  may be implemented with major changes or we may see crs systems become completely de regulated 
we do not know when the proposed regulations might become final or whether our changes will be accepted 
we expect that our business will likely be adversely affected under any of the possible scenarios 
the commission of the european union the commission is also engaged in a comprehensive review of its rules governing crs systems 
it is unclear at this time when the commission will complete its review and what changes  if any  will be made to the eu rules 
we could be unfairly and adversely affected if the eu rules are retained as to traditional global distribution systems used by travel agencies but are not applied to travel distribution websites owned by more than one airline 
we could also be adversely affected if changes to any of the foregoing crs rules increased our cost of doing business  weakened the non discriminatory participation rules to allow one or more large airlines to discontinue or to lower its level of participation in our global distribution system  or caused us to be subject to rules that do not apply to our global distribution competitors 
we face trade barriers outside of north america that limit our ability to compete  which could require us to increase incentives  reduce prices  increase spending on marketing or product development  or otherwise to take actions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
trade barriers erected by non us travel suppliers  who are historically often government owned  have on occasion prevented us from offering our products and services in their markets or have denied us content or features that they give to our competitors 
those trade barriers make our products and services less attractive to travel agencies in those countries than products and services offered by other global distribution systems that have such capability 
the potential for us to add new travel agency subscribers exists primarily outside of north america 
those trade barriers have restricted our ability to gain market share outside of the us competition in those countries could require us to increase incentives  reduce prices  increase spending on marketing or product development  or otherwise to take actions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
our international operations are subject to other risks  which may impede our ability to grow internationally and adversely affect our overall results of operations 
we face risks inherent in international operations  such as risks of currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  restrictive governmental actions  such as trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  import or export licensing requirements  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  nationalization  different accounting practices and potentially longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  higher costs of doing business  consumer protection laws and restrictions on pricing or discounts  lack of  or the failure to implement  the appropriate infrastructure to support our technology  lesser protection in some jurisdictions for our intellectual property  disruptions of capital and disruptions of trading markets  laws and policies of the us affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and foreign tax and other laws 
these risks may adversely affect our ability to conduct and grow business internationally  which could cause us to increase expenditures and costs  decrease our revenue growth or both 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities portfolio 
largely offsetting this exposure are our notes payable  as hedged with fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the objectives of our marketable securities are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as such  our investment portfolio consists primarily of high credit quality certificates of deposit  bankers acceptances  commercial paper  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes 
if short term interest rates average lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if short term interest rates averaged lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our marketable securities balances  including marketable securities held by travelocity  as of december  and in addition  we had fixed rate notes of million notes at december  we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding notes  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate notes into floating rate obligations 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate borrowings balance at december  in addition  we had floating rate exposure on the approximately million funded under our syndicated lease facility at december  if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our lease expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our average syndicated lease balance at december  if our mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities changes significantly  we may enter into additional derivative transactions to manage our net interest exposure 
foreign currency risk we have various foreign operations  primarily in north america  south america  europe  australia and asia 
as a result of these business activities  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  these exposures have historically related to a small portion of our overall operations as a substantial majority of our business is transacted in the united states dollar 
we were a party to certain foreign currency derivative contracts at december  and these contracts were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of or for the year ending december  or
