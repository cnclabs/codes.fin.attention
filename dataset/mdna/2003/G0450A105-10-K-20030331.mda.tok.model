item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our current assessment of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements and  therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on them 
important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements are discussed in this report  including the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  and our company risk factors 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented under item general the company we are a bermuda public limited liability company with over billion in equity capital and  through operations in bermuda and the united states  we write insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis 
while we are positioned to provide a full range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines  we are focusing on writing specialty lines of insurance and reinsurance 
in october  we launched an underwriting initiative to meet current and future demand in the global insurance and reinsurance markets that included the recruitment of new insurance and reinsurance management teams and an equity capital infusion of million 
it is our belief that our existing bermuda and us based underwriting platform  our experienced management team and our strong capital base that is unencumbered by significant exposure to pre risks have enabled us to establish an immediate presence in an attractive insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
in april  we completed an offering of  of our common shares and received net proceeds of million and  in september  we received proceeds of million from the exercise of class a warrants by our principal shareholders and certain other investors 
history we commenced operations in september following the completion of the initial public offering of our predecessor  arch capital group us inc us 
us is a delaware company formed in march under the original name of risk capital holdings  inc from that time until may  we provided reinsurance and other forms of capital to insurance companies 
on may   we sold our prior reinsurance book of business to folksamerica reinsurance company in an asset sale  but retained our surplus and our us licensed reinsurance platform 
on november   following shareholder approval  we changed our legal domicile to bermuda in order to benefit from bermuda s favorable business  regulatory  tax and financing environment 
during the period from may through the announcement of our underwriting initiative in october  we built and acquired insurance businesses that enable us to generate both fee based revenue eg  commissions and advisory and management fees and risk based revenue ie  insurance premium 
as part of this strategy  we built an underwriting platform that is intended to enable us to maximize risk based revenue during periods in the underwriting cycle when we believe it is more favorable to assume underwriting risk 
in october  we concluded that underwriting conditions favored dedicating our attention exclusively to building our insurance and reinsurance business 
due to the significant changes in our business during the years  and  we believe the comparisons of our results of operations in such periods are not relevant 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from our issuance of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are driven by the volume and classes of business of the policies and contracts that we write and prevailing market prices 
the premium we charge for the risks assumed is priced based on many assumptions 
we price these risks well before our ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 
in addition  our revenues include fee income and income we generate from our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income investments that are held as available for sale 
under our basis of accounting  which is gaap  these investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the investments are not included in our statement of operations 
rather  these unrealized gains and losses are included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses primarily consist of losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs  other operating expenses and non cash compensation 
losses and loss adjustment expenses include management s best estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred during a reporting period 
such costs consist of three components paid losses  changes in estimated amounts for known losses case reserves  and changes in reserves for incurred but not reported ibnr losses 
see critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for further discussion 
acquisition expenses consist primarily of commissions  brokerage and taxes paid to obtain our business 
a significant portion of such costs is paid based on a percentage of the premium written and will vary for each class or line of business that we underwrite 
other operating expenses  a significant portion of which are general and administrative expenses  consist primarily of compensation related expenses 
non cash compensation relates to certain grants primarily of restricted common shares under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements 
the issuance of restricted common shares and the related recognition of non cash compensation expense has no impact on our shareholders equity 
recent industry performance the insurance and reinsurance industry is influenced by factors such as the frequency and or severity of claims and losses  including natural disasters or other catastrophic events  variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in the legal  regulatory and judicial environments  inflationary pressures and general economic conditions 
these factors influence the demand for insurance or reinsurance  the supply of which is generally related to the total capital of competitors in the market 
during  market conditions had been improving primarily as a result of declining insurance capacity 
the events of september th and deteriorating underwriting results of the industry accelerated these already improving conditions 
in general  operating conditions continued to improve during in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
this improvement reflects losses arising from the events of september th  as well as recognition that intense competition in the late s led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms  conditions and coverages 
such industry developments resulted in impaired financial results and erosion of the industry capital base 
additionally  many established insurers and reinsurers have exited key markets 
these developments have provided relatively new insurers and reinsurers  like us  with an opportunity to provide needed underwriting capacity at what we believe to be attractive rates in conjunction with improved terms and conditions 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make many estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities including reserves  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  insurance and other reserves  reinsurance recoverables  investment valuations  intangible assets  bad debts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  where possible  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments for a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  like our company  are even more difficult to make than those made in a mature company since very limited historical information has been reported to us through december  actual results will differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we are required by applicable insurance laws and regulations and gaap to establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the business we underwrite 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses for insured or reinsured claims which have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
insurance loss reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability may extend many years into the future 
during this period  additional facts and trends will become known and  as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted in the period in which the new information becomes known 
while reserves are established based upon available information  certain factors  such as those inherent in the political  judicial and legal system  including judicial and litigation trends and legislation changes  could impact the ultimate liability 
changes to our prior year loss reserves can impact our current underwriting results by reducing our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant 
the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred  and it is likely that the ultimate liability may exceed or be less than such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance and reinsurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of appropriate loss reserves 
even actuarially sound methods can lead to subsequent adjustments to loss reserves that are both significant and irregular due to the nature of the risks written  potentially by a material amount 
for reinsurance assumed  case reserves are based on reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our estimates of reserves for which ceding company reports have not been received 
for our insurance operations  generally  claims personnel determine whether to establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate settlement of individual claims 
the estimate reflects the judgment of claims personnel based on general corporate reserving practices and the experience and knowledge of such personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim and  where appropriate  advice of counsel 
our insurance operations also contract with a number of outside third party administrators in the claims process who  in certain cases  have limited authority to establish case reserves 
the work of such administrators is reviewed and monitored by our claims personnel 
reserves are also established to provide for the estimated expense of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process 
periodically  adjustments to the reported or case reserves may be made as additional information regarding the claims is reported or payments are made 
in accordance with industry practice  we also maintain ibnr reserves 
such reserves are established to provide for incurred claims which have not yet been reported to an insurer or reinsurer as well as to actuarially adjust for any projected variance in case reserving 
even though most insurance policies have policy limits  the nature of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance is such that losses can exceed policy limits for a variety of reasons and could very significantly exceed the premiums received on the underlying policies 
we attempt to limit our risk of loss through reinsurance and may also use retrocessional arrangements 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
see note  significant accounting policies reinsurance ceded  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  we have made various assumptions relating to the pricing of our reinsurance contracts and insurance policies and have also considered available historical industry experience and current industry conditions 
our reserving method for was primarily the expected loss method  which is commonly applied when limited loss experience exists 
we select the initial expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios based on information derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business 
these ratios consider  among other things  rate increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
our reserving process reflects that there is a possibility that the assumptions made could prove to be inaccurate due to several factors  including the fact that very limited historical information has been reported to us through december  due to our start up nature 
as of december   of our total net loss reserves  or million  were ibnr reserves 
a change in the ibnr reserves would result in an approximately million change in our total net loss reserves 
such change would represent approximately of our net income  or approximately per diluted share  and of our december  shareholders equity 
as actual loss information is reported to us and we develop our own loss experience  our reserving methods will also include other actuarial techniques 
it is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a particular period or our financial condition in general 
under gaap  we are only permitted to establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for losses that have occurred on or before the financial statement date 
case reserves and ibnr reserves contemplate these obligations 
no contingency reserve allowances are established to account for future loss occurrences 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the losses are incurred and could be substantial 
premium revenues and related expenses insurance premiums written are recorded at the policy inception and are earned ratably in accordance with the terms of the policies 
unearned premium reserves represent the portion of such premiums written that relates to the unexpired terms of insurance policies in force 
reinsurance premiums written include amounts reported by the ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of premiums for which ceding company reports have not been received 
premiums on our excess of loss and pro rata reinsurance contracts are estimated when the business is underwritten 
for excess of loss contracts  the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  is generally recorded as an estimate of premiums written as of the date of the treaty 
estimates of premiums written under pro rata contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by the brokers and the ceding companies 
for multi year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments  only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy 
the remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi year term 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates  and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and such adjustments could directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
a significant portion of amounts included as premiums receivable  which represent estimated premiums written  net of commissions  is not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts 
reinsurance premiums assumed are earned generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies or reinsurance contracts 
contracts and policies written on a losses occurring basis cover losses which occur during the term of the contract or policy  which typically extends months 
accordingly  the premium is reflected as earned evenly over the term 
pro rata contracts  which are written on a risks attaching basis  cover losses which attach to the underlying insurance policies written during the terms of such pro rata contracts 
premiums earned on a risks attaching basis usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract  typically resulting in recognition of premiums earned over a month period 
certain of our reinsurance contracts include provisions that adjust premiums or acquisition expenses based upon the experience under the contracts 
premiums written and earned  as well as related acquisition expenses under those contracts  are recorded based upon the projected experience under these contracts 
we also write certain business that is intended to provide insurers with risk management solutions that complement traditional reinsurance 
under these contracts  we assume a measured amount of insurance risk in exchange for a specified margin 
the terms and conditions of these contracts may include additional or return premiums based on loss experience  loss corridors  sublimits and caps 
examples of such business include aggregate stop loss coverages and financial quota share coverages 
certain reinsurance contracts included in our non traditional business  which pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  are deemed  for financial reporting purposes  not to transfer insurance risk  are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in statement of position  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk 
for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in our underwriting results 
for those contracts that do not transfer an element of underwriting risk  the estimated profit is reflected in earnings over the estimated settlement period using the interest method and such profit is included in investment income 
under gaap  acquisition expenses and other expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business in our underwriting operations are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
under statutory accounting principles  underwriting expenses are recognized immediately as premiums are written 
acquisition expenses consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses 
other operating expenses also include expenses that vary with  and are directly related to  the acquisition of business 
acquisition expenses are reflected net of ceding commissions received from unaffiliated reinsurers 
deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value based on the related unearned premiums and take into account anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses  based on historical and current experience  and anticipated investment income 
collection of insurance related balances we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance ceded because the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure 
if the financial condition of our reinsurers or retrocessionaires deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we will provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from such parties  as appropriate 
we are also subject to credit risk from our alternative market products  such as rent a captive risk sharing programs  which allow a client to retain a significant portion of its loss exposure without the administrative costs and capital commitment required to establish and operate its own captive 
in certain of these programs  we participate in the operating results by providing excess reinsurance coverage and earn commissions and management fees 
in addition  we write program business on a risk sharing basis with managing general agents or brokers  which may be structured with commissions which are contingent on the underwriting results of the program 
while we attempt to obtain collateral from such parties in an amount sufficient to guarantee their projected financial obligations to us  there is no guarantee that such collateral will be sufficient to secure their actual ultimate obligations 
we provide for probable losses resulting from our inability to collect amounts due from managing general agents  brokers and other clients 
reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million at december  if of such recoverable balances were deemed uncollectible  such charge would have reduced our net income by approximately million  pre tax  or million  after tax  which represents approximately of net income  or per diluted share 
valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce certain of our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our deferred income tax asset of million at december  is reflected net of a valuation allowance of million 
we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in addition  if we subsequently assessed that the valuation allowance was no longer needed  a benefit would be recorded to income in the period in which such determination was made 
investments we currently classify all of our publicly traded fixed maturity investments  short term investments and equity securities as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value 
the fair value of publicly traded fixed maturity securities and publicly traded equity securities is estimated using quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
short term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of issue 
short term investments include certain cash equivalents which are part of our investment portfolios under the management of external investment managers 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies 
our investments in privately held equity securities  other than those carried under the equity method of accounting  are carried at estimated fair value 
fair value is initially considered to be equal to the cost of such investment until the investment is revalued based on substantive events or other factors which could indicate a diminution or appreciation in value 
we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  for privately held equity investments accounted for under the equity method  and we record our percentage share of the investee company s net income or loss 
see note  significant accounting policies investments  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we periodically review our investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is other than temporary 
if such decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  we would write down the investment to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down would be charged to income as a realized loss 
the new cost basis would not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
stock issued to employees we have adopted the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires the use of option valuation models that we believe were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
accordingly  under apb no 
 compensation expense for stock option grants is recognized only to the extent that the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
in addition  under apb no 
 we do not recognize compensation expense for stock issued to employees under our stock purchase plan 
we suspended the operation of our stock purchase plan in december for restricted shares granted  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value of the shares at the measurement date  which is amortized and charged to income as non cash compensation over the vesting period 
these restricted shares are recorded as outstanding upon issuance regardless of any vesting period 
see results of operations non cash compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit activities when they are incurred  rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we are currently evaluating this standard 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 fin which requires the consolidation of certain entities considered to be variable interest entities vies 
an entity is considered to be a vie when it has equity investors which lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
fin provides certain exceptions to these rules  including qualifying special purpose entities subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
vies created after january  must be consolidated immediately  while vies that existed prior to february  must be consolidated as of july  certain ceding companies may meet the definition of a vie due to the protection provided to the ceding company s equity investors from the absorption of expected losses 
we are currently evaluating this standard 
results of operations comparisons of our results of operations for the three years ended december   and are not relevant due to the significant changes in our business during this period  including our new insurance and reinsurance underwriting initiatives  the significant amount of capital raised by us from november through september and our acquisition activity

underwriting results for the year ended december   underwriting income for our insurance and reinsurance segments was million  which reflected a combined ratio on a gaap basis 
the underwriting results for benefited from better than expected experience on catastrophe related business 
the loss ratio  which was for  was comprised of points of paid losses  points related to case reserves and points related to ibnr reserves  and included points related to prior year reserve development in our insurance segment 
see segment information insurance segment for further discussion 
since most of our business is new  very limited data has been reported to us as of december  as a result  a significant portion of the loss ratio is attributable to the increase in ibnr reserves 
for the year ended december   premiums written  losses incurred and acquisition costs resulted primarily from our insurance subsidiaries which were acquired during the remaining portion of our net income for was generated through our investment activities  offset by other operating expenses 
the corresponding amounts for the year ended december  reflect the results of our prior reinsurance operations  which were sold in may acquisition and other expenses the acquisition expense ratio includes commissions  brokerage  premium taxes and other costs incurred to acquire our insurance and reinsurance business 
this ratio is stated net of commission income on business ceded to reinsurers and is also calculated net of certain policy related fee income 
this ratio for was materially influenced by two factors the mix of insurance and reinsurance business  and the accrual of profit commissions in our reinsurance segment based on the level of claims activity on certain non traditional contracts during  which increased acquisition expenses and reduced incurred losses by an equivalent amount 
other operating expenses include costs incurred in the staffing of our insurance and reinsurance operations and the building of related infrastructure 
our operating expense ratio is expected to decline in due to an expected increase in earned premiums  however  consolidated operating expenses are anticipated to increase in as we continue to build the infrastructure of our insurance operations

provision for loss of escrowed assets in connection with the sale of our prior reinsurance operations in may  we placed million of the purchase price in escrow 
the agreement required that these funds would be held for a period of five years to reimburse folksamerica if certain loss reserves transferred to it in the asset sale became deficient as measured at the end for such five year period or to satisfy certain indemnity claims folksamerica may have had during such period 
in february  we reached a definitive settlement agreement with folksamerica pursuant to which we satisfied all of our obligations under the escrow agreement for an amount equal to approximately million  plus accrued interest income of million 
in connection with this settlement agreement  for  we recorded a million benefit to reflect the net effects of this agreement 
during  our net loss included a million charge related to the escrowed assets 
see note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
net investment income at december   approximately of our invested assets consisted of fixed maturity and short term investments  compared to at december   exclusive of securities held in escrow 
net investment income was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
such amounts are net of investment expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
the net investment expenses were offset by advisory fee income that we received from a former investment advisor in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the advisory agreement under which we earned such fee income was terminated in the substantial increase in net investment income in was due to the significant increase in our invested assets resulting from the capital raised in november  cash flow from operations and proceeds received from the public offering of our common shares in april and the exercise of class a warrants in september the decrease in net investment income in compared with primarily reflects the decline in our average invested asset base resulting from the sale of our prior reinsurance operations 
our investment yields were as follows years ended december  pre tax net of tax these yields were calculated based on the amortized cost of the portfolio 
at december   our investment portfolio primarily consisted of short duration  high quality fixed maturities and short term investments  and is managed on a total return basis 
yields on future investment income may vary based on economic conditions  investment allocation decisions and other factors 
the decline in yields in is primarily due to a reduction in the level of yields available in the financial markets 
other expenses and other fee income other expenses primarily represent certain holding company costs necessary to support our growing worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
in addition  other expenses and fee income include the results of hales company inc income taxes acgl changed its legal domicile from the united states to bermuda in november under current bermuda law  we are not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
we have received a written undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of that in the event legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing tax computed on profits  income  gain or appreciation on any capital asset  or tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  such tax will not be applicable to us or our operations until march  acgl will be subject to us federal income tax only to the extent that it derives us source income that is subject to us withholding tax or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the us and is not exempt from us tax under an applicable income tax treaty 
acgl will be subject to a withholding tax on dividends from us investments and interest from certain us taxpayers 
acgl does not consider itself to be engaged in a trade or business within the us and  consequently  does not expect to be subject to direct us income taxation 
however  because there is uncertainty as to the activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  there can be no assurances that the us internal revenue service will not contend successfully that acgl or its non us subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if acgl or any of its non us subsidiaries were subject to us income tax  acgl s shareholders equity and earnings could be materially adversely affected 
acgl s us subsidiaries are subject to us income taxes on their worldwide income

our weighted average statutory tax rate for the years ended december  and of and  respectively  has been calculated by using the pre tax income loss in each jurisdiction multiplied by that jurisdiction s applicable statutory tax rate 
the and income tax provisions resulted in effective tax rates of and  respectively  excluding the effect of changes in our valuation allowance in the amount of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year consistent with the relative mix of income reported by jurisdictions due primarily to the varying tax rates in each jurisdiction 
the effective tax rate  excluding the effect of certain non cash compensation  net realized investment gains or losses  net foreign exchange gains or losses and other income  was approximately 
we currently estimate that our comparable income tax provision in will result in an effective tax rate of approximately  although no assurances can be given to that effect 
see note  income taxes  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average statutory tax rate for the years ended december   and at december   we have a valuation allowance of million against a deferred tax asset in one of our subsidiaries that currently does not have a business plan to produce significant future taxable income

the effect of financial market movements on the investment portfolio will directly impact net realized gains and losses as the portfolio is adjusted and rebalanced 
the net realized losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  on our fixed income portfolio resulted from the sale of certain securities to reduce credit exposure  and from sales related to rebalancing the portfolio 
in  net realized gains included million of pre tax losses  or million  after tax  recorded during the fourth quarter resulting from the restructuring of our investment portfolio in connection with our redomestication to bermuda on november  net foreign exchange gains or losses we underwrite risks on a worldwide basis 
at december   approximately of our aggregate net premiums written are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  of  consisted of an unrealized loss of  and a realized gain of  the net unrealized loss resulted from the translation of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities at december   as defined and required under gaap 
foreign exchange gains and losses vary with fluctuations in currency rates 
accordingly  these gains and losses could add significant volatility to our net income in future periods 
we have not attempted  and currently do not expect to attempt  to reduce our exposure to these exchange rate risks by using hedging transactions or by investing in securities denominated in local foreign currencies 
we may therefore suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
other income at december   we held six investments in privately held securities 
three of such investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we record a proportionate share of the investee company s net income or loss based on our ownership percentage  which  for  amounted to million on a pre tax basis and is included in other income 
approximately million of such amount was generated from an investment which was sold in april reversal of  or provision for  deferred tax asset valuation allowance the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was based on our recently completed restructuring of our us based insurance underwriting operations and our business plan 
the tax valuation allowance for the years ended december   and is discussed above under income taxes  and in note  income taxes  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
loss on sale of prior reinsurance operations in connection with the sale of our prior reinsurance operations to folksamerica on may   we recognized an after tax loss  as described in note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
non cash compensation restricted stock during and  we made certain grants primarily of restricted common shares to employees and to robert clements  chairman of our board of directors  under our stock incentive plans and other arrangements 
these grants were made primarily in connection with our underwriting initiative 
after tax non cash compensation expense included in net income for the year ended december  was million  of which million related to certain restricted common shares for which the vesting terms had been accelerated during  as discussed below 
during  our board of directors accelerated the vesting terms of certain restricted common shares granted to mr 
clements  which had been issued in connection with the november capital infusion  and mr 
clements agreed to repay the outstanding million loan previously made to him by us 
mr 
clements was granted  restricted common shares which were initially scheduled to vest in five equal annual amounts commencing on october  the vesting period and the amounts have been changed as follows of the shares vested on october  and the balance of the shares will vest in two equal annual amounts on october  and october  the million loan made by us to mr 
clements was used by him to pay income and self employment taxes 
under his retention agreement  mr 
clements received additional compensation in cash in an amount sufficient to defray the loan s interest costs 
in order to facilitate the repayment of the loan  we agreed to repurchase an amount of mr 
clements shares equal to the principal balance of the loan  less any cash payment made by mr 
clements  for a price per share based on the market price for the common shares as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of sale 
in addition  we agreed to make gross up payments to mr 
clements in the event of certain tax liabilities in connection with the repurchase 
pursuant to such arrangements  we repurchased  common shares from mr 
clements for an aggregate purchase price of million 
mr 
clements used all of such sale proceeds and million in cash to repay the entire loan balance on november  following such share repurchase  our book value per diluted share decreased by approximately per share 
during the loan period  compensation to mr 
clements under his retention agreement included payments of  from us  of which  was used by him to pay interest on the loan and the balance was used to pay his related income tax liabilities 
stock options as discussed above under the caption critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements stock issued to employees  we have elected to continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
and have provided the required additional pro forma disclosures 
such pro forma information has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
the fair value of employee stock options has been estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
see note  significant accounting policies stock options  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
for purposes of the required pro forma information  the estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period 
the weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our net income loss per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below  however  the expensing of stock options would have had no impact on our shareholders equity 
years ended december  in thousands except share data net income loss  as reported    total stock based employee compensation expense under fair value method  net of tax    pro forma net income loss    earnings loss per share basic as reported pro forma earnings loss per share diluted as reported pro forma the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
as our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  we believe that the existing option valuation models  such as the black scholes model  may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
the effects of applying sfas no 
as shown in the pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on reported net income for future years 
extraordinary gain on november   we acquired psic  a non standard automobile insurer  for million 
for the year ended december   we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  or per share  from this acquisition 
the extraordinary gain represented the excess of the fair value of acquired net assets of million over the purchase price of million 
psic is included in our insurance segment 
segment information we classify our businesses into two underwriting segments  reinsurance and insurance 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  requires certain disclosures about operating segments in a manner that is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the segment 
for a description of our underwriting segments  refer to note  segment information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
segment performance is evaluated primarily based on underwriting income or loss 
due to the significant changes in our business during the years  and  we believe that comparisons of the results of operations of our business segments are not relevant 
during the year ended december   we had only one reportable operating segment insurance 
during  the insurance operating segment generated revenues of million and net income of million 
the remaining portion of our net income was generated through our investment activities  offset by other operating expenses 
in addition  during we produced our business through general agents and managing general agents  none of which accounted for more than of total gross premiums written 
during the year ended december   due to the sale of our prior reinsurance operations to folksamerica in may  segment information is not meaningful

the components of the reinsurance segment s underwriting gain are discussed below 
premiums written 
net premiums written for the year ended december  were million 
of such amount  of net premiums written were generated from pro rata contracts and were derived from excess of loss treaties 
we are currently retaining substantially all of our reinsurance premiums written 
we do  however  participate in common account retrocessional arrangements for certain treaties 
such arrangements reduce the effect of individual or aggregate losses to all companies participating on such treaties  including the reinsurer  such as us  and the ceding company 
we will continue to evaluate our retrocessional requirements

certain reinsurance contracts included in our non traditional business are deemed  for financial reporting purposes  not to transfer insurance risk  and are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting 
for those contracts that contain an element of underwriting risk  the expected estimated profit margin is deferred and amortized over the contract period and such amount is included in our underwriting results 
we recorded million on such contracts for the year ended december  in our underwriting results and  on a notional basis  the amount of premiums attaching to such contracts was million 
for those contracts that do not transfer an element of underwriting risk  the expected profit is reflected in earnings over the estimated settlement period using the interest method and such profit is included in investment income 
we did not record any contracts using the interest method for the year ended december  the reinsurance segment commenced operations with the january  renewal season 
as a result  premiums written for the segment reflect only new business 
given this fact and current market conditions  we currently anticipate significant premium growth in  although no assurances can be given to that effect 
the amount of premiums written with respect to our various lines of business may fluctuate from year to year based on many factors  including changing market conditions 
net premiums earned 
for  approximately of the reinsurance segment s net premiums written were earned 
due to the significant growth in premiums written during  there is a significant difference between written and earned premiums for such year 
of net premiums earned in  were generated from pro rata contracts and were derived from excess of loss treaties 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reinsurance segment losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the year ended december  were million 
the loss ratio included points of paid claims  points related to case reserves and points related to ibnr reserves 
for a discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  please refer to the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
underwriting expenses 
for the year ended december   reinsurance segment acquisition expenses were of net premiums earned 
the acquisition expense ratio for was influenced by three factors our mix of excess of loss business compared to pro rata business  which is typically written at a higher expense ratio and lower loss ratio than excess of loss business  the accrual of profit commissions based on the level of claims activity on certain non traditional contracts during  which increased acquisition expenses and decreased losses and loss adjustment expenses by an equivalent amount  and the effect of a million payment to terminate a non competition covenant  as described in note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses were of net premiums earned 
since the staffing and infrastructure building of the reinsurance segment has been substantially completed  the anticipated operating expense ratio for currently is expected to be stable  given current market conditions  although no assurances can be given to that effect 
insurance segment the following table sets forth our insurance segment s underwriting results for the year ended december  in thousands operating information gross premiums written  net premiums written  net premiums earned policy related fee income  losses and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition expenses  operating expenses  gaap underwriting loss  statutory basis loss ratio acquisition expense ratio other operating expense ratio combined ratio gaap basis loss ratio acquisition expense ratio other operating expense ratio combined ratio the loss ratios for statutory and gaap are based on net premiums earned 
the statutory expense ratios are based on net premiums written  while the gaap expense ratios are based on net premiums earned 
the acquisition expense ratio reflects acquisition expenses net of policy related fee income 
underwriting loss 
for the year ended december   the combined ratio on a gaap basis for the insurance segment was  which included points related to development of prior year reserves in our non standard automobile and program business 
our total combined statutory ratio for was 
in calculating expenses incurred under gaap  only a portion of operating expenses are deferred 
accordingly  when premiums are growing rapidly  the gaap expense ratio will be higher than the statutory expense ratio 
with respect to businesses in a start up phase  like us  the statutory expense ratio generally provides a more accurate indication of a company s cost of producing business 
the components of the insurance segment s underwriting loss are discussed below 
premiums written 
during  our insurance segment began staffing its specialty operations and established new profit centers in various specialty lines  which significantly contributed to revenues in the latter half of the year 
accordingly  gross premiums written and net premiums written in increased significantly over levels to million and million  respectively 
in addition  in our program business  we substantially reduced the amount of premiums ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers and added a significant number of new programs 
we currently expect that premiums written in the insurance segment will continue to increase substantially in  although no assurance can be given to that effect 
set forth below is summary information regarding the insurance segment s net premiums written and earned by major line of business for the year ended december  net premiums written of total net premiums earned of total in thousands major line of business casualty   programs   property   executive assurance   healthcare   professional liability   other   total   for information regarding net premiums written produced by geographic location for the insurance segment for the year ended december   refer to note  segment information  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
net premiums earned 
for  approximately of the insurance segment net premiums written were earned 
due to the significant growth in premiums written during  there is a significant difference between written and earned premiums for such year 
policy related fee income 
policy related fee income  such as billing  cancellation and reinstatement fees  is primarily recognized as earned when substantially all of the related services have been provided 
policy related fee income will vary in the future related to such activity and is earned primarily in our non standard automobile business 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
insurance segment losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for were million 
the loss ratio included points of paid claims of which points were generated from our non standard automobile business  points related to case reserves and points related to ibnr reserves 
our reported loss ratio reflects a point  or million  deficiency in our reported reserves 
approximately of this deficiency occurred in a small number of program accounts written during and and the balance of was in our non standard automobile business as a result of an actuarial review performed in for a discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  please refer to the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
underwriting expenses 
the acquisition expense ratio for our insurance segment of was calculated net of certain policy related fee income which reduced the ratio by approximately points  and was influenced by  among other things the amount of business ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers and the amount of business written on a surplus lines non admitted basis 
the combination of these two factors resulted in a significant reduction in our acquisition expense ratio for other operating expenses for were of net premiums earned  and reflected the start up nature of the insurance segment 
we currently expect that operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to build our insurance group s infrastructure 
however  as a percentage of net premiums earned  operating expenses are currently expected to decline in since net premiums earned are expected to grow significantly  although no assurances can be given to that effect 
in building our insurance segment s infrastructure  we capitalized certain software development costs 
at december   approximately million of such costs were capitalized and will be amortized over the software s useful life 
liquidity and capital resources acgl is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the shares in its subsidiaries 
generally  we depend on our available cash resources  liquid investments and dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries to make payments  including the payment of operating expenses we may incur and for any dividends our board of directors may determine 
acgl does not currently intend to declare any dividends 
pursuant to a shareholders agreement that we entered into in connection with the november capital infusion  we have agreed not to declare any dividend or make any other distribution on our common shares  and not to repurchase any common shares  until we have repurchased from the warburg pincus funds  the hellman friedman funds and the other holders of our preference shares  pro rata  on the basis of the amount of each of these shareholders investment in us at the time of such repurchase  preference shares having an aggregate value of million  at a per share price acceptable to these shareholders 
during  acgl contributed its ownership interest in arch us and the us insurance and reinsurance group to arch re bermuda  which increased arch re bermuda s surplus to approximately billion as of december  in addition  our us group was restructured in april such that arch re us has become the parent of our principal us insurance subsidiaries  arch insurance  arch specialty and arch e s 
at december   arch re us s statutory capital and surplus was approximately million 
on a consolidated basis  our aggregate invested assets  including cash and short term investments  totaled approximately billion at december  as of such date  and following such restructurings  acgl s readily available cash  short term investments and marketable securities  excluding amounts held by our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  totaled million 
the ability of our regulated insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions is dependent on their ability to meet applicable regulatory standards 
under bermuda law  arch re bermuda is required to maintain a minimum solvency margin ie  the amount by which the value of its general business assets must exceed its general business liabilities equal to the greatest of  of net premiums written being gross premiums written by us less any premiums ceded by us  but we may not deduct more than of gross premiums when computing net premiums written and of loss and other insurance reserves 
arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during any financial year if it is not in compliance with its minimum solvency margin 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year s statutory balance sheet unless it files  at least seven days before payment of such dividends  with the bermuda monetary authority an affidavit stating that it will continue to meet the required margins 
in addition  arch re bermuda is prohibited  without prior approval of the bermuda monetary authority  from reducing by or more its total statutory capital  as set out in its previous year s financial statements 
at december   arch re bermuda had statutory capital and surplus as determined under bermuda law of billion including ownership interests in its wholly owned subsidiaries 
accordingly  as of december   of arch re bermuda s capital  or approximately million  is available for dividends without prior approval under bermuda law  as discussed above 
as of december   our us insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  on a consolidated basis  may not pay any significant dividends or distributions during without prior regulatory approval 
in addition  the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could be constrained by our dependence on financial strength ratings from independent rating agencies 
our ratings from these agencies depend to a large extent on the capitalization levels of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
acgl  through its subsidiaries  provides financial support to certain of its insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  through certain reinsurance arrangements essential to the ratings of such subsidiaries 
except as described in the preceding sentence  or where express reinsurance  guarantee or other financial support contractual arrangements are in place  each of acgl s subsidiaries or affiliates is solely responsible for its own liabilities and commitments and no other acgl subsidiary or affiliate is so responsible 
any reinsurance arrangements  guarantees or other financial support contractual arrangements that are in place are solely for the benefit of the acgl subsidiary or affiliate involved and third parties creditors or insureds of such entity are not express beneficiaries of such arrangements 
cash flow from operating activities on a consolidated basis are provided by premiums collected  fee income  investment income and collected reinsurance recoverables  offset by losses and loss adjustment expense payments  reinsurance premiums payable and operating costs 
consolidated cash provided by used for operating activities for the years ended december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
our expanded underwriting activities will initially be supported by our capital  and we expect that our other operational needs for the foreseeable future will be met by our balance of cash and short term investments  as well as by funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income and proceeds on the sale or maturity of our investments 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
it permits us to issue various types of securities  including unsecured debt securities  preference shares and common shares  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million 
during april  we issued  of our common shares and received net proceeds of approximately million  net of transaction costs 
the net proceeds of the offering were principally used to increase the surplus of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
the unused portion of our shelf registration is approximately million following the offering in april any additional issuance of common shares by us could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and our book value per share 
from august to september  an aggregate of  common shares were issued upon the exercise of all  outstanding class a warrants  which were exercisable for per share and were scheduled to expire on september  the proceeds from the exercise of class a warrants on a cash basis increased shareholders equity by approximately million 
in october  acgl contributed such proceeds to arch re bermuda 
at december  and december   our consolidated shareholders equity was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
the substantial increase in consolidated shareholders equity was primarily attributable to the effects of operating income for the year ended december   proceeds received by us from the issuance of common shares in the stock offering in april and the exercise of class a warrants in september and an increase in unrealized appreciation of investments 
certain matters which may materially affect our results of operations and or financial condition reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections  at a given point in time  of our expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of losses incurred 
estimating loss reserves is inherently difficult  which is exacerbated by the fact that we are a new company with relatively no historical experience upon which to base such estimates 
we utilize actuarial models as well as available historical insurance industry loss ratio experience and loss development patterns to assist in the establishment of appropriate loss reserves 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid will deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
see the section above entitled critical accounting policies  estimates and recent accounting pronouncements reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
reinsurance protection and recoverables for purposes of limiting our risk of loss  we reinsure a portion of our exposures  paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums received on the policies we write  and we may also use retrocessional protection 
for the year ended december   ceded premiums written represented approximately of gross premiums written 
in our insurance segment  we retained a greater amount of premiums written in our program business in as compared to as a result of the new underwriting initiative and our improved financial position 
the development of loss reserves  on a gross basis  from and prior years in our program business in the amount of million substantially increased our amounts recoverable from reinsurers in the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
currently  the market for these arrangements is experiencing high demand for various products and it is not certain that we will be able to obtain adequate protection at cost effective levels 
as a result of such market conditions and other factors  we may not be able to successfully mitigate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
further  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers and retrocessionaires because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires does not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our existing reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place coverages only with substantial  financially sound carriers 
at december   approximately of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses of million not including prepaid reinsurance premiums were due from carriers which had an am best rating of a or better 
we had no amounts recoverable on unpaid losses from a single entity or group of entities that exceeded of our total shareholders equity 
the following table details our reinsurance recoverables at december  of total best am rating sentry insurance a mutual company a lloyd s of london syndicates a hartford fire insurance company a swiss reinsurance america corporation a folksamerica reinsurance company a alternative market recoverables nr gmac insurance group a odyssey reinsurance corporation a ge reinsurance corporation a axa corporate solutions reinsurance company b st 
paul fire marine insurance company a gerling global reinsurance corporation of america nr pma capital insurance company a lumbermens mutual casualty company b trenwick america reinsurance corporation c commercial risk re insurance company b all other total the financial strength ratings are as of march  and were assigned by am best based on its opinion of the insurer s financial strength as of such date 
an explanation of the ratings listed in the table follows ratings of a and a are designated superior  the a and a ratings are designated excellent  the b rating is designated very good  the b rating is designated fair  and the c rating is designated weak 
additionally  am best has five classifications within the not rated or nr category 
reasons for an nr rating being assigned by am best include insufficient data  size or operating experience  companies which are in run off with no active business writings or dormant  companies which disagree with their rating and request that a rating not be published or insurers that request not to be formally evaluated for the purposes of assigning a rating opinion 
in connection with our acquisition of arch specialty in february  the seller  sentry insurance a mutual company sentry  agreed to reinsure or otherwise assume all liabilities arising out of arch specialty s business prior to the closing of the acquisition 
the balance due from sentry includes all such amounts 
the am best group rating of a excellent has been applied to all lloyd s of london syndicates 
includes amounts recoverable from separate cell accounts in our alternative markets unit 
approximately of such amounts are collateralized with letters of credit or deposit funds 
the following table provides a breakdown of the all other category by am best rating of total companies rated a or better companies not rated total natural and man made catastrophic events we have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including  but not limited to  hurricanes  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  and severe winter weather and fires 
catastrophes can also cause losses in non property lines of business such as workers compensation or general liability 
in addition to the nature of property business  we believe that economic and geographic trends affecting insured property  including inflation  property value appreciation and geographic concentration tend to generally increase the size of losses from catastrophic events over time 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected  large losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of such events with statistical certainty or estimate the amount of loss any given occurrence will generate 
it is not possible to eliminate completely our exposure to unforecasted or unpredictable events and  to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
therefore  claims for natural and man made catastrophic events could expose us to large losses and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations  which could cause the value of our common shares to fluctuate widely 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  we may not be successful in doing so 
moreover  irrespective of the clarity and inclusiveness of policy language  there can be no assurance that a result oriented court or arbitration panel favoring the insured or ceding company will enforce the language as written  such a tribunal may adopt a strained interpretation of the policy language  invoke public policy to limit enforceability of policy language  ignore policy language  make factual findings unwarranted by the evidence or otherwise seek to justify a ruling adverse to us 
for our catastrophe exposed business  we seek to limit the amount of exposure we will assume from any one insured or reinsured and the amount of the exposure to catastrophe losses in any geographic zone 
we monitor our exposure to catastrophic events  including earthquake  wind and specific terrorism exposures  and periodically reevaluate the estimated probable maximum pre tax loss for such exposures 
our estimated probable maximum pre tax loss is determined through the use of modeling techniques  but such estimate does not represent our total potential loss for such exposures 
we seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a percentage of our total shareholders equity for severe catastrophic events 
currently  we generally seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to approximately of total shareholders equity for severe catastrophic events that could be expected to occur once in every years 
there can be no assurances that we will not suffer pre tax losses greater than of our total shareholders equity from a catastrophic event due to several factors  including the inherent uncertainties in estimating the frequency and severity of such events and the margin of error in making such determinations resulting from potential inaccuracies in the data provided by clients and brokers  the modeling techniques and the application of such techniques 
in addition  depending on business opportunities and the mix of business that may comprise our insurance and reinsurance portfolio  we may seek to limit the probable maximum pre tax loss to a higher percentage of our total shareholders equity for our catastrophe exposed business 
for exposures  our insurance operations have entered into a reinsurance treaty which provides coverage for catastrophe related losses equal to of the first million in excess of a million retention of such losses 
in the future  we may seek to purchase additional catastrophe or other reinsurance protection 
the availability and cost of such reinsurance protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
as a result of market conditions and other factors  we may not be successful in obtaining such protection 
see reinsurance protection and recoverables above 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation we write business on a worldwide basis  and our results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the value of currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates can reduce our revenues and increase our liabilities and costs  as measured in the us dollar as our functional currency 
we have not attempted and currently do not expect to attempt to reduce our exposure to these exchange rate risks by using hedging transactions or by investing in securities denominated in local foreign currencies 
we may therefore suffer losses solely as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
management and operations as a relatively new insurance and reinsurance company  our success will depend on our ability to integrate new management and operating personnel and to establish and maintain operating procedures and internal controls including the timely and successful implementation of our information technology initiatives to effectively support our business and our regulatory and reporting requirements  and no assurances can be given as to the success of these endeavors 
shareholders agreement the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds together control a majority of our voting power on a fully diluted basis and have the right to nominate a majority of directors to our board under the shareholders agreement entered into in connection with the november capital infusion 
the shareholders agreement also provides that we cannot engage in certain transactions  including mergers and acquisitions and transactions in excess of certain amounts  without the consent of a designee of the warburg pincus funds and a designee of the hellman friedman funds 
these provisions could have an effect on the operation of our business and  to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or could depress the market price of our common shares 
by reason of their ownership and the shareholders agreement  the warburg pincus funds and the hellman friedman funds are able to strongly influence or effectively control actions to be taken by us 
the interests of these shareholders may differ materially from the interests of the holders of our common shares  and these shareholders could take actions that are not in the interests of the holders of our common shares 
contingencies relating to the sale of prior reinsurance operations see note  acquisition of subsidiaries and disposition of prior reinsurance operations  of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
industry and ratings we operate in a highly competitive environment  and since the september  events  new capital has entered the market 
these factors may mitigate the benefits that the financial markets may perceive for the property and casualty insurance industry  and we cannot offer any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our industry or that the intensity of competition in our industry will not erode profitability for insurance and reinsurance companies generally  including us 
in addition  we can offer no assurances that we will participate at all or to the same extent as more established or other companies in any price increases or increased profitability in our industry 
if we do not share in such price increases or increased profitability  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
financial strength and claims paying ratings from third party rating agencies are instrumental in establishing the competitive positions of companies in our industry 
periodically  rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet their criteria for the ratings assigned to us by them 
our reinsurance subsidiaries  arch re us and arch re bermuda  and our insurance subsidiaries  arch insurance  arch specialty and arch e s  each currently have financial strength ratings of a excellent from am best 
with respect to our non standard automobile insurers  american independent has a financial strength rating of c marginal from am best  and psic has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best 
we do not believe that american independent or psic s non standard automobile business are particularly ratings sensitive because their insureds purchase insurance primarily to satisfy state and local insurance and financial responsibility requirements 
recently  rating agencies have been coming under increasing pressure as a result of high profile corporate bankruptcies and may  as a result  increase their scrutiny of rated companies  revise their rating policies or take other action 
we can offer no assurances that our ratings will remain at their current levels 
a ratings downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  could adversely affect both our relationships with agents  brokers  wholesalers and other distributors of our existing products and services and new sales of our products and services 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   the future minimum rental commitments  exclusive of escalation clauses and maintenance costs and net of rental income  for all of our operating leases with remaining non cancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows in thousands thereafter  all of these leases are for the rental of office space  with expiration terms that range from to rental expense income  net of income from subleases  was approximately million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in april  we established a letter of credit facility for up to million 
the principal purpose of this facility is to issue  as required  evergreen standby letters of credit in favor of primary insurance or reinsurance counterparties with which we have entered into reinsurance arrangements 
such letters of credit when issued are secured by a portion of our investment portfolio 
in addition  the letter of credit facility also requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  which we were in compliance with at december  at such date  we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit which were secured by investments totaling million 
in addition to letters of credit  we have and may establish insurance trust accounts in the us and canada to secure our reinsurance amounts payable as required 
this bank facility expires april  it is anticipated that the letter of credit facility will be renewed on expiry  but such renewals are subject to the availability of credit from banks which we utilize 
in the event such support is insufficient  we could be required to provide alternative security to cedents 
this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources 
the amount of letters of credit issued is driven by  among other things  the timing and payment of catastrophe losses  loss development of existing reserves  the payment pattern of such reserves  the further expansion of our business and the loss experience of such business 
if we are unable to post security in the form of letters of credit or trust funds when required  our operations could be significantly and negatively affected

our privately held equity securities consist of securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
the risk of investing in such securities is generally greater than the risk of investing in securities of widely held  publicly traded companies

restricted common shares are included in the number of common shares outstanding as if such shares were issued on the date of grant

we had agreed to issue to the new investors additional preference shares such that the per share price would be adjusted downward by per preference share when the closing price of our common shares was at least per share for at least out of consecutive trading days on or prior to september   which condition was met on december  each preference share is convertible at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder thereof into one fully paid and nonassessable common share  subject to possible adjustment

represents restricted common shares issued in connection with the november capital infusion transaction 
these restricted common shares are included in common shares at december  pursuant to the subscription agreement  a post closing purchase price adjustment will be calculated in november or such earlier date as agreed upon by us and the investors based on an adjustment basket 
the adjustment basket will be equal to the difference between value realized upon sale and the gaap book value at the closing of the capital infusion in november as adjusted based on a pre determined growth rate of agreed upon non core businesses  plus the difference between gaap net book value of the insurance balances attributable to our core insurance operations with respect to any policy or contract written or having an effective date prior to november  at the time of the final adjustment and those balances at the closing  minus reductions in book value arising from costs and expenses relating to the transaction provided under the subscription agreement  actual losses arising out of breach of representations under the subscription agreement and certain other costs and expenses 
if the adjustment basket  which will be calculated by our independent auditors  is less than zero  we will issue additional preference shares to the investors based on the decrease in value of the components of the adjustment basket 
if the adjustment basket is greater than zero  we are allowed to use cash in an amount based on the increase in value of the components of the adjustment basket to repurchase common shares other than any common shares issued upon conversion of the preference shares or exercise of the class a warrants 
in addition  on the fourth anniversary of the closing  there will be a calculation of a further adjustment basket based on liabilities owed to folksamerica if any under the asset purchase agreement  dated as of january   between us and folksamerica  and specified tax and erisa matters under the subscription agreement 
for a more detailed description of these adjustment provisions  see our company risk factors risks relating to our company we may be required to issue additional preference shares to the investors in the november capital infusion as a result of various purchase price adjustments agreed to in connection with it  and the value of our common shares may  therefore  be further diluted 
inflation our ultimate exposure for losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims not yet settled is increased by the effects of inflation  and changes in inflation therefore could be a significant factor in determining the appropriateness of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and our premium rates 
generally  our methods of calculating the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and determining our premium rates take into account the anticipated effects of inflation 
however  until claims are ultimately settled  the full effect of inflation on our results cannot be known 
market sensitive instruments and risk management we are exposed to potential loss from various market risks  including changes in equity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with the sec s financial reporting release no 
 we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments as of december  market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument and consists of several components  including liquidity  basis and price risks 
the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  presents hypothetical losses in cash flows  earnings and fair values of market sensitive instruments which were held by us on december  and are sensitive to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
this risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the following sensitivity analysis represent forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used by us to assess and mitigate risk should not be considered projections of future events of losses 
the focus of the sec s market risk rules is on price risk 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we employ sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures could have on the future earnings  fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the following sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and invested assets  excluding investments carried under the equity method of accounting 
interest rate risk the aggregate hypothetical loss generated from an immediate parallel  adverse shift in the treasury yield curve of basis points would result in a decrease in market value of approximately million on our fixed income portfolio  including short term investments  as of december   and would decrease diluted book value per share by approximately as of such date 
equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risks on the private equity securities included in our investment portfolio 
all of our privately held securities were issued by insurance and reinsurance companies or companies providing services to the insurance industry 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
investments included in our private portfolio include securities issued by privately held companies that are generally restricted as to resale or are otherwise illiquid and do not have readily ascertainable market values 
investments in privately held securities issued by privately held companies may include both equity securities and securities convertible into  or exercisable for  equity securities some of which may have fixed maturities 
our privately held equity securities  which at december  were carried at a fair value of million  have exposure to price risk 
the estimated potential losses in fair value for our privately held equity portfolio resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted market prices  dealer quotes or fair value is approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value  income  and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation of the us dollar against other currencies under our outstanding contracts at december  would have resulted in approximately million of unrealized losses
