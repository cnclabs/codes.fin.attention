item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands revenues    operating earnings loss    depreciation    marketing segment operating statistics were as follows wellhead purchases per day crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mmbtus  mmbtus  mmbtus average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties by the company at the lease level and pipeline pooling points 
gross revenues for the marketing division decreased by billion for and by billion for relative to the preceding year 
this trend was initiated in early when management concluded the company s scope of operations exceeded its capital base of support 
as a result of rapid growth  the company was having difficulty maintaining credit support for its expanded level of business 
thus  management began implementing steps to reduce the volume of purchases  both at the wellhead level and at major trade points 
the initial effort commenced in may  when the company entered into a joint venture arrangement with a third party for the purpose of purchasing  distributing and marketing crude oil in the offshore gulf of mexico region 
the intent behind the joint venture was to combine the company s marketing expertise with stronger financial and credit support from the co venture participant 
the venture operated as williams gulfmark energy company pursuant to the terms of a joint venture agreement 
the company held a percent interest in the net earnings of the venture and accounted for its interest under the equity method of accounting 
formation of the joint venture and the company s associated withdrawal from direct purchases of crude oil in offshore waters was the cause of the reduction in gross revenues 
in october  management undertook additional steps to reduce the scope of operations by i selling its onshore texas crude oil pipeline and implementing a related withdrawal from a six county area and ii withdrawing from the williams gulfmark joint venture pursuant to the terms of a dissolution agreement 
this resulted in the company having no further interest in the offshore crude oil ii marketplace 
the strategy to reduce operations proved to be fortuitous because of the december enron bankruptcy 
this event had a significant effect on the crude oil and natural gas industries  as credit support for operations became of paramount importance 
numerous industry participants  including the company s former joint venture partner  either left or are in the process of withdrawing from the crude oil and natural gas marketplace 
spurred by the fallout from the enron bankruptcy  the contraction in volumes and revenues continued during in response  the company concentrated its crude oil operation in its areas of strength  central and south texas  the onshore gulf coast of louisiana as well as michigan and the los angeles basin area of california 
management believes the contraction of volumes has stabilized at present levels 
while volume growth is not anticipated for  management believes that profitability can be maintained within the present  more manageable level of activity 
operating earnings varied from million in to a million loss in and then returned to profitability of million for except for the impact on inventory carrying values  operating earnings tend to be a function of the trend in prices for prompt or current month deliveries as opposed to average price received in a reporting period 
during  the crude oil and natural gas prompt month price bias was trending up or generally strengthening 
with the high volume of activity at the time  the company s marketing operation produced a record profit 
market conditions reversed in and prompt month prices became exceptionally weak and normal margins narrowed 
further  due to declining crude oil prices that were accelerated by the events of september   the company recognized approximately million in charges related to crude oil inventory liquidations and valuation write downs 
operating earnings for were also adversely impacted by a million bad debt provision resulting from the enron bankruptcy 
these items were partially offset by a million gain recognized in upon the sale of a crude oil pipeline 
for  market conditions for crude oil reversed again with prices trending upward due to iraqi war fears and production problems in venezuela 
this caused a significant prompt month premium and led to increased margins 
with respect to inventory values  domestic crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range at year end to the range by year end as part of the company s strategy to reduce its exposure to price fluctuation  during the first quarter of  the company chose to liquidate lower priced inventory into a relatively high value market which increased operating margins by million 
going into  prices have remained strong and as of december   the company held approximately  barrels of crude oil inventory valued at approximately per barrel 
of particular significant effect on operating earnings was the earning of fee income totaling  during the first six months of this fee originated pursuant to the terms of the agreement to dissolve the williams gulfmark joint venture 
effective with november business  the company began to earn fees approximating  per month based on the quantity of crude oil being purchased by the former co venture participant in the offshore gulf of mexico region 
unfortunately  effective with july business  credit constraints caused the former venture participant to substantially curtail and ultimately cease its purchases of the crude oil in the region 
as a result  the company recorded no fee income during the remainder of and no such fee is anticipated in future periods 
the company and the co venture participant continue to cooperate in the final wind down and settlement of open trade account items 
as of december  the venture s remaining trade accounts due totaled approximately million and trade accounts payable totaled approximately million 
as the venture either collects or funds cash proceeds in settlement of such accounts  the company will receive or pay its pro rata percent share of such cash proceeds or requirements

ii transportation the transportation segment continued to face a generally stagnant marketplace in  as has been the situation since the second quarter of revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount revenues    operating earnings    depreciation    represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
results from the transportation segment are closely tied to trends for the united states economy in general and more specifically  to the domestic petrochemical industry 
as a common carrier transporter of bulk liquid chemicals  demand for the company s services is closely tied to the economic activity of domestic manufacturers of petrochemicals 
a weakened us economy  a relatively strong dollar that reduces chemical exports and high natural gas feedstock costs have all served to suppress demand in recent years 
based on its current infrastructures  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency and earnings at a level of revenues approaching million per year 
when profitable demand is short of designed capacity  earnings are reduced and become a function of the current level of demand and the company s ability to control costs 
because of the fixed cost component of operating expenses  operating earnings when expressed as a percentage change will increase or decrease relatively faster than the rate of increase or decrease existing for revenues 
to counter current conditions  the company has attempted to expand market share and focus on cost control 
there have been a limited number of workforce reductions and expenditures on equipment were for replacement items during and the company s efforts to contain cost however  were offset by a million increase in insurance expense for the transportation segment 
in recent years  the tank truck industry has seen a large volume of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions 
given current conditions for the industry  the company anticipates further industry consolidation as less financially secure competitors fail or are acquired 
this should reduce future competition 
when the us economy improves and chemical demand resumes  the company anticipates being well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities 
ii oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts are as follows in thousands revenues    operating earnings loss  depreciation and depletion    production volumes and price information is as follows production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf oil and gas revenues and operating earnings for were reduced primarily because of declining natural gas prices from an average of mcf in to mcf in as between and  improved average natural gas prices were offset by reduced crude oil prices and a slight reduction in natural gas sales volumes 
an additional factor contributing to reduced earnings were dry hole and other exploration expenses totaling  in as compared to  for and  for during  the oil and gas operation participated in the drilling of twenty one gross wells 
thirteen wells were successfully completed with eight dry holes 
in addition  three wells in process at year end were subsequently completed as producers 
year end december  estimated oil and gas reserves of  barrels and  mcf  respectively  reflected an average decrease of three percent from the year end estimate 
estimated future net cash flow before income taxes from oil and gas properties was increased  however  from  at year end to  at year end this increase resulted from current price improvements  most notably natural gas which was valued at per unit for the year end reserve estimate versus per unit for the year end reserve valuation 
one of the successful wells drilled in was on the eagle lake prospect in wharton county  texas 
this well is currently producing approximately  mcf of natural gas and barrels of crude oil per day with the company holding a percent working interest 
the company also resumed activity in the austin chalk trend of central texas participating in the successful re entry of one well that is currently producing approximately mcf of natural gas and barrels of crude oil per day 
the company holds a nine percent working interest in the austin chalk well and a second well on this same unit was successfully drilled in a total of ten austin chalk wells are budgeted for ii in the elm grove field of bossier parish  louisiana  development efforts also continued 
three wells were successfully drilled and completed in with four wells anticipated for the wells in elm grove field are low risk development wells  designed to deplete undrained reserves 
in fort bend county  texas the company has numerous prospects identified within the frio and yegua intervals 
four shallow wells were drilled in with three successful wells yielding combined production totaling over  mcf of natural gas and barrels of crude oil per day 
a fifth well was spud in and is currently being completed 
a total of nine shallow ft 
bend county wells are budgeted for  and the company holds a five percent working interest in this prospect area 
in calcasieu parish  louisiana  the company is participating in the drilling of multiple prospects identified by a recent d seismic survey 
two of these prospects were drilling at year end and both were successfully completed in the first quarter of one of these wells sets up additional development and establishes production in a zone that is approximately eight miles from comparable production 
seven wells are budgeted for and the company s interest in this group of prospects is approximately percent 
outlook through selective screening of both customers and transaction profitability  the company restored positive earnings to its marketing business in presently  the marketplace for energy continues to be closely tied to credit availability as sellers of crude oil and natural gas seek financial security above all other factors 
with its strong balance sheet  the company believes its position is very stable and anticipates continued improvement 
in the long run  management believes the recent market changes will have a positive impact on the company s business 
leading up to the collapse of enron  an increase in the number of industry participants caused margins to shrink 
as substantial numbers of competitors have withdrawn  some improvements in margins have resulted 
this trend is especially noted in the wholesale distribution of crude oil and natural gas 
while generating significant marketing profits remains a challenge  management believes the company is one of the industry survivors well positioned for the future 
the economic outlook for the chemical industry  and hence the company s transportation operation promises little change for some obstacles being faced are high maintenance costs of an aging fleet  driver recruitment and retention  insurance costs  fuel cost increases  heightened security concerns and low competitive freight rates 
although not to the same degree but similar to the company s marketing business  there has recently been a shake out among chemical haulers as the industry struggles to maintain profitability 
for  the company must defend its customer base and hold down costs to remain competitive 
furthering the company s oil and gas exploration efforts in  the company will be participating in two separate d seismic surveys  among other ongoing projects 
one is a square mile d survey to be shot in calcasieu parish louisiana 
the operator of this survey has an excellent track record of success in this area s prolific hackberry trend 
actual fieldwork on the survey is expected to begin in march with the first well projected for spudding in the company will also participate in a square mile d survey to be shot in alabama 
this survey will evaluate d prospect leads in the smackover  eutaw  tuscaloosa and norphlet reservoirs 
initial drilling is planned for early projected seismic expenditures totaling million will be incurred and expensed in associated with these two projects 
one area to address is future general and administrative expense 
because of the turmoil caused by enron and others  and the related expansion of securities rules and regulations  the company ii expended million or percent of pre tax earnings on legal  consulting and accounting fees during in response to these issues 
while the company anticipates increased accounting costs in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act  overall  the amount of administrative fees should diminish from the prior year level 
such projected savings may be offset however  should insurance costs continue to rise 
during  the company experienced an average percent increase in the cost of all forms of insurance 
this brought the total cost of insurance for to million 
since the insurance marketplace remains in turmoil  the company cannot predict its overall future level of costs 
the company has the following major objectives for increase marketing operating earnings by percent to million 
maintain transportation operating earnings of at least million 
continue exploration efforts to grow the oil and gas reserve base by percent  however  earnings will be impacted by the expensing of million in planned seismic expenditures 
reduce general and administrative expenses by percent  or million 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled  such funds were utilized to make  in capital expenditures with the remaining million of cash flow from operations used to boost cash reserves and generally improve liquidity 
banking relationships the company s primary bank loan agreement  with bank of america  provides for two separate lines of credit with interest at the bank s prime rate minus of percent 
the working capital loan provides for borrowings up to  based on percent of eligible accounts receivable and percent of eligible inventories 
available capacity under the line is calculated monthly and as of december  was established at  the oil and gas production loan provides for flexible borrowings subject to a borrowing base established semi annually by the bank 
the borrowing base was established at  as of december  the line of credit loans are scheduled to expire on october   with the then present balance outstanding converting to a term loan payable in equal quarterly installments 
as of december   bank debt outstanding under the company s two revolving credit facilities totaled  the company s gulfmark energy  inc subsidiary maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its crude oil purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility also finances up to million of crude oil inventory and certain accounts receivable associated with crude oil sales 
such financing is provided on a demand note basis with interest at the bank s prime rate plus percent 
as of december   the company had million of eligible borrowing capacity under this facility 
no working capital advances were outstanding as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit under this facility without prior notification to the company 
ii the company s adams resources marketing subsidiary also maintains a separate banking relationship with bnp paribas in order to support its natural gas purchasing activities 
in addition to providing up to million in letters of credit  the facility finances up to million of general working capital needs on a demand note basis 
no working capital advances were outstanding under this facility as of december  letters of credit outstanding under this facility totaled approximately million as of december  under this facility  bnp paribas has the right to discontinue the issuance of letters of credit without prior notification to the company 
management maintains that the greatest uncertainty facing a marketing company is the banking community s continued willingness to support commodity credit facilities 
the events leading to enron s bankruptcy support this belief 
the company remains positioned to operate the commodity portions of its business without bank support should such a need develop 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains no off balance sheet arrangements other than certain operating lease arrangements to provide tractor and trailer equipment for the company s truck fleet 
all such operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment as provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual cash obligations in addition to its banking relationships and obligations  the company enters into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers  office space and other equipment and facilities 
a summary of contractual debt and lease obligations is as follows in thousands payment period thereafter total long term debt     operating leases     total      in addition to its bank debt and lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil      natural gas    refined products ii investment activities during  the company invested approximately  in oil and gas projects   for replacement equipment for its petrochemical trucking fleet and  was invested in equipment for the company s marketing operations 
oil and gas exploration and development efforts continue  and the company plans to invest approximately million toward such projects in including million of seismic costs to be expensed during the year 
an additional approximate million is currently projected to be expended toward purchasing transportation equipment as present lease financing arrangements mature 
insurance the marketplace for all forms of insurance has entered a period of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen severe cost increases to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the area of automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during  the company s insurance expense totaled  a percent increase over based on insurance renewals in  the company is anticipating further insurance increases for the company has no effective way to pass on such cost increases and any increase will thus need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially in excess of those which are available to the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting as an integral part of its marketing operation  the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related accounting pronouncements 
management believes this required accounting  commonly called mark to market accounting creates variations in reported earnings and the reported earnings trend 
under mark to market accounting  significant levels of earnings are recognized in the period of contract initiation rather than the period when the service is provided and title passes from supplier to customer 
as it affects the company s operation  management believes mark to market accounting impacts reported earnings and the presentation of financial condition in three important ways 
ii gross margins  derived from certain aspects of the company s ongoing business  are front ended into the period in which contracts are executed 
while there is no particular pattern to the timing of contract execution  it does tend to occur in clusters during those periods of time when the company s end user natural gas customers in new england perceive prices to be advantageous 
meanwhile  personnel and other costs associated with servicing accounts are expensed as incurred during the period of physical product flow and title passage 
mark to market earnings are calculated based on stated contract volumes 
one of the significant risks associated with the company s business is to convert stated contract or planned volumes into actual physical commodity movement volumes without a loss of margin 
again the planned profit from such commodity contracts is bunched and front ended into one period while the risk of loss associated with the difference between actual vs planned production or usage of oil and gas falls in a subsequent period 
cash flows  by their nature  match physical movements and passage of title 
mark to market accounting  on the other hand  creates a mismatch between reported earnings and cash flows 
this complicates and confuses the picture of stated financial conditions and liquidity 
the company attempts to mitigate the above described risks by only entering into contracts where current market quotes in actively traded  liquid markets are available to determine the fair value of contracts 
in addition  substantially all of the company s forward contracts are less than months in duration 
however  the reader is cautioned to develop a full understanding of how fair value or mark to market accounting creates differing reported results relative to those which would be presented under conventional accrual accounting 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the single most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing and oil and gas exploration and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties  including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to either absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to a the volume of transactions  b the complexity of transactions and c the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balance due and paying only bonafide properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
a degree of risk remains  however  simply due to the custom and practices of the industry 
ii oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many judgmental factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  changed prices  as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
estimated future oil and gas revenue calculations are also based on estimates by petroleum engineers as to the timing of oil and gas production  and there is no assurance that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation and other factors impact the market price for oil and gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and gas wells are capitalized 
however  estimated oil and gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and gas properties 
estimated oil and gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as would be typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management will evaluate the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition the company s natural gas and crude oil marketing customers are invoiced based on contractually agreed upon terms on a monthly basis 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its natural gas and crude oil trading activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s risk management activities is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
customers of the company s petroleum products marketing subsidiary are invoiced and revenue is recognized in the period when the customer physically takes possession and title to the product upon delivery at their facility 
transportation customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and gas passes to the purchaser 
ii new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the objective of sfas no 
is to establish one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale as well as resolve implementation issues related to sfas no 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  with no material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the objective of sfas no 
is to establish an accounting model for accounting and reporting obligations associated with retirement of tangible long lived assets and associated retirement costs 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company intends to adopt sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
the company has completed its assessment of sfas no 
at december   the company estimates that the present value of its future asset retirement obligations aro is approximately  the estimated cumulative effect of adoption of sfas no 
and the change in accounting principal will be a charge to net income during the first quarter of of approximately  or  net of taxes 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions were effective for various times throughout and did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally eitf issue no 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no

under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing ii future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
at this time  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk total long term debt at december  included  of floating rate debt 
as a result  the company s annual interest costs fluctuate based on interest rate changes 
because the interest rate on the company s long term debt is a floating rate  the fair value approximates carrying value as of december  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have had a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a month to year term with no contracts extending longer than three years in duration 
the company monitors all commitments and positions and endeavors to maintain a balanced portfolio 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the undiscounted fair value of such contracts is reflected on the company s balance sheet as risk management assets and liabilities 
the revaluation of such contracts is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
current market price quotes from actively traded liquid markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts undiscounted fair value 
regarding net risk management assets  percent of presented values as of december  and were based on readily available market quotations 
risk management assets and liabilities are classified as short term or long term depending on contract terms 
the estimated future net cash inflow based on year end market prices is  for and  for the estimated future cash inflow approximates the net fair value recorded in the company s risk management assets and liabilities 
ii the following table illustrates the factors impacting the change in the net value of the company s risk management assets and liabilities for the year ended december  in thousands net fair value on january   activity during cash received from settled contracts  net realized gain from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from prior years contracts net unrealized gain from current year contracts net fair value on december   historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility is expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  respectively  for the comparative years ended december  and ii
