best buy is a significant customer and accounted for of our sales in  in and in our business plan contemplates that best buy will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our sales in any year since results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected consolidated statements of income data expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income interest and other expense  net income before tax income tax expense minority interest net income cost of goods sold primarily consists of raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing costs associated with production of our products as well as warranty  warehousing and customer service expenses

no single foreign country accounted for greater than of our sales 
in the following discussion  certain increases or decreases may differ due to rounding 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million for from million for excluding currency effects  sales increased by million  or  to million for the increase in sales was primarily attributable to the addition of sales from our mb quart and q logic brands  increased sales of our lightning audio and install edge brands at big box retailers and strong sales from our oem business 
the increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in rockford fosgate sales during the period 
we believe the decrease in rockford fosgate sales reflected the continued weak retail environment for the mobile audio market and the resulting pressure on our independent specialty dealer channel 
additionally  in an effort to build brand image and solidify our relationships with core dealers  we discontinued shipping to several of our rockford fosgate brand dealers who were not operating in a manner consistent with our policies 
we elected to forego these sales in order to improve the quality of our dealer base and  if our efforts are successful  anticipate increased sales to dealers who comply with our policies will  over time  offset the forgone sales to these terminated dealers 
until the consumer market strengthens  we are planning for sales of our flagship rockford fosgate brand to be flat  compared to anticipated declines for the mobile audio market as a whole  and expect that most of our sales growth will continue to come from our newer brands 
us sales increased by million  or  to million for from million for  with the increase attributable to the factors discussed above 
international sales increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to increased sales in europe  canada and asia offset by a slight decrease in sales in latin america  due in part to the termination and replacement of our rockford fosgate distributor in latin america

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for from million for the primary reasons for the increase in general and administrative expenses were higher overhead cost structures for our mb quart and q logic brands and our acquired simpledevices business and increased legal costs

additionally  oem sales to nissan  which began in the third quarter of  and increased sales by lightning audio and installedge 
com  contributed to the increase in sales 
the increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in rockford fosgate sales during the period  reflective of the soft consumer market 
until the consumer market strengthens  we are planning for sales of our flagship rockford fosgate brand to be flat  compared to anticipated declines for the mobile audio market as a whole  and expect that most of our sales growth will come from our new brands 
us sales increased by million  or  to million for from million for  with the increase attributable to the factors discussed above

additionally  based on accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 business combinations  cost of goods sold relating to the finished goods inventory purchased in the acquisitions of audio innovations and mb quart was higher than we expect our manufactured cost to be 
once the finished goods inventory purchased through these acquisitions is sold and we begin selling our newly manufactured inventory  we believe cost of goods sold relating to these acquired product lines will decrease

additionally  abandoned acquisition costs of million were written off during the third quarter of these were previously capitalized costs for a proposed acquisition  which was abandoned and accordingly expensed 
as a percent of sales  general and administrative expenses  including abandoned acquisition costs  increased to for from for excluding abandoned acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses increased to of sales for research and development expenses

the effective income tax rates were for and for the primary reason for this increase in the effective tax rate was a decrease in foreign tax benefits from foreign net operating losses 
quarterly results of operations our sales on a quarterly basis reflect the seasonality of the mobile audio aftermarket business 
sales are generally greater during the second and third quarters of each calendar year and lower during the first and fourth quarters  with our lowest sales typically occurring during the fourth quarter 
our newly acquired nht business has seasonality that somewhat offsets this core business  with higher sales in the rd and th quarters 
because nht is a smaller business  we expect our business to remain seasonal for the foreseeable future 
the following tables show selected consolidated quarterly statements of income data that were derived from our unaudited financial statements for each of the eight quarters ended december   and also show that data expressed as a percent of sales for the periods indicated 
we believe these unaudited financial results were prepared on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for those periods

on june   we entered into a million revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and bank one  arizona  na this credit facility replaced a million line previously maintained with another financial institution 
we had working capital of million at december   compared to million at december  at december   we maintained million of cash and cash equivalent balances 
as at december   we had a balance of million on our million bank credit facility  which is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and consists of a swing line of credit and a revolving line of credit 
the swing line of credit has a variable interest rate per annum of prime 
the revolving line of credit has a blended variable interest rate of libor plus basis points 
as at december   the bank credit facility had a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
the bank credit facility is scheduled to mature on june  the bank credit facility contains provisions that  among other things  require that we maintain certain minimum levels of ebitda and debt service coverage and also limit the amount of debt incurred and capital expenditures annually 
during the second quarter of we extended our million capital lease credit facility under which we can fund leases until june   at which time the availability to enter into additional leases expires 
we use the capital lease credit facility for the purchase of capital equipment under agreements structured as three year capital lease obligations 
as at december   the capital lease credit facility had an outstanding balance of million with a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december   was lower than net income for the period  primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december   was primarily related to the acquisitions of simpledevices and nht in the fourth quarter of and to purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december   was primarily related to the acquisitions of audio innovations and mb quart in the third quarter of and to purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   and million for the twelve months ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december   was primarily a result of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which was partially offset by net repayments of our bank credit facility 
we believe our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations  coupled with availability on our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
however  should we pursue an acquisition larger than our existing resources can support  we may need to seek additional debt or equity resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  we recognize revenue and record sales  net of related discounts  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership has transferred to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell almost all of our products fob our facility  so that upon shipment of products  the above criteria are met and revenue is recognized 
additionally  rockford recognizes revenue from the sale of software in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
revenue is recorded from packaged software and license fees when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  the fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undeliverable products or services elements of the arrangement 
we also record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns and additional sales incentive offerings such as growth and volume incentive rebates and prompt pay discounts based on historical rates 
should a greater proportion of customers return product or redeem incentives than we estimate  we may need to make additional reductions to revenue 
intangible assets 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
when we account for acquired businesses as purchases  we allocate purchase prices to the assets  definite lived intangible assets  and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates 
based on these values  any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill prior to january   we amortized goodwill over the useful life of the underlying asset  not to exceed years 
on january   we began accounting for goodwill under the provisions of sfas nos 
and as at december   we had gross goodwill of  and accumulated amortization of  for the year ended december   we did not recognize amortization expense related to goodwill 
we completed two acquisitions in the third quarter of and two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and have not recorded any amortization for these acquisitions on amounts allocated to goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
resulted in an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately  for the year ended december  in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions about estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we have tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill as at december   and determined that our goodwill is not impaired and it is not necessary to undertake the second step in the two step process 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  based on historical rates  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we maintain a reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs might be required 
any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty 
we maintain a warranty reserve  based on historical rates  for costs associated with the repair or replacement of product that fails to meet our standard warranty against defects in material and workmanship 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated accruals would be required 
new accounting standards 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to use the accounting method prescribed by apb opinion no 
and had adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
eliminates the provisions of eitf no 
that required a liability to be recognized for certain exit or disposal activities at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
sfas no 
requires a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
inflation 
inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since we operate in a market that requires continuing price decreases 
we do not anticipate that inflation will not have a significant impact on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our holdings of cash equivalents are subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments and the relatively small cash balances we carry 
at december   we had a balance of million outstanding on our million bank credit facility  which is also subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the value of the us dollar affects our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and shareholders equity as expressed in us dollars 
historically  our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations was modest due to the fact that we sold our products primarily in us dollars and held only a small percentage of our assets outside the us however  we conduct a growing portion of our business in foreign currency and are increasing our billings in local currencies in japan  canada and europe 
during  million or of our sales were denominated in a currency other than us dollars 
at december   we had not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities  but instead have attempted to minimize currency exposure risk through natural hedges  which balance foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated liabilities 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially if a significant and sudden decline occurs in the value of local currencies 
during the first quarter of our board of directors approved and we began to implement a new foreign currency hedging policy 
the goal of the program is to provide stability to the us dollar values of non function currency cash flows 
although it is impossible to eliminate all currency risk  implementation of this program should mitigate the risk of significant changes in our earnings due to short term foreign exchange fluctuations
