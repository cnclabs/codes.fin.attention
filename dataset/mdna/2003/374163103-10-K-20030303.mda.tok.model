item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the form k and are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item titled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic and diagnostic products for applications in oncology and regenerative medicine  and research tools for drug discovery 
our product development programs are based upon three patented core technologies telomerase  human embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer 
in january  we resolved a federal lawsuit with the wisconsin alumni research foundation warf and entered into a new license for the commercialization of human embryonic stem cell technology 
the new agreement supersedes the earlier license  and resolves all issues related to the lawsuit filed by warf against us in august we do not expect an adverse accounting impact on our financial condition or results of operations related to this new license agreement 
our telomerase technology has continued to be in demand by companies exploring treatments for cancer and other applications 
in january  we signed a license agreement with genetic therapy  inc for our telomerase promoter technology for therapeutic products targeting cancer 
in july  we signed a license agreement with variagenics  inc for telomerase technology for pharmacogenomics applications 
in november  we signed a license agreement with pancel corporation for the use of telomerase to develop and commercialize macroencapsulated immortalized primary human pancreatic islet cells for the treatment of diabetes 
in each of these license agreements  we received a license fee and will receive royalties and milestone payments on future product sales 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates include useful lives for fixed assets for depreciation calculations  estimated lives for license agreements related to deferred revenue and assumptions for valuing options and warrants 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we consider that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from license and research agreements with collaborators 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under these collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs are incurred 
we recognize milestone fees upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research payments received which has not been earned 
we also have several license  option and marketing agreements with various oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production companies 
with each of these agreements  we may receive nonrefundable license payments in cash or equity securities  option payments in cash or equity securities  royalties on future sales of products  milestone payments  or any combination of these items 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize option payments as revenue over the period of the option agreement 
we recognize milestone payments upon completion of specified milestones according to contract terms 
we generally recognize royalties as revenue upon receipt 
we receive income from united states government grants that support our research efforts in defined research projects 
these grants generally provide for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various grants 
income associated with these grants is recognized upon receipt of reimbursement and is included in interest and other income on the consolidated statements of operations 
intangible asset and research funding obligation in may  we completed the acquisition of roslin bio med ltd  a privately held company formed by the roslin institute in midlothian  scotland 
in connection with this acquisition  we formed a research collaboration with the roslin institute and committed approximately  in research funding over six years 
using an effective interest rate of  this research funding obligation had a net present value of  and has been capitalized as an intangible asset that is being amortized as research and development expense over six years 
imputed interest is also being accreted to the value of the research funding obligation and is recognized as interest expense 
research and development expenses all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the value of acquired in process research and development is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expense  lab supplies  preclinical studies  raw materials to manufacture clinical trial drugs  manufacturing costs  sponsored research at other labs  consulting  legal fees and research related overhead 
accrued liabilities for raw materials to manufacture clinical trial drugs  manufacturing costs  patent legal fees and sponsored research reimbursement fees are included in accrued liabilities and included in research and development expenses 
employee stock plans as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are generally not required under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are required by sfas no 
to present  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the pro forma effects on reported net income and earnings per share as if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas no 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and will continue to fluctuate in the future based upon the timing and composition of funding under our various collaborative agreements  as well as the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized revenues from collaborative agreements of  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues in primarily reflected the final research support payment from our collaborative agreement with kyowa hakko 
revenues in and primarily represented research support payments from our collaborative agreements with kyowa hakko and pharmacia 
in  kyowa hakko ceased their research funding to us as contractually agreed 
the decrease in revenues in was a result of terminating our agreement with pharmacia in january we recognize revenue under collaborative agreements as we incur the related research and development costs 
we received million in funding payments under the kyowa hakko agreement in each of and  respectively 
we did not receive any funding payments from kyowa hakko in we recognized million and million in revenue for funding payments received under the pharmacia agreement in and  respectively 
we did not recognize any revenue under the pharmacia agreement in we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination 
we recognized license and option fee revenues of  and  in and  respectively related to our various agreements 
no license or option fees were recognized in also  we received royalties of   and  in  and  respectively on product sales of telomerase diagnostic kits to the research use only market and cell based research products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in   in   in   in and  thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future results 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of increased costs of million related to raw materials and manufacturing expenses for grn the increase in from was primarily the result of increased scientific personnel expenses of million  increased sponsored research of  and increased scientific supplies of million 
we expect research expenses to decrease in the future as a result of staff reductions in and and focusing efforts on our most advanced programs 
in our oncology area  we have concentrated our resources on two areas grn  a telomerase inhibitor drug and a telomerase therapeutic vaccine 
currently grn is in animal toxicology studies 
upon conclusive results from those animal studies  we expect to enter phase clinical studies with this product in we are currently sponsoring a phase clinical study at duke university medical center for a telomerase therapeutic vaccine for patients with prostate cancer 
in  we have enrolled half of the patients we intend to treat in the phase trial 
thus far  all of the treated patients have responded appropriately to the vaccine and no adverse reactions have been seen 
the results of this study will be further evaluated in and future clinical progress of this product will depend on the study results 
in our regenerative medicine area  we have concentrated our resources on four specific cell types hesc derived neural cells for spinal cord injury and parkinson s disease  hematopoietic cells for transplantation  cardiomyocytes for heart failure and pancreatic islet cells for diabetes 
we are engaged in animal proof of concept testing for these cell types 
if these tests are successful  we will continue clinical development of these products in accordance with fda guidelines 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an initial drug application ind 
if successful  an ind allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda must be filed with the fda  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda must be reviewed by the fda 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and changed to reflect the most recent clinical and preclinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot assure you that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products and entry into clinical trials with one or more products may not result in any commercially viable products in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this form k 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due to reduced personnel related costs of  as a result of the restructuring in june  reduced business consulting expenses of million and reduced legal expenses of million 
the increase in from was the result of a net increase in personnel related costs of  and legal expenses of  offset by reduced business consulting expenses of million 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease in the near future as a result of the reductions in staffing in june and january interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to and was primarily due to lower interest rates and decreasing cash and investment balances 
interest earned in the future will depend on any future funding cycles and prevailing interest rates 
we also received   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect income from government grants to decrease in the future 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense in was primarily the result of reduced equipment loan payments 
the decrease in interest and other expense for was primarily the result of lower expenses related to convertible debentures 
in connection with the issuance of series d convertible debentures in june  we recorded approximately  in interest expense for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date of signing and the conversion price of the debentures 
in addition  we recorded the million value of the warrant issued with the series d convertible debentures as a charge to interest expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
at the end of  we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of eitf issue  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios  to certain convertible instruments eitf 
this new principle required us to modify the way we calculated the interest expense recognized for the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the closing date of the convertible debenture financing and the conversion price of the debentures 
we were required to apply this new accounting principle retroactively to the september series c convertible debenture issuance 
as a result of adopting this new accounting principle  we recognized million in imputed non cash interest expense and have recorded this charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in conversion expense in connection with the restructuring agreement for our series d convertible debentures in november  we modified the terms of million of our outstanding series d convertible debentures by reducing the conversion price to of the closing bid price on the date of conversion by the investor and  as a result  we recorded million as conversion expense 
the conversion expense was calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the common stock issued on the date of conversion and the fair market value of common stock that would have been issued under the original agreement 
we also modified the terms of the remaining million of our series d convertible debentures to extend the maturity date to june   increase the yield on the debenture to  and fix the conversion price at per share 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related warrants that were originally issued with our series d convertible debentures to reset the exercise price of of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to june  series d warrants and of the warrants to per share and extend the exercise period to december  series d warrants 
the difference between the current fair values of the original series d warrants and the amended series d and d warrants was recorded as conversion expense of million 
we also recorded the remaining million of the amended series d convertible debentures at a fair value of million with the offsetting difference of million being recorded as conversion expense 
the fair values used in calculating the conversion expense associated with the series d and d warrants and the amended series d convertible debentures were based on values determined through the assistance of an independent valuation 
as of december   we had million of series d convertible debentures outstanding 
the million excess of the initial fair value over the face value of the debentures is being amortized over the life of the debentures as a reduction to interest expense  in and  in 
we are also accruing interest on the amended debentures as interest expense over the life of the debentures  in and  in 
net loss losses before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net losses after cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of reduced revenues from collaborative agreements offset by lower conversion expense related to convertible debentures 
the decrease in net loss in compared to was the net result of higher operating expenses  conversion expense related to amending series d convertible debentures and warrants  decreased revenues from collaborative agreements and reduced interest expense and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper and municipal securities 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in and was the result of cash used in operations 
net cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in net cash used in operations in was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses and a decrease in revenues 
we expect that our net cash used in operations will decrease in as a result of reductions in staffing in june and january through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through an equipment financing arrangement 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total    and  in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our equipment financing facilities 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facilities expires on september  we intend to renew the commitment for new equipment financing facilities in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  then we will need to spend our own resources for equipment purchases 
in june  we sold million in series d zero coupon convertible debentures and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor 
the debentures were convertible at any time by the holder at a fixed conversion price of per share 
if unconverted  the debentures had a maturity date of june  the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercisable at per share at the option of the holder through december in november  million of series d convertible debentures were converted by the holder into approximately  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  reflecting a modification of the terms of these debentures 
we amended the terms of the remaining million of series d convertible debentures to carry a coupon  have a fixed conversion price of per share and have the maturity date extended to june we also amended the outstanding series d warrants 
the amended series d warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock is exercisable at per share through june  the amended series d warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock is exercisable at per share through december  as of december   million of series d convertible debentures and series d and d warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock remained outstanding 
in december  we sold million of our common stock under our equity line financing facility and issued approximately  shares 
this line expired in september in june  we restructured the organization to focus our resources on our most advanced product development programs 
in the process  we reduced our research staff by employees and our support staff by employees  a reduction of approximately of our work force in menlo park  california and edinburgh  scotland 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  of which  related to research and development expense and  related to general and administrative expense 
as of december   no further amounts were due as a result of this restructuring 
in january  we reduced our research staff by employees and our support staff by employees 
we changed the organization in order to concentrate our resources on the continued development of our lead anti cancer product  grn  and our regenerative medicine products based on human embryonic stem cells hescs 
we expect to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of of approximately  of which  relates to research and development expense and  relates to general and administrative expense 
our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter are as follows principal payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years amounts in thousands convertible debentures   equipment loans operating leases   research funding    product manufacturing   total contractual cash obligations    this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
our convertible debentures may be converted to common stock prior to their maturity date and therefore may not require use of our capital resources 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various academic laboratories around the world  including the roslin institute 
in july  we entered into a manufacturing agreement to produce gmp grade grn for preclinical and clinical studies 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facilities will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through december  changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities with three financial institutions in the united states 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore  bear minimal risk 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of high grade corporate bonds and us government agency securities 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million in long term investments which are due in one to two years 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate notes and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
for the fiscal year end  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  our financial obligations to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next three years 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pounds sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
