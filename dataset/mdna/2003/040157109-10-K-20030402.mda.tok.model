renewal premiums for the year ended december  were approximately million 
the retention rate was approximately of policies written in the prior year and of written premium for the year ended december  this is a reflection of the current environment of the excess and surplus lines market  in that the current year premium has a similar risk profile to expiring business  and is being written at higher rates 
partially offsetting these increases were cancellations and endorsements which reduced gross written premiums by approximately million 
results for the year ended december  include activity for the four months since acquisition of colony 
the excess and surplus lines segment s loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the four month period ended december   the increase in the loss ratio during was attributable to two factors

specialty workers compensation 
specialty workers compensation is the primary line of insurance written by argonaut insurance company 
argonaut insurance company generally targets companies whose workers compensation needs will result in significant annual premiums generally between  and million 
these classes of insurance require specific underwriting expertise and a commitment to enhance the safety of the workplace 
insureds partner with argonaut insurance company to effectively manage losses 
the following table summarizes the results of operations for the specialty workers compensation segment years ended december  in millions gross written premiums premiums earned losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting expense underwriting loss interest income  net segment loss combined ratio gross written premiums for the year ended december  include approximately million in premiums on new policies  an increase of approximately million over the increase was primarily attributable to business acquired through a renewal rights purchase and small workers compensation products 
renewal premiums for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million over the specialty workers compensation segment s retention ratio was  with an average premium rate increase of 
gross written premiums were comparable for the years ended december  and gross earned premiums increased million on core retained business in versus the decline in net premiums earned in as compared to was primarily the result of increased ceded premiums 
for policies incepting subsequent to september   reinsurance coverage was purchased which decreased the specialty workers compensation loss retention from million to  per occurrence 
the effect of this treaty along with significantly higher reinsurance rates obtained for the january  renewal reinsurance treaties  covering losses incurred above million  resulted in significantly increased ceded premiums in the increase in rates for reinsurance treaties incepting on january  was primarily driven by the terrorist attacks of september  the increase in earned premiums in as compared to was primarily the result of additional earned premiums on retrospectively rated policies 
losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended december  resulted in a loss ratio of  compared to and for and  respectively 
the company began to re underwrite the specialty workers compensation book of business in the second half of in an effort to obtain rate increases and improve risk selection 
losses and loss adjustment expenses reported in include losses of approximately million attributable to a single policy from a program that incepted three years ago 
the company no longer insures this risk effective january  as of december   and  the following is certain claims data with respect to specialty workers compensation open claims    claims closed during year    average net paid loss on closed claims    average net outstanding loss on open claims    net losses and loss adjustment expenses reported in and include reserve strengthening of million and million  respectively 
loss reserves for this segment were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the reserve strengthening in and was primarily the result of deteriorating results for the company s california business 
a california legal ruling adverse to the industry referred to as the minnear decision was a primary driver increasing claims severity 
this decision gave a worker s physician control in determining all aspects of a worker s medical condition which significantly reduced an insurer s ability to manage the claim 
the recognition of levels of claims severity escalation began emerging in and continued into as a result  the company  as well as the workers compensation industry in california  reported deteriorating results 
recognition of the full effect of this legal ruling was delayed due to the nature of workers compensation injuries  the subjective nature of the system which administers the claims and the amount of time from the accident occurring and the claimant passing through the system 
the claims experience related to increased severities could be an indication of a trend in the state of california and other states  and increase ultimate losses for future accident years 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on actuarial methods that include various techniques and include industry data as well as company specific data 
an independent actuarial firm reviews the company s specialty workers compensation reserves quarterly 
the expense ratio for the specialty workers compensation segment was for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
lower earned premiums in due to higher ceded premiums are causing the expense ratio increase in in addition  commissions  premiums taxes  licenses and bureau fees are a function of written premiums as opposed to earned premiums 
these expenses increased for due to the increase in written premiums as discussed above 
during  this segment deferred million of acquisition costs 
acquisition costs were not deferred during the decrease in underwriting expense in as compared to was primarily the result of cost saving initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of  focusing on reducing compensation and outside service expenses 
additionally  during  deferred acquisition costs of approximately million were written off 
in the first half of  argonaut insurance company will reorganize its operations to concentrate on casualty risk management solutions for upper middle market accounts  which have been the historical core of its business 
with the elimination of non strategic businesses  argonaut insurance company will reduce its workforce by percent over the first and second quarters of and will incur a reorganization charge of approximately million in the first half of the reorganization will also have the effect of reducing operating expenses in the latter half of and in future years 
in its refocused configuration  argonaut insurance company is expected to produce less than percent of the group s gross written premium on a prospective basis 
decreases in net investment income were the result of declining invested assets coupled with declining yields 
total invested assets  as respect to specialty workers compensation  declined from million at december  to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decline in the invested balances between and was primarily related to the disbursement of funds related to the acquisition of front royal 
public entity 
trident functions as a managing general underwriter  dedicated to servicing the insurance needs of governmental entities throughout the united states 
trident  through argonaut great central and  to a lesser extent  argonaut insurance company  provides property and casualty insurance to municipalities with populations of less than  counties with populations of less than  and special purpose districts such as water districts

additionally  the segment wrote million of renewal business  of which million represented rate increases 
the public entity segment s retention ratio was during losses and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended december  resulted in a loss ratio of compared to for net loss reserves for the public entity segment were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the expense ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the increase in the expense ratio primarily resulted from a reduced ceding commission on the segment s quota share reinsurance agreement 
run off lines 
the company has discontinued active underwriting of certain lines of business 
the company is still obligated to pay losses incurred on these lines which include general liability and medical malpractice policies written in past years 
the lines currently in run off are characterized by long elapsed periods between the occurrence of a claim and any ultimate payment to resolve the claim 
the company utilizes a specialized staff dedicated to administer and settle these claims 
for the year ended december   the run off segment recorded a segment loss of million 
the segment loss was the result of reserve strengthening of approximately million discussed below  plus an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to reinsurance recoverable balances of approximately million 
argonaut insurance company is exposed to asbestos liability at the primary level through claims filed against its direct insureds  as well as through its position as a reinsurer of other primary carriers 
argonaut insurance company s direct liability arises primarily from policies issued from the mid s to early s which pre dated policy contract wording that excluded asbestos exposure 
the majority of the policies were issued on behalf of small contractors or construction companies 
the company believes that the frequency and severity of asbestos claims for such insureds is typically less than that experienced for large  industrial manufacturing and distribution concerns 
argonaut insurance company also assumed risk as a reinsurer for a limited period of time  primarily for the period from to  a portion of which was assumed from the london market 
argonaut insurance company reinsured risks on policies written by direct carriers 
the reinsurance typically provided coverage for limits attaching at a relatively high dollar amount which are payable only after other layers of reinsurance are exhausted 
some of the claims now being filed on policies reinsured by argonaut insurance company are on behalf of claimants who may have been exposed at some time to asbestos incorporated into buildings they occupied  but have no current medical problems resulting from such exposure 
additionally  lawsuits are being brought against businesses that were not directly involved in the manufacture or installation of materials containing asbestos 
the company believes that claims generated out of this population of claimants will likely be characterized by high frequency but low severity  resulting in incurred losses generally lower than the asbestos claims filed over the past decade and could be below argonaut insurance company s attachment level 
corporate policy beginning in was to exclude asbestos coverage on all general liability policies 
during the third quarter of  management identified claims associated with certain general liability policies issued through one office from to the early s which did not exclude absolute asbestos coverage 
the company strengthened its loss reserves by million in the third quarter for these claims 
the company reviewed policy files issued during this period for additional exposures and management believes the policies written were limited to this specific time frame and location

argonaut insurance company conducted a study of its asbestos and environmental reserves in the fourth quarter of  and as a result strengthened its asbestos reserves by million 
the decision to strengthen asbestos reserves was the result of an evaluation and review of exposure to asbestos claims  particularly in light of recent industry and litigation trends  actual claims experience  and actuarial analysis by the company s consulting and internal actuaries 
however  some uncertainty remains regarding the severity and frequency of future claims to the extent that other carriers and policyholders may not have provided notice of loss or addressed issues of coverage 
additional uncertainty is created by continued unfavorable trends in the insurance industry related to asbestos 
all of these factors were considered as part of the decision to strengthen reserves in the fourth quarter of although legislative reform for class action lawsuits  judicial and legislative actions imposing minimum proof requirements  and other tort related reforms are possible in the near term  the study did not take these mitigating factors into account in evaluating the severity or frequency of claims 
total reserves for environmental and asbestos claims were million  net of reinsurance 
management uses various actuarial methods to determine the potential range of losses for the run off lines in total  which resulted in a range of potential ultimate liability  net of reinsurance  of million to million 
in determining their best estimate  management primarily relied on the report year method 
the report year method relies the most heavily on the company s historical claims and severity information  whereas other methods rely more heavily on industry information 
as a result of this reserve increase  the reserve for incurred but not reported environmental and asbestos claims net of reinsurance at december   was million for total environmental and asbestos reserves  compared to million as of december  the reserve for incurred but not reported claims for the remaining run off lines net of reinsurance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the following table represents a reconciliation of environmental and asbestos claims outstanding for each of the years in the three year period ended december open claims  beginning of the year    claims closed during the year    claims opened during the year    open claims  end of the year    the following table represents gross payments on asbestos and environmental claims for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in millions gross payments on closed claims gross payments on open claims total gross payments the above tables indicate downward trends in the number of open claims and total gross payments over the past three years 
due to the types of coverages within argonaut insurance company s run off lines of business  a significant amount of judgment and uncertainty exists in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
factors that increase these uncertainties are lack of historical data  inapplicability of standard actuarial projection techniques  uncertainties regarding ultimate claim costs  coverage interpretations  and the judicial  statutory and regulatory environments under which these claims may ultimately be resolved 
significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate liability to the company due to the potentially long waiting period between exposure and emergence of any bodily injury or property damage and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims 
additionally  recent industry trends show an increasing number of claims being filed by individuals who claim asbestos exposure  but who have no symptoms of asbestos related disease 
due to these uncertainties  the current trends cannot be relied on to predict future results 
the company  through its subsidiary argonaut insurance company  has been named in various legal actions filed by macarthur company  western asbestos company and certain other individual claimants 
argonaut insurance company s involvement in these actions stems from nine construction wrap up policies with an occurrence limit of  per policy issued to western macarthur company and western asbestos company  respectively  for liability arising out of work performed on five construction sites in the s and s 
management estimates that approximately of the claimants in the purported class action suits against western macarthur were associated in any way with the job sites covered by the argonaut insurance company policies 
argonaut insurance company has in the ordinary course of business set up reserves in connection with these claims in prior years 
based on this limited exposure  management believes current reserves are sufficient to cover any losses which may arise out of these actions 
although management has determined and recorded its best estimate of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for run off lines  current judicial and legislative decisions continue to broaden liability  expand policy scopes and increase the severity of claims payments 
as a result of these and other recent developments  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate loss reserves are heightened  further complicating the already complex process of determining loss reserves 
the industry as a whole is involved in extensive litigation over these coverages and liability issues  and must contend with the continuing uncertainty in its effort to quantify these exposures 
liquidity and capital resources the nature of insurance is that cash collected on premiums written is invested  interest and dividends are earned thereon  and loss and settlement expenses are paid out over a period of years 
this period of time varies by line of business and by the circumstances surrounding each claim 
a substantial portion of the company s loss and loss expenses are paid out over more than one year 
additional cash outflow occurs through payments of underwriting and acquisition costs such as commissions  taxes  payrolls and general overhead expenses 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared with net cash used of million and million in and  respectively 
the cash flow provided by operations in was primarily the result of an increase in gross written premiums 
the cash flow used for operations in was primarily attributable to claims payments for run off lines 
the cash flow used for operations in was the result of claims payments on run off lines combined with payments on claims incurred on workers compensation policies written in prior years 
the company invests excess cash in a variety of investment securities 
as of december   the company s investment portfolio consisted of fixed maturities  equities and other  compared to fixed maturities  equities and other for the same period in the company classifies its investment portfolio as available for sale  therefore all investments are reported at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses being reported as a component of shareholders equity 
the current downturn in the investment markets  particularly the equities market  has resulted in shareholder s equity being reduced by approximately million  net of tax  due to the reduction of unrealized gains 
as of december   the company held common stock in curtiss wright corp 
with a fair market value of million  or approximately of total shareholders equity 
as of december   the company had no investment in any one investment exceeding of shareholder s equity 
the company s insurance subsidiaries require liquidity and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants  and to cover operating expenses 
during the three years ended december   the company s liquidity generated from operations and investment income were sufficient to meet obligations 
adequate levels of liquidity and surplus are maintained to manage the risks inherent with any differences between the duration of its liabilities and invested assets 
the company believes it maintains sufficient liquidity to pay claims and expenses  as well as unforeseen events such as reinsurer insolvencies  inadequate premium rates  or reserve deficiencies 
the company maintains a comprehensive reinsurance program at levels management considers adequate to diversify risk and safeguard its financial position 
across all sectors  reinsurance rates have substantially increased 
the additional reinsurance costs of the company s program  to the extent not passed on to customers through increased rates  may have a negative impact on liquidity 
the company entered into a retroactive adverse loss development reinsurance agreement on december  to initially cede million of carried reserves for the workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability and asbestos  environmental and other latent losses lines of business 
at december   million has been recorded as reinsurance funds withheld and as ceded reinsurance payable  which was paid during the first quarter of the agreement provides up to million of future adverse development  if any  on workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability and asbestos  environmental and other latent losses 
the cessions for adverse development are calculated on a tiered structure and subject to certain limitations 
the company has the option to commute the reinsurance agreement at any time if the funds withheld balance is positive 
the reinsurance agreement is effective for reserves as of december   with the exception of reserves for asbestos  environmental  and other latent losses which are effective as of september  a trust has also been established to secure payments owed to the company from the reinsurer 
the company is the sole beneficiary of this trust 
securities of approximately million were transferred to the trust as of december   and securities of approximately million were transferred to the trust in february to secure such payments 
concerns over terrorist activity have both curtailed the availability of reinsurance for terrorism related risks and increased the cost of obtaining such reinsurance where it is still available 
the effect of this industry wide phenomenon on argonaut group s insurance subsidiaries varies by line of business  but reinsurance coverage for terrorist acts involving nuclear  biological and chemical agents is no longer available or cost prohibitive in some instances  thus preventing ceding of these risks through reinsurance 
argonaut group s insurance subsidiaries have reviewed their accounts for potential exposure to these risks as well as other risks in order to make appropriate decisions on policy exclusions  pricing and renewals  although laws in many states and particularly those relating to workers compensation insurance place limits on the ability of insurers to effectively address these risks by contract 
in addition to its investment portfolio  the company s subsidiaries own real property for use as home office facilities for argonaut insurance company and argonaut great central  as well as three commercial properties in california 
these real properties are included in other assets valued at million  which is their original cost less accumulated depreciation 
the current fair market value of the three commercial properties is estimated at million  based on appraisals completed in november subsequent to december   the company closed the sale of a parcel of undeveloped property see discussion on page various state insurance laws restrict the amount that may be transferred to the company from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
in addition  that portion of the company s net equity which results from the difference between statutory insurance accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principals would not be available for dividends

the insurance subsidiaries must maintain certain levels of policyholders surplus to support premium writings 
guidelines of the national association of insurance commissioners suggest that a property and casualty insurer s ratio of annual statutory net premium written to policyholders surplus should not exceed to the ratio of combined annual statutory net premium written by the insurance subsidiaries to their combined policyholders surplus was to as of december  current levels of policyholders surplus are adequate to support current premium writings  based on this standard 
the company is currently monitoring premium and statutory surplus levels of the insurance subsidiaries to ensure that the subsidiaries maintain adequate premiums to surplus ratio 
failure of any insurance subsidiary to maintain adequate levels of policyholders surplus could negatively impact the ability to write additional premiums 
in addition  regulators and rating agencies utilize a risk based capital test designed to measure the acceptable amounts of capital and surplus an insurer should maintain  based on specific inherent risks of each insurer 
insurers failing to meet this benchmark level may be subject to scrutiny by the insurer s domiciliary insurance department and potentially result in rehabilitation or liquidation 
as of december   argonaut insurance company s rbc ratio was within the company action level event 
at this level  the regulated insurer is required to submit a comprehensive plan of action to the regulatory body detailing the steps it is taking to raise the rbc ratio above the minimum specified by statute 
the plan  to be submitted to the california department of insurance  must contain the following o an analysis of the conditions that contributed to the company s financial condition  o proposals to improve argonaut insurance company s rbc  o projections of the company s financial results  such as operating income  net income  capital and surplus  with and without proposed corrective actions  o key assumptions underlying the projections and their related sensitivity  and o quality of and problems with the company s business 
the following factors contributed to deterioration of the company s rbc ratio during the year ended december  o reserve increases for asbestos and environmental liabilities  o declines in the fair value of the equity portfolio  o high rate of growth in gross written premiums  and o losses in the specialty workers compensation segment 
argonaut insurance company s plan to increase rbc includes o reducing its exposure to the equity markets  o selling certain real estate holdings that will result in realized gains and therefore increase surplus  o scaling back operations of the less profitable business segments  and o pursuing capital raising avenues 
the company is in the process of documenting its plan to the california department of insurance detailing the actions argonaut insurance company will implement to restore the rbc ratio to above minimum requirements
