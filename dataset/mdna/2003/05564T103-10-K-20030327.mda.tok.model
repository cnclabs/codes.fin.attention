results of operations compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of compared to apartment related income apartment rental income plus income from apartment management and investment activities accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in totaled million  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to million rental income at three apartment communities that we acquired during  which offsets declines at other communities 
on a same units basis for the  units that we owned throughout all of both and  apartment rental income declined by in compared to on a same units basis  average economic occupancy was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied apartment was compared to in in  average economic occupancy for all apartments including barrington place  brookford place and alta harbour  which we acquired during was  and average revenue per occupied apartment was the same factors we cited in as having a negative effect on our apartment markets  an oversupply of apartments  significant job losses and surprisingly strong sales of modestly priced homes  continued and  in fact  intensified in significant new apartment construction over the past few years has resulted in an oversupply of apartments in virtually all of our markets 
while construction activity slowed in  the number of apartments currently available in most markets clearly exceeds demand 
this has led to intense competition for residents with discounts  specials  concessions and free rent being the rule  rather than the exception 
for the first time in many years we saw true erosion in both rental rates and occupancy in our apartment markets 
until the excess supply of apartments is absorbed  we expect the competition for residents will remain intense 
compounding the impact of oversupply  falling interest rates and a general economic slowdown have resulted in reduced demand for apartments 
low interest rates have made single family home ownership far more affordable 
on the other hand  the economic slowdown has led to significant job losses in our markets 
while the underlying explanation as to why declining interest rates or an economic slowdown impact apartment operations is quite different  both have the effect of reducing the pool of potential apartment residents  which in turn puts further negative pressure on occupancy and rental rates 
while we remain confident in the long term prospects for our apartment properties and our markets  we do not expect material improvement in apartment operations until the economy strengthens sufficiently to promote job growth and increased demand for apartments 
exactly when this will occur is outside of our control and beyond our ability to predict 
in the meantime  we cannot allow short term market conditions to distract us from our long term plans and objectives 
we have assembled a portfolio of high quality  well maintained  well located  middle market apartment communities 
our goal is to maximize the performance of our apartment properties 
we believe the best course of action for us at this time is to work diligently to improve occupancy and to continue to maintain and improve our apartment properties to ensure that they are as competitive as possible 
restaurant rental income in totaled million  a decline of compared to the decrease in restaurant rental income is due to the sale of one restaurant property in april restaurant rental income during both and was the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement 
under our master lease with enterprises  restaurant rental income payments are the greater of specified minimum rent or of food sales 
minimum rent is set at approximately  per month  or  per year  per restaurant property 
following the sale of one additional restaurant in february  minimum rent is currently set at  per month 
same store sales for the restaurants that were open throughout all of both and declined by in compared to sales at these restaurants would have to increase by approximately before we would receive rent exceeding the minimum rent 
we do not expect restaurant rental income to exceed the minimum in management fee income in totaled million  a significant increase compared to million in this increase is attributable to a significant increase in the number of managed properties in the fourth quarter of and early we expect this comparison to decline due to our acquisition of barrington place and brookford place which we previously fee managed in may as well as termination of contracts for management of several smaller properties 
interest and other income totaled  in compared to  in this comparison reflects the impact of non routine income totaling approximately  in  as well as a decline in interest income during expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  in were million  an increase of million  or  compared to apartment operations expense totaled million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of three apartment communities million during on a same units basis  apartment operations expense increased by in compared to  reflecting the impact of higher costs for insurance  increase in for these communities  along with higher costs associated with marketing and maintenance 
apartment operations expense includes only direct costs of on site operations 
apartment operations expense in represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in there is a tendency to respond to markets like those we are currently facing by indiscriminately slashing expenses 
we will certainly strive to avoid unnecessary expenditures  but will not sacrifice the long term potential of our apartment properties by delaying or deferring needed repairs  maintenance or capital improvements in order to achieve more favorable short term results 
in fact  maximizing the performance of our apartment properties in the current market environment may well require spending more money on marketing and maintenance than might be necessary in more favorable markets 
while we do not intend to squander money on unnecessary expenses  we believe that competitive markets  such as the one we find ourselves in today  may in fact require increased expenses 
we incur no operating expenses for restaurant properties  because the triple net lease arrangement requires the lessee to pay virtually all the costs and expenses associated with the restaurant properties 
apartment administration expense the costs associated with oversight  accounting and support of our apartment management activities for both owned and third party properties totaled million in  an increase of compared to this increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in the number of managed properties in the fourth quarter of and early corporate administration expense totaled million in  an increase of compared to this increase is primarily attributable to executive bonuses paid in the fourth quarter of along with the cost of an executive compensation study conducted during depreciation expense totaled million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of three apartment communities  in  as well as the impact of additions and replacements at other apartment communities 
we have generally assigned shorter lives to these specifically identifiable assets than the composite lives initially assigned at acquisition 
amortization expense totaled  in  compared to  in effective january   in accordance with current accounting guidance  we no longer amortize the intangible related to our acquisition of management operations 
amortization expense for this asset was approximately  each year in and interest expense totaled million in  an increase of compared to this increase reflects the impact of approximately million in new debt related to apartment acquisitions in the second and third quarters of  offset by the effect of lower interest rates on our lines of credit and the impact of refinancing two fixed rate loans at lower rates during and early variable interest rates have declined approximately since december overall  weighted average interest rates were in  compared to in in conjunction with the refinancing of long term debt in the first quarter of  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of  we have reflected this write off  net of minority interests share  with a charge of  as an extraordinary item in the financial statements 
in late december  we issued  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
in september  we issued an additional  shares of this preferred stock 
because preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders for receipt of dividends  we deduct the amount of net income that will be paid to preferred shareholders in calculating net income available to common shareholders 
the cumulative preferred dividend totaled approximately  for  compared to  for four days in the fourth quarter of the dividend on the series b shares is per year per share 
the total cumulative preferred dividend will increase to  for for the  shares currently outstanding 
net income income available to common shareholders in  after the cumulative preferred dividend  was  a decrease of compared to operating partnership earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and extraordinary item totaled million  a decrease compared to the minority interest in operating partnership earnings in was  a decrease compared to these comparisons reflect the favorable impact of lower interest rates and the effect of discontinuing amortization of the intangible related to management operations  offset by the effect of declines in revenues from apartment operations  and further impacted by the effect of non routine and non recurring revenues during and the cumulative preferred dividend in income available to common shareholders was per share in compared to in compared to revenues total revenue in was million  an increase of compared to apartment related income apartment rental income plus income from apartment management and investment activities accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in apartment rental income in was million  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to million rental income at oak hollow apartments phase  which we acquired in december on a same units basis for the  units that we owned throughout all of both years  apartment rental income declined by in compared to on a same units basis  average economic occupancy was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied apartment was compared to in average economic occupancy for all apartments including oak hollow apartments phase  which we acquired in december was in compared to in  and average monthly revenue per occupied apartment was in compared to in with the exception of virginia beach  virginia  our apartment markets weakened during compared to slight increases in revenue per occupied apartment were insufficient to overcome the impact of declines in occupancy 
the weakness in the markets was largely the result of overbuilding  compounded by the impact of declining interest rates and a general economic slowdown 
restaurant rental income in was million  a decrease of compared to restaurant rental income accounted for of our total revenue in compared to in the decrease in restaurant rental income is due to the sales of one restaurant property in april and one restaurant property in june restaurant rental income during both and was the minimum rent specified in the lease agreement 
effective january   we acquired the minority interest in bnp management  inc the management company 
for  we included the revenues from management services for three third party owned properties in our consolidated revenue amounts 
in  we reported net equity income related to activities of the management company 
this change in basis of presentation did not have a significant impact on our financial position  overall operating results or cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we expanded our third party management activities by entering into contracts to manage multi family communities 
management fee income totaled  in  including  generated from new contracts during the fourth quarter 
if the former management company activities had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  equity income as reported would have been replaced with management fee income of approximately  in interest and other income includes approximately  non routine income in recurring interest and other income was generally comparable to amounts 
the non routine income items in are as follows o  shared appreciation related to our participating loan agreement with the villages of chapel hill limited partnership  discussed below  o  fee income for arranging refinancing at the villages of chapel hill and the villages of chapel hill phase  two managed apartment properties  and o  miscellaneous income  for the refund of and state franchise taxes 
effective july   we modified our participating loan agreement with the villages of chapel hill limited partnership 
this modification established a  fixed portion of our participation in the increase in value of the property and extended the period for our participation in increased rental revenue and increase in value of the property to the earlier of july or sale or refinance of the property 
we received an initial payment of  of the fixed portion in july  which we reflected in the financial statements as other income 
required payment of the fixed portion is subject to cash flow from the villages property  calculated every six months  as defined in the agreement 
interest on the outstanding fixed portion accrues at the greater of a prime rate or  payable monthly 
because the timing of payment of the remaining fixed portion is subject to cash flow and therefore uncertain  we have provided a reserve for collection of this receivable  and we recognize revenue as it is realized 
expenses total expenses  including non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  in were million  an increase of compared to apartment operations expense was million in  an increase of  or million  compared to this increase is attributable to the addition of one apartment community  in  along with the impact of higher costs for on site compensation  property taxes and insurance  and property administration and turnover costs 
apartment operations expense includes only direct costs of on site operations 
apartment operations expense in represented of related apartment rental income  compared to in during the second half of  we experienced a significant increase in redecoration and turnover expense at our apartment communities 
intense competition due to overbuilding  home purchases  and job losses due to the current economic slowdown all contributed to higher turnover of residents 
as a result  we spent more in turnover and redecoration  as well as leasing and promotion expense  in an effort to attract and retain residents 
apartment administration expense totaled million in  including approximately  in costs directly related to servicing third party management contracts acquired during the fourth quarter of the year 
if the activities of the management company had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  apartment administration expense would have been approximately  in the increase in apartment administration expense in is attributable to the impact of the increase in the number of units under management  as well as increased property management supervisory compensation and travel expenditures 
corporate administration expense totaled million in if the activities of the management company had been reflected on a consolidated basis in our financial statements  corporate administration expense would have been approximately million in the increase in corporate administration expense in is attributable to increased executive and corporate office staff compensation 
depreciation expense totaled million in  an increase of  or  compared to this increase is attributable to the addition of one apartment community  in along with the impact of additions and replacements at other apartment communities 
amortization expense totaled  in  essentially unchanged from these amounts for both and include  amortization of the intangible related to management operations 
interest expense totaled million in  a decline of compared to this decline is primarily attributable to the decline in interest rates during overall  weighted average interest rates were in  compared to in in conjunction with a refinance of long term debt in september  we wrote off unamortized loan costs of  we have reflected this write off  net of minority interests share  with a charge of  as an extraordinary item in the financial statements

funds available for distribution totaled million in  a decrease of compared to funds available for distribution totaled million in  an increase of compared to million in the variance in comparison of funds available for distribution and funds from operations reflects the impact of recurring capital expenditures for major capital maintenance costs at our older communities 
recurring capital expenditures averaged per apartment unit in  per apartment unit in  and per apartment unit in capital resources and liquidity capital resources we intend to pursue our growth strategy through the utilization of our flexible capital structure 
this may include the issuance of operating partnership units  common stock and or preferred stock  additional debt  and joint venture investments 
we may use our lines of credit or fixed rate  long term debt to acquire apartment communities 
long term debt as of december   all of our properties were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt 
as of december   total long term debt was million  including million of notes payable at fixed interest rates ranging from to  and million at variable rates indexed on day libor rates 
the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding at december   was  compared to at december  this reduction is primarily due to declines in variable rates during at our current level of variable rate debt  a fluctuation in variable interest rates would increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately in december  we modified and expanded our previously established revolving line of credit with a bank secured by latitudes apartments 
we were able to increase this line based on the lender s estimate of the appreciated fair market value of the property 
our line of credit arrangements are now as follows o million  secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due november interest only payments on the outstanding balance are due monthly at a variable interest rate of day libor plus 
at december   the outstanding balance on this line was million 
as of march   the outstanding balance on this line was million  with approximately million available under this revolving line of credit 
o million  secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of restaurant properties  due january interest only payments on the outstanding balance are due monthly at a variable interest rate of day libor plus 
the available line of credit declined to million effective january  and we retired an additional  of this debt upon sale of a restaurant property in february at december   the outstanding balance on this line was million 
as of march   the outstanding balance on this line was million  the current maximum amount 
in february  we completed refinancing for oakbrook apartments  with a million note payable with interest at and maturity in february this deed of trust note replaced an existing note with a balance of million  with the balance of proceeds applied to reduce our latitudes line of credit 
oakbrook was our second apartment community  acquired in june for an initial acquisition cost of million 
in replacing the financing on oakbrook apartments  we were able to substantially increase the loan amount based on the lender s estimate of the appreciated fair market value of the property 
we applied excess proceeds of this fixed rate loan to reduce the outstanding balance on our variable rate lines of credit 
we utilized long term debt  along with draws on our lines of credit  to finance acquisitions of apartment communities in as follows o in september  we acquired alta harbour apartments for a total cost of approximately million 
we financed this acquisition with a million fixed rate note payable  secured by a deed of trust on the community  along with million proceeds from issuance of preferred stock and draws on our line of credit secured by latitudes apartments 
o in may  we acquired barrington place apartments and brookford place apartments for a total cost of approximately million 
we financed these acquisitions by assuming the million balance of a fixed rate deed of trust loan for barrington place  by issuing a million fixed rate deed of trust loan for brookford place  by issuing operating partnership units with an imputed value of approximately million  and draws on our line of credit secured by latitudes apartments 
we also utilized our line of credit secured by latitudes to fund capital improvements at our apartment communities 
a summary of scheduled principal payments on long term debt is included in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the notes to the financial statements in this annual report 
significant scheduled balloon payments include maturities of o our line of credit secured by deeds of trust and assignment of rents of restaurants  due january million outstanding at december   o our line of credit secured by a deed of trust and assignment of rents of latitudes apartments  due november up to million  million outstanding at december   o our deed of trust loan for oak hollow apartments phase  due december up to million for acquisition and renovation construction  million outstanding at december   and o our deed of trust loan for harris hill apartments  due june million outstanding at december  
capital stock and operating partnership units at december   we had approximately million common shares and approximately  preferred shares outstanding 
in addition  there were approximately million operating partnership common units 
in late december  we issued  shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock to a single investor for proceeds of million 
in september  we issued an additional  shares of this preferred stock to the same investor for additional proceeds of million 
the preferred shares have a purchase price and liquidation preference of per share  an initial dividend yield of through december  and may be converted to our common stock on a one for one basis after three years 
during  we issued approximately  shares of our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we generally applied these proceeds to capital expenditures at apartment communities 
all of the operating partnership units held by minority interest owners were issued in through in conjunction with acquisitions of apartment communities 
holders of operating partnership units generally are able to redeem their units for cash or  at our option  for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis after one year from issuance 
cash flows and liquidity net cash flows from operating activities were million in  million in  and million in investing and financing activities focused primarily on apartment acquisitions and capital expenditures at apartment communities  along with payments of dividends and distributions 
we paid dividends of per share per quarter in each quarter of  and our payout ratio the ratio of dividends plus distributions paid to operating partnership funds from operations was in  in  and in we intend to pay dividends quarterly  expect that these dividends will substantially exceed the distribution requirement for reits  and anticipate that all dividends will be paid from current funds from operations 
in january  we announced we were reducing the quarterly dividend to per share 
our decision to reduce the dividend should not be viewed as an indication that we are concerned about the long term financial viability of the company  for we clearly generate sufficient cash flow to meet the day to day operating needs of the company and to pay a dividend 
the question is  given current market conditions and the outlook for the near term future  how large should the dividend be 
while we are not philosophically opposed to paying dividends that temporarily exceed current cash flow after operating expenses  this would only occur when we were confident that we would see significant improvement in operations in a relatively short period of time 
in view of our somewhat negative outlook for  we came to the conclusion that prudence required a reduction in our dividend 
we generally expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and utilization of credit facilities 
we believe that net cash provided by operations is  and will continue to be  adequate to meet the reit operating requirements in both the short and the long term 
we anticipate funding our future acquisition activities primarily by using short term credit facilities as an interim measure  to be replaced by funds from equity offerings  long term debt  or joint venture investments 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and repayment of short term financing of possible property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of debt securities or additional equity securities 
we believe we have sufficient resources to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
we received approximately of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in  from rent received from boddie noell enterprises for the use of our restaurant properties 
in addition  enterprises is responsible for all of the costs associated with the maintenance and operations of these properties 
over time  we expect that restaurant rental income will continue to represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue 
under our current line of credit agreement  enterprises has the right to purchase  under specified terms  one additional restaurant deemed non economic  for no less than net carrying value 
if that were to happen  the annual minimum rent would be reduced by approximately  we would receive sale proceeds of the greater of net carrying value or fair value 
as of december   the average net book value of the restaurant properties was approximately  as in the past  we would most likely apply sale proceeds to reduce outstanding debt on our line of credit 
enterprises is a privately owned company with total assets exceeding million and net equity exceeding million 
its principal line of business is the operation of approximately hardee s restaurants 
in addition to its hardee s operations  enterprises is the owner of texas steakhouse and saloon  a casual dining concept with restaurants 
enterprises also conducts extensive real estate investment and development activities through bne land and development 
these activities involve a full range of property types  including land  commercial  retail  office  apartment and single family properties 
we have had extensive discussions with management of enterprises and have reviewed their financial statements  cash flow analysis  restaurant contribution analysis  sales trend analysis and forecasts 
we believe that enterprises will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its obligations under the master lease as well as its general corporate operating needs 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are identified and discussed in the notes to our financial statements included in this annual report 
those policies that may be of particular interest to readers of this annual report are further discussed below 
capital expenditures and depreciation in general  for acquired apartment properties  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over composite estimated useful lives of the related assets  generally years for buildings  years for land improvements  years for fixtures and equipment  and five years for floor coverings 
for the acquisitions of barrington place  brookford place and alta harbour apartments in  we performed detailed analyses of components of the real estate assets acquired 
for these properties  we assigned estimated useful lives as follows land improvements  years  short lived building components  years  base building structure  years  and fixtures  equipment and floor coverings  years 
we generally complete and capitalize acquisition improvements expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which are intended to position the property consistent with our physical standards within one to two years of acquisition 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize recurring capital expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of existing assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate these additions and replacements on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of years 
we retire replaced assets with a charge to depreciation for any remaining carrying value 
we capitalize all floor covering  appliance  and hvac replacements  and depreciate them using a straight line  group method over estimated useful lives of years 
capital expenditures at our apartment communities during totaled approximately million  including million for acquisition improvements  million for additions and betterments  and million in recurring capital expenditures 
we expense ordinary repairs and maintenance costs at apartment communities 
repairs and maintenance at our apartment communities during totaled approximately million  including million in compensation of service staff and million in payments for materials and contracted services 
costs of repairs  maintenance  and capital replacements and improvements at restaurant properties are borne by the lessee 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review our real estate assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered from their undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if the carrying value were to be greater than the undiscounted future operating cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount is not recoverable 
our estimates of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties  including  among others  demand for apartment units  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the undiscounted future operating cash flows that we estimate in our impairment analyses may not be achieved  and it is possible that we could be required to recognize impairment losses on our properties at some point in the future 
revenue recognition we record rental and other income monthly as it is earned 
we record rental payments that we receive prior to the first of a given month as prepaid rent 
we hold tenant security deposits in trust in bank accounts separate from operating cash these amounts are included in other current assets on our balance sheet  and we record a corresponding liability for security deposits on our balance sheet inflation we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to the company 
the leases at our apartment properties are short term in nature 
none are longer than two years 
the restaurant properties are leased on a triple net basis  which places the risk of rising operating and maintenance costs on the lessee 
environmental matters phase i environmental studies performed on the apartment communities when we acquired each of them did not identify any problems that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
environmental transaction screens for each of the restaurant properties in did not indicate existence of any environmental problems that warranted further investigation 
enterprises has indemnified us under the master lease for environmental problems associated with the restaurant properties 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
statement will generally require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations  rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under statement we plan to adopt statement effective january  upon adoption  the extraordinary items for loss on early extinguishment of debt that we have reported in and earlier will be reclassified to conform to statement while adoption of statement will have no impact on net income  it will reduce income before extraordinary items and eliminate extraordinary items as previously reported 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which changes the accounting for and disclosure of certain guarantees 
beginning with transactions entered into after december   certain guarantees must be recorded at fair value  which is different from prior practice  under which a liability was recorded only when a loss was probable and reasonably estimable 
in general  the change applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the company to make payments to a guaranteed third party based on changes in an underlying asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
we plan to adopt this interpretation effective january   and we do not expect this adoption to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations
