table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains a discussion of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to its consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped and title or risk of loss resides with unaffiliated customers  and at which time the appropriate provisions are recorded for estimated contractual chargeback credits from the manufacturers based on the company s contract with the manufacturer 
rebates and allowances are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the period they are received from the vendor or manufacturer unless such rebates and allowances are reasonably estimable at the end of a reporting period 
the company records chargeback credits due from its vendors in the period when the sale is made to the customer which is eligible for contract pricing from the manufacturer 
the company accepts return of product from its customers for product which is saleable  in unopened containers and carries a current date 
generally  product returns are received via the company s own delivery vehicles  thereby eliminating a direct shipping cost from being incurred by the customer or the company 
depending on the length of time the customer has held the product  the company may charge a handling and restocking fee 
overall  the percentage of the return of product to the company is extremely low 
the company has no sales incentive or rebate programs with its customers 
inventory valuation inventory is stated at the lower of cost of market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out basis of accounting 
inventories consist of brand and generic drugs  over the counter products  health and beauty aids  and nutritional supplements for resale 
the inventories of the company s three distribution centers are constantly monitored for out of date or damaged products  which if exist  are reclassed and physically relocated out of saleable inventory to a holding area  referred to as the morgue inventory  for return to and credit from the manufacturer 
however  if market acceptance of the company s existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  inventory write downs could be required 
as of march   and  no inventory valuation allowances were necessary 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
in addition  upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 the company ceased amortization of goodwill effective april  and reviews goodwill annually for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
thereafter  the value of goodwill cannot be greater than the excess of the fair value of the company s reportable unit over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities  based on the annual impairment test 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a diminution in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
periodically  the company evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying value of its property and equipment  by comparing the carrying values to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
a deficiency in these cash flows relative to the carrying amounts is an indication of the need for a 
table of contents write down due to impairment 
the impairment write down would be the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these assets 
losses on impairments are recognized by a charge to earnings 
allowance for deferred income tax asset the company had a deferred income tax asset and valuation allowance at march   which primarily represented the potential future tax benefit associated with its operating losses through the fiscal year ended march  in assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management evaluated the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liability  the company s profitability for the year ended march   reviewed the company s business model  and future earnings projections  and believes the evidence indicates that the company will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred income tax asset 
based upon the evaluations made  management concluded that realization of the deferred income tax asset was more likely than not  therefore  the valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a deferred income tax benefit of approximately 
million related to losses reported for the fiscal year  and has recorded a valuation allowance of 
million for a portion of deferred tax assets which management concluded that their realization was not more likely than not

results of operations revenues the company generated revenues of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  which represents an increase of approximately million or for fiscal year over fiscal year  and an increase of approximately million or for fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in revenues is a direct result of aggressive marketing  expanded sales efforts and cross selling to common customers  and the company s commitment to expand its generic and over the counter and other products lines

the company currently has three distribution centers  all of which were acquired as follows in november  the company acquired becan and its subsidiary  discount  in april  the company acquired valley  and in october  the company acquired penner 
thus  while fiscal years and include full year sales for all three distribution centers  prior years do not 
for example  fiscal year consists of full year sales for the pennsylvania distribution center acquired when the company purchased becan  but only approximately eleven months of sales for the ohio distribution center acquired when the company purchased valley and approximately seven months of sales for the louisiana distribution center which is the period of time the company managed penner prior to the company s acquisition of penner in october
