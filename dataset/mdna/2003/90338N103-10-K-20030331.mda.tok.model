actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
recognition of revenue for financial reporting purposes  the company generally recognizes revenue and direct costs when shipments are completed 
certain revenue of xpress global systems  representing less than of consolidated revenues  are recognized upon manifest 
manifest refers to the time when the trailer of the independent carrier is loaded  sealed and ready to leave the dock 
estimated expenses are recorded simultaneous to the recognition of revenue 
goodwill the excess of the consideration paid by the company over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and has been amortized on the straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
the company evaluated whether subsequent events and circumstances have occurred that indicated the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill might warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicated that goodwill should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company used an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the related businesses over the remaining life of the goodwill in measuring whether goodwill is recoverable 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized  and that amounts recorded as goodwill are to be tested for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective january  application of the provisions of sfas no 
decreased amortization expense by approximately million 
the company tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures impairment  if any 
the company completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and noted no impairment of goodwill in claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals consist of cargo loss  damage  liability personal injury and property damage and workers compensation claims within the company s established retention levels 
claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts the company considers adequate 
claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims at december  and  plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims 
accruals for cargo loss  damage  liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on the company s evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims 
factors that may affect future results the trucking industry is affected by economic risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond its control 
these include economic recessions and downturns in customers business cycles  increases in fuel prices  the availability of qualified drivers and fluctuations in interest rates 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes numerous regional  inter regional and national truckload carriers 
some of these carriers have greater financial resources  equipment and freight capacity than the company 
management believes its strategies of controlled growth and focused marketing will provide freight at sufficient volumes and prices to be profitable 
changes in economic conditions could reduce both the amount of freight available and freight rates  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
shortages of fuel or significant increases in fuel prices could have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
substantially all of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel the company recognized million of fuel surcharge revenue for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in 
however  fuel surcharges to customers do not fully recover all of fuel increases due to engine idle time and out of route miles not billable to the customer 
additionally  at times  fuel purchase contracts are used to mitigate the effects of increases in the prices of fuel 
during the first quarter of  fuel prices steadily increased and are at significantly higher levels than these increased fuel costs will have an impact on fiscal operations to the extent that they are not offset by higher rates and surcharges 
competition for available qualified drivers in the truckload industry is intense and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future 
the company and many of its competitors experience high rates of turnover and occasionally have difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers in sufficient numbers to operate all available equipment 
management believes the company s current pay structure  benefits  policies and procedures related to drivers are effective in attracting and retaining drivers 
however  there can be no assurance that it will not be affected by a shortage of qualified drivers in the future 
the inability to attract and retain qualified drivers would have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the trucking industry is extremely capital intensive 
the company depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flows from operations to finance the expansion and maintenance of its modern and cost efficient revenue equipment and facilities 
at present  the company is more highly leveraged than some of its competitors 
if the company were unable in the future to obtain financing at acceptable levels  it could be forced to limit the growth or replacement of its equipment and facilities 
a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results 
the company is self insured for cargo loss  damage  liability personal injury and property damage and workers compensation claims within the company s established retention levels 
the current retention level per occurrence is  for cargo loss and  for workers compensation 
the first retention level for liability is  per claim 
the company also carries the risk for the million to million level of cost per occurrence 
if the number of claims or severity of claims for which the company is self insured increases from historical levels  operating results could be adversely affected 
also  the company maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above the amounts for which it is self insured 
after several years of aggressive pricing  insurance carriers have raised premiums  which have increased the company s insurance and claims expense 
if these expenses continue to increase and the company is unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates  earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation dot 
the dot has broad powers and generally governs activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and other matters 
the company may be subjected to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other items mandated by the dot 
for example  new engine emissions standards became effective for truck engine manufacturers in october these new engines have not been available for adequate testing and are expected to be more costly and less fuel efficient 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources during were funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit and equipment installment notes  proceeds from sales of used revenue equipment and the use of long term operating leases for revenue equipment acquisitions 
in december  the company entered into approximately million in equipment installment notes  the proceeds of which were used primarily to reduce borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
in connection therewith  the company s revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks was amended 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the facility was reduced from million to million  and the maturity date was extended to july on march   the company entered into a new million senior secured revolving credit facility 
proceeds from this new facility were used to repay the then existing revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to million  with availability at any given time based on specified percentages of eligible receivables and revenue equipment  less reserves  under the facility s borrowing base formula 
letters of credit under the facility are limited to million 
the facility matures in march the facility allows the company to select interest rates for all or any portion of the outstanding balance  based on either a base rate based on the domestic prime rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin ranges from to for base rate loans and from to for libor loans  based in each case on the aggregate availability as defined 
at december   the applicable margin was for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the facility also prescribes additional fees for letter of credit transactions and a monthly commitment fee based on the difference between the total commitment and the total borrowing capacity utilized by the company from time to time 
at december   million in borrowings and million in letters of credit were outstanding under the facility with million available to borrow 
the facility is secured by substantially all assets of the company  other than real estate and assets securing equipment installment notes and other debt of the company 
the existing line of credit facility requires  among other things  maintenance by the company of prescribed minimum amounts of consolidated tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratios and leverage ratios 
it also i limits the company s future capital expenditures  ii prohibits all acquisitions by the company of its own capital stock or the payment of dividends on such stock  and iii effectively prohibits future asset acquisitions or dispositions except in the ordinary course of business or other business combination transactions by the company without the lenders consent 
in  the company s primary sources of liquidity are expected to be funds provided by operations  borrowings under lines of credit  proceeds from sale of used revenue equipment and equipment installment notes and long term operating lease financing for the acquisition of revenue equipment 
cash generated from operations increased to million in from million in net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in this increase was due primarily to a decrease in the purchases of new equipment and a corresponding decrease in sales of used revenue equipment as the company has extended the trade cycle of its revenue equipment 
in  million was used to acquire additional property and equipment  compared to million in in  property and equipment additions consisted of  primarily  tractors purchased out of lease and new tractors and trailers 
net cash used in financing activities was million in and million in net repayments of long term debt were million during  compared to million in management believes that funds provided by operations  borrowings under its lines of credit  equipment installment loans and long term operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through the following table represents the company s outstanding contractual obligations at december  excluding letters of credit of  outstanding at december  the letters of credit are maintained primarily to support the company s insurance program and are renewed on an annual basis 
payments due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases revenue equipment operating leases other total contractual cash obligations inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition during the past three years 
however  inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the company s future results 
seasonality in the trucking industry  shipments generally show a seasonal pattern as customers increase shipments prior to and reduce shipments during and after the winter holiday season 
additionally  shipments can be adversely impacted by winter weather conditions 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds sfas  which required all material gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  upon adoption extinguishment gains and losses will be classified as ordinary gains or losses in the income statement 
additionally  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods should be reclassified to ordinary gain or loss in comparative income statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the adoption of sfas no 
will require the company to reclassify the extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of  net of tax  as an ordinary loss on the income statement as mentioned above 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
severance pay under statement no 
 in many cases  will be recognized over time rather than up front 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
statement no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the company s summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the statement does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
certain disclosure requirements of sfas no 
became effective for the company for the year ended december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statement nos 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december   and are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s variable rate debt 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
the company has interest rate swap agreements which convert floating rates to fixed rates for a total notional amount of million  of which million expired february and the remaining million expires september if interest rates on the company s existing variable rate debt  after considering interest rate swaps  were to increase by from their december  rates for the next twelve months  there would be no material adverse impact on the company s results of operations related to existing debt obligations 
commodity price risk fuel is one of the company s largest expenditures 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside the company s control 
many of the company s customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel 
however  there is no assurance that such fuel surcharges could be used to offset future increases in fuel prices
