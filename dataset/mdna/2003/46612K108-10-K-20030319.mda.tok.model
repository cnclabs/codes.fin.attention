item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of sophisticated software solutions designed specifically to address the demand and supply chain management  business process  decision support  e commerce  inventory optimization  and collaborative planning and forecasting requirements of the retail industry and its suppliers 
our solutions enable our customers to collect  manage  organize and analyze information throughout their retail enterprise  and to collaborate with suppliers and customers over the internet at multiple levels within their organization 
we also offer maintenance services to our software customers  and enhance and support our software business by offering retail specific services that are designed to enable our clients to rapidly achieve the benefits of our solutions 
these services include project management  system planning  system design and implementation  custom configurations  and training services 
demand for our implementation services is driven by  and often trails  sales of our software products 
consulting services revenues are generally more predictable but generate lower gross margins than software license revenues 
significant trends and developments in our business economic conditions 
we believe the retail industry remains cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the current difficult economic cycle  perhaps due to poor macroeconomic conditions  and uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and of a us war with iraq 
in addition  subsequent to the september attack and the ensuing deterioration in economic conditions  we believe retailers changed their buying behavior and this resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell away from high dollar projects toward lower cost point solutions 
we remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions  and the disappointing results of retailers in certain of our geographic regions 
the retail industry will be adversely impacted if negative economic conditions or fear of a war with iraq or additional terrorists attacks persist for an extended period of time 
weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  elongate our selling cycles  and delay  suspend or reduce the demand for our products 
as a result  it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close within a six to nine month time frame 
in addition  we believe that pricing pressure has increased in response to the economic downturn  which could cause us to offer more significant discounts  or in some cases to lose potential business to competitors willing to offer what we believe to be overly aggressive discounts 
further  weak and uncertain economic conditions could cause a deterioration of our customers creditworthiness in the future and impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services or cause an increase in bankruptcy filings in our customer base 
any of these factors could adversely impact our business  quarterly or annual operating results and financial condition 
impact of the e corporation acquisition 
in september we completed the acquisition of e corporation e for a total cost of million  which includes million in cash and the exchange of  shares of our unregistered common stock for all of the outstanding stock of e held by the former shareholders of e  as well as 
table of contents million in fees and direct costs associated with the acquisition and million in restructuring costs to exit certain activities of e the e product suite included inventory optimization systems such as etrim  a warehouse and distribution center forecasting and replenishment solution  and eslim  a store level forecasting and replenishment solution  advanced analytic solutions such as consumer outlook  a data mining application for consumer behavior patterns  and pin point  an application that refines seasonal profile assignments  and certain collaborative planning  forecasting and replenishment cpfr solutions  which today include trading partners worldwide that are live and operational on applications that enable manufacturers  distributors and retailers to work from a single  shared demand forecast 
we believe that due to the acquisition of e in  we are now the leading provider of inventory replenishment solutions to retailers and their suppliers 
importantly  nearly of e s client base is non retail and we have accelerated our cpfr initiatives by gaining an immediate presence in the wholesale and distribution industries that we had already targeted for growth 
total revenues in our collaborative solutions business segment increased in compared to  primarily because of the new products that e had developed for this evolving market 
excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  product revenues  consulting services revenues  and total revenues decreased  and  respectively in compared to new products and expanded markets 
we invested million in  and approximately million in the last five years from to in new product development and the acquisition of complimentary products while remaining profitable and cash flow positive from operations 
we released enhanced versions of our core software products during the past two years and introduced new value added web based applications such as store portal  affinity and marketing expense management 
in addition  the acquisitions of intactix  zapotec  neovista decision series and e expanded our product offerings and provided us with collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers 
the collaborative solutions business segment  which includes sales of software license and services to customers outside the retail market  provided of our total revenues in compared to in we have experienced increased sales activity in the last two years from larger retail customers with annual sales in excess of billion that we expect will continue to contribute to our revenue in future periods 
we believe our strategy of expanding our product portfolio and increasing the scalability of our products has been the key element in attracting larger retail customers  and we believe that it has resulted in a steady pattern of new customers licensing multiple products  as well as enhanced back selling opportunities in our install base 
in april we acquired certain intellectual property of j commerce inc j commerce  a privately held canadian corporation  for a total cost of million  which includes the purchase price of million plus  in direct costs of the acquisition 
j commerce developed point of sale software solutions based on java technology 
we are developing a portfolio point of sales application that combines the j commerce point of sale software technology with our internet based store portal application to provide a complimentary product strategy with win dss for larger retail customers that have annual sales in excess of billion and or a large number of stores and or registers per store 
the acquisition  which is not material to our financial position or operating results  was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly  the operating results of j commerce have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in connection with the j commerce acquisition  we expensed  of purchased in process research and development in second quarter  and recorded approximately million of goodwill in our in store systems reporting unit  and million of developed software technology 
we lowered our consulting services revenue outlook 
consulting services revenue  including the reclassification of reimbursed expenses  decreased in compared to excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  consulting services revenues including the reclassification of reimbursed expenses  decreased  in compared to primarily due to a decrease in demand for the implementation of portfolio merchandise management systems and other large projects 
consulting services revenue typically lags the sale of software licenses by as much as one year 
in addition  we believe the average implementation times for our software products have declined due to increased training and expertise in our consulting organization  and as a direct result of the investments we have made over the past few years to increase the functionality  stability  scalability  integration and ease of implementation of the products in the jda portfolio 
furthermore  in more of the demand for our products was associated with our strategic merchandise management solutions that require lower levels of services to implement 
as a result of these changes in our business and product revenue mix  our consulting services revenue has declined sequentially in each of the last four quarters and we expect consulting services revenue and margins to continue to decline until the demand for 
table of contents portfolio merchandise management systems and the related implementation services returns  or until economic conditions improve 
consulting services margins in were  which is flat compared to lower utilization in was offset by lower incentive compensation payments and higher average billing rates compared to the lower utilization rates in resulted from deteriorating economic conditions that have decreased the overall demand for our services  the decrease in demand for portfolio merchandise management systems and other high dollar projects  as well as improved integration and reduced implementation timeframes for products in the jda portfolio 
during second quarter we reduced our consulting services headcount by approximately in order to stem the decline in our utilization rates  consulting margins and overall profitability with the lower consulting services revenue outlook for during fourth quarter  we further reduced our consulting services headcount by another in connection with our reorganization and restructuring of the company see we recorded restructuring charges to reorganize our company and to re align our cost structure 
strong financial position and operating cash flow 
we continue to maintain a strong financial position with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and no debt 
in addition  during we generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
we recorded restructuring charges to reorganize our company and to re align our cost structure 
we consistently monitor the impact of the economic environment on the outlook for demand for our products and services  and make adjustments to our workforce as necessary to maintain overall profitability 
in second quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge for a workforce reduction of full time employees  primarily in the consulting services function in the americas and europe 
all employees potentially impacted by this restructuring were notified of the plan of termination and the related benefits on or before june  in fourth quarter  we recorded another restructuring charge of million for termination and office closure costs associated with the reorganization of the company to implement the cvp initiative 
the implementation of cvp will allow us to reallocate our resources in response to a fundamental shift in the way we develop product and bring it to market  as well as to changes in the demand for the various types of products we sell  the length of implementation efforts required and associated skill requirements 
in addition  the related workforce reduction will enable us to better align our cost structure during the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted our revenues  elongated our selling cycles  and delayed  suspended or reduced the demand for certain of our products 
the reorganization will result in the consolidation of nearly all product development activities at our corporate headquarters  a workforce reduction of approximately full time employees fte and certain office closures 
the workforce reduction includes certain employees involved in product development fte and client support services fte who choose not to relocate  and reductions in consulting services personnel fte  sales and marketing personnel fte  and administrative functions fte 
we currently expect to hire replacements for approximately fte in product development and client support services to replace those individuals who choose not to relocate to our corporate headquarters 
we expect to reduce our annual fixed operating costs by approximately million to million through this reorganization and restructuring effort 
all employees potentially impacted by this reorganization initiative were notified of the plan of termination and the related benefits on or before december  office closure costs pertain to certain us  latin america  and european offices that were either under performing or became redundant with the relocation initiatives 
we also incurred  in costs through december   in connection with cvp  to relocate certain product development and client support services employees based in offices around the united states and the united kingdom to our corporate headquarters  and we expect to incur an additional million to million in relocation costs during to complete this consolidation 
the relocation costs will be reported in income from continuing operations as they are incurred 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets 
table of contents and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting  training and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  during first quarter sab provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our licensing or revenue recognition practices 
software license revenue is recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
the undelivered elements are primarily training  consulting and maintenance services 
vsoe of fair value for training and consulting services is based upon standard hourly rates charged when those services are sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is the price the customer will be required to pay when it is sold separately that is  the renewal rate 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
payments for our software licenses are typically due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
although infrequent  where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
consulting and training services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training are billed on both an hourly basis and under fixed price contracts 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
training revenues are recognized when the training is provided and is included in consulting revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
under fixed price contracts  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
we have from time to time provided software and consulting services under fixed price contracts that require the achievement of certain milestones and payment terms in these contracts are generally tied to customer acceptance of the milestones 
the revenue under such arrangements is recognized as the milestones are achieved or upon customer acceptance 
we believe that milestones are a proper measure of progress under these contracts  as the milestones approximate the percentage of completion method of accounting 
customer support services include post contract support and the rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support services are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or on an annual basis with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fees are allocated to the various elements based upon vsoe of fair value  as described above 
accounts receivable 
consistent with industry practice and to be competitive in the retail software marketplace  we typically provide installment payment terms on most software license sales 
software licenses are generally due 
table of contents in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
all significant customers are reviewed for creditworthiness before the company licenses its software and we do not sell our software or recognize any license revenue unless we believe that collection is probable in accordance with the requirements of paragraph in sop we have a history of collecting software payments when they come due without providing refunds or concessions 
consulting services are billed bi weekly and maintenance services are billed annually or monthly 
if a customer becomes significantly delinquent or its credit deteriorates  we put the accounts on hold and do not recognize any further services revenue and in most cases we withdraw support and or our implementation staff until the situation has been resolved 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
although infrequent and unpredictable  from time to time certain of our customers have filed bankruptcy and we have been required to refund the pre petition amounts collected and settle for less than the face value of its remaining receivable pursuant to a bankruptcy court order 
in these situations  as soon as it becomes probable that the net realizable value of the receivable is impaired  we provide reserves on the receivable 
in addition  we monitor economic conditions in the various geographic regions in which it operates to determine if general reserves or adjustments to its credit policy in a region are appropriate for deteriorating conditions that may impact the net realizable value of our receivables 
intangible assets 
our business combinations typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affects the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and annual assessments for impairment requires management to make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide any necessary allowances as required 
stock based compensation 
we do not record compensation expense for options granted to our employees as all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide pro forma disclosure on an annual basis of net income loss and net income loss per common share for employee stock option grants made as if the fair value method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
effective january  in addition to requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   sfas no 
also provides guidance on the types of acquired intangible assets that are to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
we reclassified the unamortized balance of our assembled workforce asset of approximately  to goodwill on january  pursuant to certain transitional provisions of sfas no 
that apply to the business combinations we completed and accounted for under the purchase method prior to july  we also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
addresses how intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
sfas no 
also requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
upon adoption  we ceased amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets we recorded in business combinations prior to june  the application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
reduced amortization expense by approximately million in  increasing net income by approximately million 
during the year ended december  we recorded million in goodwill in connection with our acquisition of certain intellectual property of j commerce inc we also recorded an additional million in goodwill during as a 
table of contents result of certain final adjustments made to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of e in september and a reduction in the amount of deferred tax asset recorded on this transaction to reflect our revised estimate of the anticipated future tax benefits from acquisition costs incurred and research and development credits 
no goodwill was impaired or written off during the year ended december  as of december   goodwill has been allocated to our reporting units as follows million to retail enterprise systems  million to in store systems  and million to collaborative solutions 
sfas no 
required that we test goodwill for impairment as of january  and any resulting impairment charge be reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we completed the initial test for goodwill impairment during the three month period ended march  and completed our annual test for goodwill impairment during fourth quarter we found no indication of impairment of the goodwill allocated to the individual reporting units 
accordingly  absent future indications of impairment  the next annual impairment test will be performed in fourth quarter we reassessed the useful lives of intangible assets other than goodwill during the three month period ended march  and during fourth quarter except for trademarks  no adjustments have been made to the useful lives of our intangible assets 
substantially all of our capitalized trademarks were acquired in connection with the acquisition of e we do not believe the expected useful life of the e trademarks is directly tied to another asset or group of assets  however  we did acquire software technology and customer lists in connection with the e acquisition 
although the underlying software technology and customer install base may change and evolve over time  we intend to indefinitely develop next generation products under the e trademark 
beginning january   we assigned indefinite useful lives to our e trademarks  and ceased amortization  as we believe there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic  or other factors that would limit the useful life of our trademarks and we expect the trademarks to contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we completed an initial impairment test on trademarks during the three month period ended march  and our annual test for impairment during fourth quarter we found no indication of impairment during the year ended december  accordingly  absent future indications of impairment  the next annual impairment test will be performed in fourth quarter in fourth quarter  we reviewed the customer attrition rates for each significant acquired customer group to ensure that the rate of attrition is not increasing and that revisions to our estimates of life expectancy for our customer lists are not required 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and supersedes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting of the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
requires that we evaluate long lived assets based on the net future cash flow expected to be generated from the asset on an undiscounted basis whenever significant events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our operating results or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

the provisions of sfas no

eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 the liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities is recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date the company committed to the exit plan 
we recorded restructuring  asset disposition  and other merger related charges in the second and fourth quarters of  and in and  using the authoritative guidance in eitf no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred effective january  eitf no 
requires the reclassification of reimbursed expenses in both service revenues and cost of service revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
we previously netted reimbursed expenses in the cost of services 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not impact our total gross profit or operating income  but it did increase service revenues and cost of service revenues  and as a result  slightly reduces our gross profit margin and operating margin percentages 
reimbursed expenses of million have been classified in both service revenues and cost of service revenues for the year ended december   and we have reclassified reimbursed expenses of million and million to service revenues and cost of service revenues in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no

software license revenues for decreased to million from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  software license revenues decreased in compared to the retail industry appears to remain cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the current difficult economic cycle  perhaps due to poor macroeconomic conditions  and uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and a us war with iraq

consulting services consulting services revenue  including the reclassification of reimbursed expenses  decreased in to million from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  consulting services revenue decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in demand for the implementation of portfolio merchandise management systems and other large projects 
consulting services revenue typically lags the sale of software licenses by as much as one year

furthermore  in more of the demand for our products was associated with our analytic and optimization products that require lower levels of services to implement 
as a result of these changes in our business and product revenue mix  our consulting services revenue has declined sequentially in each of the last four quarters and we expect consulting services revenue and margins to continue to decline until the demand for portfolio merchandise management systems and the related implementation services returns  or until economic conditions improve 

table of contents business segment revenues total revenues in our retail enterprise systems business segment decreased to million in from million in excluding the impact of owning e for eight more months in than in  total revenues in this business segment decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decline in demand for portfolio merchandise management systems 
sales of portfolio merchandise management systems tend to be more heavily impacted during slow economic periods  as retailers are often reluctant to make substantial investments due to the slower expected return on investment 
in addition  these products typically have longer implementation time frames and our services group often performs the implementation services 
as a result  the decline in software sales for these products is also having a negative impact on our consulting services revenue 
the retail enterprise systems business segment represented of our total revenues in compared to in total revenues in our in store systems business segment decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a decrease in win dss revenues  offset in part by a increase in revenues from the store portal application

consulting services margins  which include the reclassification of reimbursed expenses in both service revenues and cost of service revenues  remained flat at in compared to as the impact of the decrease in average consulting services headcount  lower incentive compensation costs and higher average billing rates in compared to were offset by lower utilization rates 
the lower utilization rates in are a result of deteriorating economic conditions that have decreased the demand for our services  particularly from portfolio merchandise management systems implementations and other large projects  together with improved integration and shorter implementation timeframes of the products in the jda portfolio 
during second quarter we reduced our consulting services headcount by approximately in order to stem the decline in our utilization rates  consulting margins and overall profitability with the lower consulting services revenue outlook for during fourth quarter we reduced our consulting services headcount by another in connection with our reorganization and restructuring of the company see we recorded restructuring charges to reorganize our company and to re align our cost structure 
however  we do not expect any significant improvements in our consulting margins until the second half of  and that is dependent to a large extent  upon the return of demand for our portfolio merchandise management systems

restructuring  asset disposition and other merger related charges 
we consistently monitor the impact of the economic environment on the outlook for demand for our products and services  and make adjustments to our workforce as necessary to maintain overall profitability 
in second quarter  we recorded a million restructuring charge for a workforce reduction of full time employees  primarily in the consulting services function in the americas and europe 
all employees potentially impacted by this restructuring were notified of the plan of termination and the related benefits on or before june  in fourth quarter  we recorded another restructuring charge of million for termination and office closure costs associated with the reorganization of the company to implement the cvp initiative 
the implementation of cvp will allow us to reallocate our resources in response to a fundamental shift in the way we develop product and bring it to market  as well as to changes in the demand for the various types of products we sell  the length of implementation efforts required and associated skill requirements 
in addition  the related workforce reduction will enable us to better align our cost structure during the current economic downturn  which has adversely impacted our revenues  elongated our selling cycles  and delayed  suspended or reduced the demand for certain of our products 
the reorganization will result in the consolidation of nearly all product development activities at our corporate headquarters  a workforce reduction of approximately full time employees fte and certain office closures 
the workforce reduction includes certain employees involved in product development fte and client support services fte who choose not to relocate  and reductions in consulting services personnel fte  sales and marketing personnel fte  and administrative functions fte 
we currently expect to hire replacements for approximately fte in product development and client support services to replace those individuals who choose not to relocate to our corporate headquarters

in the tentative settlement  the internal revenue service agreed to allow the company to take a research and development expense tax credit for most of the qualifying expenses originally reported in the company s corporate income tax returns for those years 
our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income  domestically by state and internationally by country  and available income tax credits 
the provisions for income taxes for and do not include the tax benefits realized from employee stock options exercised during these years of  net of a  valuation allowance  and  respectively 
these tax benefits reduce our income tax liabilities and are included as an increase to additional paid in capital 
during  we established a valuation allowance of  on foreign tax credit carryovers because we have been operating in an excess credit position 
we charged  of this valuation allowance to additional paid in capital due to the potential loss of foreign tax credits from the exercise of employee stock options 
we feel it is more likely than not that foreign tax credits will not be realized 
if  in the future  the company determines that it is able to utilize the foreign tax credits  a portion of the valuation allowance reversal will be recorded to additional paid in capital

table of contents we believe there are opportunities to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary and synergistic companies  products and technologies 
we look for acquisitions that can be readily integrated and accretive to earnings  although we may pursue smaller non accretive acquisitions that will shorten our time to market with new technologies 
we believe the general size of cash acquisitions we would currently consider to be in the million to million range 
any material acquisition could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
in addition  any material acquisitions of complementary or synergistic companies  products or technologies could require that we obtain additional equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us and would not result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in july  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
under this repurchase program  we may periodically repurchase common shares during a one year period ending july  on the open market at prevailing market prices 
as of december   we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under this program 
our board of directors previously authorized a stock repurchase program in october for the purchase of up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock over a one year period that ended october  we purchased a total of  shares under this program during and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and funds generated from operations will provide adequate liquidity to meet our normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of these risks and uncertainties that we believe may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and contained elsewhere in this form k 
regional and or global changes in economic  political and market conditions could cause decreases in demand for our software and related services which could negatively affect our revenue and operating results and the market price of our stock 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our software and related services 
a regional and or global change in the economy and financial markets could result in delay or cancellation of customer purchases 
we and most of our competitors recently announced that current economic conditions have negatively impacted financial results 
in addition  recent developments associated with terrorist attacks on united states interests and a potential war with iraq have resulted in economic  political and other uncertainties  which could further adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
if demand for our software and related services decrease  our revenues would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected 
our inability to license software products to new customers may cause our stock price to fall 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could adversely affect the price of our stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied and are expected to continue to vary in the future 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet management s projections or analysts expectations  the price of our stock could decline 
many factors may cause these fluctuations  including demand for our software products and services  including the size and timing of individual contracts and our ability to recognize revenue with respect to contracts signed in the quarter  particularly with respect to our significant customers  changes in the length of our sales cycle  
table of contents competitive pricing pressures  customer order deferrals resulting from the anticipation of new products  economic uncertainty  disappointing operating results by the customer  or otherwise  the timing of new software product introductions and enhancements to our software products or those of our competitors  and market acceptance of our new software products  changes in our operating expenses  changes in the mix of domestic and international revenues  or expansion or contraction of international operations  our ability to complete fixed price consulting contracts within budget  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  operational issues resulting from corporate reorganizations see we may encounter difficulties successfully implementing our recent corporate reorganization  and lower than anticipated utilization in our consulting services group as a result of reduced levels of software sales  reduced implementation times for our products  changes in the mix of demand for our software products  or other reasons 
our stock price has been and may remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations 
examples of factors that we believe have caused fluctuations in our stock price in the recent past include the following cancelled or delayed purchasing decisions related to the september terrorist attack and the uncertainty related to potential future terrorist attacks or the threat of a us war with iraq  the millennium change  conversion to the euro currency  external and internal marketing issues  our announcement of our reduced visibility and increased uncertainty concerning future demand for our products  increased competition  elongated sales cycles  a limited number of reference accounts with implementations in the early years of product release  certain design and stability issues in early versions of our products  and lack of desired features and functionality 
in addition  fluctuations in the price of our common stock may expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could subject us to significant liabilities 
our gross margins may vary significantly or decline 
because the gross margins on product revenues software licenses and maintenance services are significantly greater than the gross margins on consulting services revenue  our combined gross margin has fluctuated from quarter to quarter  and it may continue to fluctuate significantly based on revenue mix 
subsequent to the september attack  we believe retailers have changed their buying behavior and that this has resulted in a fundamental shift in the mix of demand for the various types of products we sell 
demand for our portfolio merchandise management systems has declined and customers now appear to be more interested in buying strategic merchandise management solutions that require lower levels of services to implement  enable lower inventory levels without reducing sales  and provide a quicker return on investment 
the decline in software sales of portfolio merchandise management systems is having a corollary negative 
table of contents impact on our service revenues as consulting services revenue typically lags the performance of software revenues by as much as one year 
as a result of this change in revenue mix  we expect that our consulting services revenue will continue to decline sequentially each quarter until the demand for portfolio merchandise management systems and the related implementation services returns  or until underlying economic conditions improve 
in addition  our gross margins on consulting services revenue vary significantly with the rates at which we utilize our consulting personnel  and as a result  our overall gross margins will be adversely affected when there is not enough work to keep our consultants busy 
we may misjudge when software sales will be realized 
software license revenues in any quarter depend substantially upon contracts signed and the related shipment of software in that quarter 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately predict software license revenues 
because of the timing of our sales  we typically recognize the substantial majority of our software license revenues in the last weeks or days of the quarter  and we may derive a significant portion of our quarterly software license revenues from a small number of relatively large sales 
in addition  it is difficult to forecast the timing of large individual software license sales with a high degree of certainty due to the extended length of the sales cycle and the generally more complex contractual terms that may be associated with such licenses that could result in the deferral of some or all of the revenue to future periods 
accordingly  large individual sales have sometimes occurred in quarters subsequent to when we anticipated 
we expect these aspects of our business to continue 
if we receive any significant cancellation or deferral of customer orders  or we are unable to conclude license negotiations by the end of a fiscal quarter  our operating results may be lower than anticipated 
in addition  any weakening or uncertainty in the economy may make it more difficult for us to predict quarterly results in the future  and could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition for an indefinite period of time 
we may not be able to reduce expense levels if our revenues decline 
our expense levels are based on our expectations of future revenues 
since software license sales are typically accompanied by a significant amount of consulting and maintenance services  the size of our services organization must be managed to meet our anticipated software license revenues 
as a result  we hire and train service personnel and incur research and development costs in advance of anticipated software license revenues 
if software license revenues fall short of our expectations  or if we are unable to fully utilize our service personnel  our operating results are likely to decline because a significant portion of our expenses cannot be quickly reduced to respond to any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we may encounter difficulties successfully implementing our recent corporate reorganization 
in fourth quarter we substantially reorganized our company to improve the profitability of our operations and to implement our customer value program initiative 
as part of this reorganization  we terminated a significant number of personnel both domestically and internationally  reassigned certain existing personnel and added a number of new personnel 
we will likely encounter difficulties implementing this extensive and complex reorganization 
potential risks include  but are not limited to i the possibility that we may not be able to successfully persuade enough key e and arthur product development and support personnel to relocate to our corporate headquarters in scottsdale  arizona  ii the possible disruption in our operations caused by such a large and complex reorganization  iii the difficulty of accurately forecasting the timing  amount  and the nature of costs that we will incur in implementing the reorganization  particularly international termination costs  which can be significantly higher than domestic termination costs  and iv the possibility that we will not be able to successfully recruit appropriately skilled and experienced personnel to fill new positions 
we are dependent upon the retail industry 
historically  we have derived or more of our revenues from the license of software products and the performance of related services to retail customers 
although the acquisitions of arthur  intactix  zapotec  neovista decision series and e have expanded our product offerings to provide collaborative applications that address new vertical market opportunities with the manufacturers and wholesalers who supply our traditional retail customers  our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to retail customers 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  we believe that the licensing of certain of our software products involves a large capital 
table of contents expenditure  which is often accompanied by large scale hardware purchases or other capital commitments 
as a result  demand for our products and services could decline in the event of instability or potential downturns 
we believe the retail industry remains cautious with their level of investment in information technology during the current difficult economic cycle  perhaps due to poor macroeconomic conditions  and uncertainty related to the threat of future terrorist attacks and of a us war with iraq 
we remain concerned about weak and uncertain economic conditions  consolidations and the disappointing results of retailers in certain of our geographic regions 
the retail industry will be negatively impacted if negative economic conditions or fear of additional terrorists attacks or the threat of a us war with iraq persists for an extended period of time 
weak and uncertain economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  elongate our selling cycles  and delay  suspend or reduce the demand for our products 
as a result  it is difficult in the current economic environment to predict exactly when specific software licenses will close within a six to nine month time frame 
in addition  weak and uncertain economic conditions could impair our customers ability to pay for our products or services 
any of these factors could adversely impact our business  quarterly or annual operating results and financial condition 
we also believe that the retail industry may be consolidating  and that the industry is currently experiencing increased competition in certain geographical regions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation has in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies that occur in periods subsequent to the software license sale 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in many geographic regions around the world  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers that file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be less certain or harder to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled personnel 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate skilled personnel  including sales and marketing representatives  qualified software engineers involved in ongoing product development  and consulting personnel who assist in the implementation of our products and services 
the market for such individuals is competitive 
for example  it may be particularly difficult to attract and retain product development personnel experienced in the microsoft 
net platform since the 
net platform is a new and evolving technology 
given the critical roles of our sales  product development and consulting staffs  our inability to recruit successfully or any significant loss of key personnel would hurt us 
a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel characterize the software industry 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current personnel  attract and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  or be able to assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses 
we will continue to adjust the size and composition of the workforce in our services organization to match the different product and geographic demand cycles 
if we were unable to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel  or assimilate the employees from any acquired businesses  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 

table of contents we have only deployed certain of our software products on a limited basis  and have not yet deployed some software products that are important to our future growth 
certain of our software products  including mms multi channel  store portal  the unix oracle version of the portfolio replenishment module advanced warehouse replenishment by e  and certain modules of affinity and intellect  have been commercially released within the last two years 
other modules of affinity and intellect  as well as the unix oracle version of the portfolio replenishment module advanced store replenishment by e and the point of sale product that we purchased from j commerce  are still in beta or under development 
in addition  we have only recently announced our intentions to develop or acquire a series of business to business e commerce solutions  including products in furtherance of our pursuit of the market for collaborative solutions 
the markets for these products are new and evolving  and we believe that retailers and their suppliers may be cautious in adopting web based and other new technologies 
consequently  we cannot predict the growth rate  if any  and size of the markets for our e commerce products or that these markets will continue to develop 
potential and existing customers may find it difficult  or be unable  to successfully implement our e commerce products  or may not purchase our products for a variety of reasons  including their inability or unwillingness to deploy sufficient internal personnel and computing resources for a successful implementation 
in addition  we must overcome significant obstacles to successfully market our newer products  including limited experience of our sales and consulting personnel 
if the markets for our newer products fail to develop  develop more slowly or differently than expected or become saturated with competitors  or if our products are not accepted in the marketplace or are technically flawed  our business  operating results and financial condition will decline 
we are investing heavily in re writing many of our products for the microsoft 
net platform 
we currently plan to migrate pmm and store portal  as well as starting to re write the portfolio replenishment modules and portfolio planning using the microsoft 
net technology platform 
net platform during the first 
net platform products are not scheduled for commercial release until the end of we also plan to develop new products as well as shared code components using the 
net platform 
the risks of our commitment to the 
net platform include  but are not limited to  the following the possibility that prospective customers will refrain from purchasing the current versions of products to be re written because they are waiting for the 
net platform versions  the possibility that our 
net platform beta customers will not become favorable reference sites  iii adequate scalability of the 
net platform for our largest customers  adequate scalability of the 
net platform for our largest customers  the ability of our development staff to learn how to efficiently and effectively develop products using the 
net platform  our ability to transition our installed base onto the 
net platform when it is available  microsoft s ability to achieve market acceptance of the 
net platform  and microsoft s continued commitment to enhancing and marketing the 
net platform 
despite efforts to mitigate the risks of the 
net platform project  there can be no assurances that our efforts to re write many of our current products and to develop new products using the 
net platform will be successful 
if the 
net platform project is not successful  it likely will have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may introduce new lines of business where we are less experienced 
we may introduce new lines of business that are outside our traditional focus on software licenses and related maintenance and implementation services 
introducing new lines of business involves a number of uncertainties  including a lack of internal resources and expertise to operate and grow such new lines of business  immature internal processes and controls  inexperience predicting revenues and expenses for the new lines of business  and the possibility that such new lines of business will divert management attention and resources from our traditional business 
the inability of management to effectively develop and operate these new lines of business could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents business  operating results and financial condition 
moreover  we may not be able gain acceptance of any new lines of business in our markets  penetrate new markets successfully  or obtain the anticipated or desired benefits of such new lines of business 
there are many risks associated with international operations 
our international revenues represented of total revenues in the year ended december  as compared to and in and  respectively 
if our international operations grow  we must recruit and hire a number of new consulting  sales and marketing and support personnel in the countries in which we have or will establish offices 
our entry into new international markets typically requires the establishment of new marketing and distribution channels as well as the development and subsequent support of localized versions of our software 
international introductions of our products often require a significant investment in advance of anticipated future revenues 
the opening of our new offices typically results in initial recruiting and training expenses and reduced labor efficiencies associated with the introduction of products to a new market 
if we are less successful in a new market than we expect  we may not be able to realize an adequate return on our initial investment and our operating results could suffer 
we cannot guarantee that the countries in which we operate will have a sufficient pool of qualified personnel from which to hire  that we will be successful at hiring  training or retaining such personnel  or that we can expand or contract our international operations in a timely  cost effective manner 
our international business operations are subject to risks associated with international activities  including currency fluctuations  higher operating costs due to local laws or regulations  unexpected changes in employment and other regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  potentially negative tax consequences  difficulties in staffing and managing geographically disparate operations  greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  licensing and other trade restrictions  repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and general economic conditions in international markets 
consulting services in support of certain international software licenses typically have lower gross margins than those achieved domestically due to generally lower billing rates and or higher costs in certain of our international markets 
accordingly  any significant growth in our international operations may result in declines in gross margins on consulting services 
we expect that an increasing portion of our international software license  consulting services and maintenance services revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies  subjecting us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as we continue to expand our international operations  exposures to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions may increase 
we may choose to limit such exposure by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts or engaging in similar hedging strategies 
we cannot guarantee that any currency exchange strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
in addition  revenues earned in various countries where we do business may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which would reduce our earnings 
we may face difficulties in our highly competitive markets  particularly if the current weak economic conditions persist 
the markets for our software products are highly competitive 
however  we believe the number of significant competitors in many of our application markets has diminished over the past five years 
we believe the principal 
table of contents competitive factors in our markets are feature and functionality  product reputation and reference accounts  retail and supply chain industry expertise  total solution cost and quality of customer support 
we believe that pricing pressure has increased in response to the economic downturn  which could cause us to offer more significant discounts  or in some cases to lose potential business to competitors willing to offer what we believe to be overly aggressive discounts 
we encounter competitive products from a different set of vendors in each of our primary product categories 
our retail enterprise systems compete complete primarily with retek  inc  and with internally developed systems and other third party developers such as essentus  inc  gers  inc  marketmax  inc  micro strategies incorporated  evant  inc formerly nonstop solutions  nsb retail systems plc  sap ag  and svi holdings  inc in addition  new competitors may enter our markets and offer merchandise management systems that target the retail industry 
the competition for our in store systems is more fragmented than the competition for our retail enterprise systems 
we compete primarily with small point of sale focused companies such as crs business computers  datavantage  inc  commerce  tomax technologies and triversity  inc 
we also compete with other broad solution set providers such as nsb retail systems plc and retek  inc our current collaborative solutions compete primarily with products from marketmax  inc  evant inc 
formerly nonstop solutions  ac nielsen corporation  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  information resources  inc  and synchra systems 
in the market for consulting services  we have pursued a strategy of forming informal working relationships with leading retail systems integrators such as cap gemini ernst young  kurt salmon associates and ibm consulting services formerly pricewaterhousecoopers 
these integrators  as well as independent consulting firms such as accenture  ibm global services  aig netplex  cft consulting  lakewest consulting  spl and id applications  also represent competition to our consulting services group 
moreover  because many of these consulting firms are involved in advising our prospective customers in the software selection process  they may successfully encourage a prospective customer to select software from a software company with whom they have a relationship 
examples of such relationships between consulting firms and software companies include the relationships between retek  inc and accenture  and between retek  inc 
and ibm global services 
as we continue to develop or acquire e commerce products and expand our business in the collaborative solutions area  we expect to face potential competition from business to business e commerce application providers  including ariba  commerce one  commercialware  i technologies  manugistics group  inc  microsoft  inc  retek  inc  sap ag  synchra systems  ecometry corporation  and others 
a few of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  which could provide them with a significant competitive advantage over us 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors  or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
it may be difficult to identify  adopt and develop product architecture that is compatible with emerging industry standards 
the markets for our software products are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
if we fail in our product development efforts to accurately address evolving industry standards or important third party interfaces or product architectures  sales of our products and services will suffer 
our software products can be licensed with a variety of popular industry standard platforms  and are authored in various development environments using different programming languages and underlying databases and architectures 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace that may not be compatible with our software product design 
developing and maintaining consistent software product performance across various technology platforms could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents we may have difficulty implementing our products 
our software products are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the enterprise 
consequently  implementation of our software products can be a lengthy process  and commitment of resources by our clients is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control 
although average implementation times have recently declined  we believe the implementation of the unix oracle versions of our products can be longer and more complicated than our other applications as they typically i appeal to larger retailers who have multiple divisions requiring multiple implementation projects  ii require the execution of implementation procedures in multiple layers of software  iii offer a retailer more deployment options and other configuration choices  and iv may involve third party integrators to change business processes concurrent with the implementation of the software 
delays in the implementations of any of our software products  whether by our business partners or us  may result in client dissatisfaction  disputes with our customers  or damage to our reputation 
significant problems implementing our software therefore  can cause delays or prevent us from collecting license fees for our software and can damage our ability to get new business 
our fixed price service contracts may result in losses 
we offer a combination of software products  consulting and maintenance services to our customers 
typically  we enter into service agreements with our customers that provide for consulting services on a time and expenses basis 
certain clients have asked for  and we have from time to time entered into  fixed price service contracts  which link services payments  and occasionally software payments  to implementation milestones 
we believe fixed price service contracts may increasingly be offered by our competitors to differentiate their product and service offerings 
as a result  we may need to enter into more fixed price contracts in the future 
if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations under fixed price contracts within our estimated cost structure  our operating results could suffer 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspect of our technology 
the reverse engineering  unauthorized copying  or other misappropriation of our technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying for it 
we rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we seek to protect the source code to our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
to date  we have not protected our technology with patents 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
we license our software products under signed license agreements that impose restrictions on the licensee s ability to utilize the software and do not permit the re sale  sublicense or other transfer of the source code 
finally  we seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and independent consultants to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code 
there has been a substantial amount of litigation in the software and internet industries regarding intellectual property rights 
it is possible that in the future third parties may claim that our current or potential future software solutions or we infringe on their intellectual property 
we expect that software product developers and providers of e commerce products will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap 
moreover  as software patents become more common  the likelihood increases that a patent holder will bring an infringement action against us  or against our customers  to whom we have indemnification obligations 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
since we now resell hardware we may also become subject to claims from third parties that the hardware  or the combination of hardware and software  infringe their intellectual property 
although we may disclaim certain intellectual property representations to our customers  these disclaimers may not be sufficient to fully protect us against such claims 
we may be more vulnerable to patent claims since we do not have any patents that we can assert defensively against a patent infringement claim 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may 
table of contents not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we lose access to critical third party software or technology  our costs could increase and the introduction of new products and product enhancements could be delayed  potentially hurting our competitive position 
we license and integrate technology from third parties in certain of our software products 
for example  we license the uniface client server application development technology from compuware  inc for use in pmm  certain applications from silvon software  inc for use in ideas  ibm s net 
commerce merchant server software for use in mms multi channel  and the syncsort application for use in portfolio planning 
these third party licenses generally require us to pay royalties and fulfill confidentiality obligations 
if we are unable to continue to license any of this third party software  or if the third party licensors do not adequately maintain or update their products  we would face delays in the releases of our software until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed or developed  and integrated into our software products 
these delays  if they occur  could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is also possible that intellectual property acquired from third parties through acquisitions  mergers  licenses or otherwise may not have been adequately protected 
we may face liability if our products are defective or if we make errors implementing our products 
our software products are highly complex and sophisticated 
as a result  they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our products may involve customer specific configuration by third parties or us  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
in particular  it is common for complex software programs  such as our unix oracle and e commerce software products  to contain undetected errors when first released 
they are discovered only after the product has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of applications and environments 
despite extensive testing  we have in the past discovered certain defects or errors in our products or custom configurations only after our software products have been used by many clients 
in addition  our clients may occasionally experience difficulties integrating our products with other hardware or software in their environment that are unrelated to defects in our products 
such defects  errors or difficulties may cause future delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or impair customer satisfaction with our products 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive  and that speed to market is critical to our success 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to enhance our existing products through internal development and strategic partnering  internally develop new products which leverage both our existing customers and sales force  and strategically acquire complementary retail point and collaborative solutions that add functionality for specific business processes to an enterprise wide system 
if clients experience significant problems with implementation of our products or are otherwise dissatisfied with their functionality or performance or if they fail to achieve market acceptance for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance depends in large part on the continued performance of our executive officers and other key employees  particularly the performance and services of james d 
armstrong our chief executive officer and hamish n 
brewer our president 
we do not have in place key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of mr 
armstrong  mr 
brewer  or other key executive officers or employees without a successor in place could negatively affect our financial performance 
we may have difficulty integrating acquisitions 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  products and technologies  including those that are significant in size and scope 
in pursuit of our strategy to acquire complementary products  we completed the acquisition of the assets of zapotec software  inc in february  and the neovista decision series from accrue software  inc in june  and the acquisition of all the common stock of e in september the e acquisition 
table of contents was our largest to date  and involves the integration of e s products and operations in countries 
in addition we acquired certain intellectual property from j commerce on april  the risks we commonly encounter in acquisitions include we may have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  we may have difficulty effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  our ongoing business may be disrupted by transition and integration issues  we may not be able to retain key technical and managerial personnel from the acquired business  we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  we may have difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  our relationships with partner companies or third party providers of technology or products could be adversely affected  our relationships with employees and customers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  legal contingencies  and product development  among other things  and we may be required to sustain significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful 
it may become increasingly expensive to obtain and maintain liability insurance at current levels 
we contract for insurance to cover a variety of potential risks and liabilities 
in the current market  insurance coverage is becoming more restrictive and expensive  and when certain insurance coverage is offered  the deductible for which we are responsible is larger 
in light of these circumstances  it may become more difficult to maintain insurance coverage at historical levels  or if such coverage is available  the cost to obtain or maintain it may increase substantially 
this may result in our being forced to bear the burden of an increased portion of risks for which we have traditionally been covered by insurance  which could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate changes that could impact translations of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and future earnings and cash flows from transactions denominated in different currencies 
international revenues represented of our total revenues in  as compared with in in addition  the identifiable net assets of our foreign operations totaled of consolidated assets at december  as compared to at december  our exposure to currency exchange rate changes is diversified due to the number of different countries in which we conduct business 
we operate outside the united states primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  asia pacific  canada and latin america 
we have determined that the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency and as such  foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
changes in the currency exchange rates of our foreign subsidiaries resulted in our reporting unrealized foreign currency exchange gain of million in compared to a loss of million in we currently have no derivative instruments and did not engage in any material foreign currency hedging transactions in or foreign currency gains and losses will continue to result from fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct operations as compared to the us dollar  and future operating results will be affected to some extent by gains and losses from foreign currency exposure 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our exposures from foreign net assets as of december   to assess the 
table of contents impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency rates 
based upon the results of these analyses  a adverse change in all foreign currency rates from the december  rates would result in a currency translation loss of million before tax 
interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and variable and fixed rate obligations of the us government and its agencies  states  municipalities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
interest income earned on our investments is reflected in our financial statements under the caption other income  net 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have suffered a decline in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we hold our investment securities for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of securities held at december  was million  which is approximately the same as amortized cost  with interest rates generally ranging between and
