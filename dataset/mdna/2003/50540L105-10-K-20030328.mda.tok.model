the combined effect of the above factors resulted in a net loss of million  or per share as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in trends the following is management s analysis of certain existing trends that have been identified as potentially affecting the future financial results of the company 
due to the potential for a rapid rate of change in any number of factors associated with the risk assessment and clinical industries  it is difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty labone s future volumes  sales  margins or net earnings 
the risk assessment services market continues to be highly competitive 
the primary focus of the competition has been on lower pricing for laboratory and paramedical services  and the ability to deliver integrated services such as total account management and electronic connectivity 
labone is focusing on its commitment to customer service  provision of quality products and services at competitive prices and continuous development of innovative data management services and technological solutions that differentiate us from competitors 
during  labone continued to contract with national life insurance carriers to provide teleunderwriting services 
under the terms of these contracts  labone personnel conduct telephone interviews relating to the medical histories of new life insurance policy applicants 
the company anticipates that there will be continued increases in these services during revenue from the examone division increased million in the paramedical industry historically returns a lower gross margin than labone s other market segments 
in most cases  a substantial percentage of the revenue from a specimen collection is paid to a contractor who owns and operates an independent local office that arranges for the collection 
if the revenue from examone continues to grow as a percentage of total labone revenue  its lower gross margins will add to the total profitability of labone but will reduce the average gross profit percentage of revenue 
although future volumes of laboratory specimens for risk assessment testing are expected to be lower than in when the company realized a substantial increase believed to be related to  the company continues to offer additional tests  such as screening for hepatitis c  prostrate specific antigen and c reactive protein  as a cost effective underwriting tool 
the company has realized some acceptance of these additional tests by its clients 
in clinical healthcare  the company continued its trend of growth through the lab card program  marketing to physician practices and new managed care agreements 
membership with the lab card program is approximately million members 
the program continued to expand through new members as well as increased utilization from existing members 
the company serves approximately  managed care members under exclusive managed care outpatient laboratory service arrangements 
the company continues to add network approvals for healthcare plans in focused regional physician markets to increase penetration 
managed care organizations  and the physicians who are under their contracts  continue to choose labone for its quality controlled testing  disease management data capabilities  and responsive customer service and support 
development of new clinical tests and proprietary methodologies for use by healthcare providers continues to expand 
recent discoveries or potential technology breakthroughs could enable rapid acceleration of this development and subsequent demand for these tests 
these tests are often characterized by higher processing costs or limited access through specific laboratories 
labone s response to this trend has been to internalize methodologies for these tests  thus lowering costs  and to seek adequate reimbursement for these tests from payors and clients 
the ability of outside firms to advance new tests and create demand for them  offset by the company s ability to successfully limit the expense impact of such tests and to be adequately reimbursed  may pressure clinical healthcare gross margins in the future 
alternatively  labone s responsive strategy may create advantages over smaller  less equipped competition 
the clinical sat market is sensitive to economic conditions and levels of new employment 
due to the recent economic downturn  the company has not experienced any appreciable revenue growth in this market 
liquidity and capital resources labone s working capital position increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase is due to cash provided by operations and net financing activities exceeding capital additions and acquisitions 
net cash provided by operations increased to million in from million in primarily due to improved operating results 
accounts receivable grew to million as of december   from million as of december   due to the increase in revenue 
total cash and investments at december   were million  as compared to million at december  management expects to be able to fund operations from a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings 
during  the company spent million for capital investments and million for capital expenditures 
capital investments for included the acquisition of central plains laboratories in hays  kansas  for million in cash and an additional million for several paramedical affiliates 
during  the company spent million for capital investments and million for capital expenditures 
the amount spent in included million for the purchase of osborn and million on the acquisition of various paramedical operations 
capital expenditures in included million for software development and information systems 
to finance the purchase of the osborn group in  labone issued million of convertible preferred stock   warrants to purchase labone stock at per share and million of subordinated debt to wcas in exchange for million cash 
the preferred stock is convertible into labone common stock at a rate of per share and earns a paid in kind dividend at a fixed rate of compounded semiannually 
the convertible preferred stock may be converted at the company s election after august   if the common stock is trading at or above per share for out of consecutive trading days 
final redemption of the convertible preferred stock on august   may be paid in cash or stock at the company s election 
the million of subordinated debt bore a fixed interest rate of and was refinanced on december  interest on the industrial revenue bonds issued to finance the construction of the company s lenexa facility is based on a taxable seven day variable rate which  including letter of credit and remarketing fees  is approximately as of february  the bonds mature over the next seven years in increments of million per year plus interest 
the fourth principal payment of million was paid in september the company converted to a new line of credit during with a total availability of million 
the line was co arranged by jp morgan securities  inc and wachovia securities  inc 
the company currently has million outstanding on this line

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
for the company  this statement is effective january  the company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities effective january  
sfas no 
replaces current accounting literature and requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others 
the interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december   and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created or obtained after january  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the use of estimates and assumptions and accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition while many operational aspects are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for labone s business is generally straightforward 
the company recognizes revenues for its services when those services are provided to the client 
revenues related to clinical healthcare billings include adjustments for revenue disallowances estimated at the time the revenue is booked 
reserve for doubtful accounts the estimate of reserves for doubtful accounts involves a standardized monthly approach to review the collectibility of receivables based on contractual agreements and the aging of accounts receivable 
contractual agreements  historical collection patterns and payor reimbursement experience are integral in the estimation of reserves for doubtful accounts 
in addition  the current state of billing functions is assessed in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues in order to assess the impact  if any  on reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
adjustments to the reserve for contractual agreements are reported as a reduction in revenues 
other adjustments to the reserve are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative expenses 
the collection and reserves processes  along with the monitoring of billing processes  helps to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection and reimbursement experience and billing functions 
based on the amounts reserved for uncollectible accounts in  a increase or decrease in current year reserve for uncollectible accounts would have had an impact of approximately million 
software developed for internal use certain internal and external costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use are capitalized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
these capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to amortization  over the estimated useful life of the software  beginning when the software project is complete 
the company periodically reviews the lives and values of its capitalized software and makes adjustments if necessary 
goodwill and intangible assets the company allocates the purchase price of acquired businesses in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
a portion of the purchase price is assigned to each individual asset acquired on the basis of its fair value 
intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights 
if intangible assets do not arise from contractual or other legal rights  they are recognized as assets apart from goodwill only if they are capable of being separated from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill have a determinable life and are amortized accordingly 
the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to the tangible assets and any separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the company evaluates the recoverability and measures the potential impairment of goodwill under sfas management of and internal reporting for the company s principal business segments are differentiated as these segments perform distinct business activities 
management believes these business segments represent appropriate reporting units for the evaluation of impairment 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units to determine if any impairment exists 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of the company  as well as the financial projections and future prospects of business  including growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and comparable sales prices  if available 
to assess potential impairment  the estimate of fair value for the company is compared to the book value of the consolidated net assets 
if the book value of the consolidated net assets is greater than the estimate of fair value  the company then proceeds to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of th e assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
the company believes its estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an interest rate risk exposure exists due to labone s variable interest rates associated with its liability of million borrowing on its line of credit and million in industrial revenue bonds 
the interest expense on the line of credit is based on the libor rate plus a range of to basis points and is approximately at february  the interest expense incurred on the bonds is based on a taxable seven day variable rate which  including letter of credit and remarketing fees  is approximately as of february  any future increase in interest rates would result in additional interest expense which could be material 
an assumed increase in interest rates representing approximately basis points would potentially increase interest expense on these instruments by million annually 
a foreign currency risk exposure exists due to billing canadian subsidiary revenue in canadian dollars and the direct laboratory expenses associated with this revenue being incurred in us dollars 
this exposure is not considered to be material
