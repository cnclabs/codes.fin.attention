item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in this item and elsewhere in this report contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described under important factors that may affect future operations and results below 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company principally focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of antibody  protein and peptide based therapeutic products 
we have two product candidates in clinical trials  dx and dx  and have collaborative agreements for the development of both of these product candidates 
we are currently conducting two phase ii trials of dx for the treatment of patients with hereditary angioedema hae one is being conducted in europe  in which treatment was completed in march  and the other is being conducted in the united states with the intent to add international sites 
we are also conducting a phase i ii study of dx in the united states in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass 
our collaborator for dx has completed a phase iia trial in adult patients with cystic fibrosis and has initiated a second phase iia trial in children with cystic fibrosis 
we use our proprietary  patented technology  known as phage display  to identify a broad range of compounds with the potential for the treatment of various diseases 
we are using phage display technology to build a broad portfolio of product candidates that we plan to develop and commercialize either ourselves or with others 
on behalf of collaborators  we also use phage display technology to identify compounds that can be used in therapeutics  diagnostic imaging  the development of research reagents  and in purifying and manufacturing biopharmaceuticals 
we are further leveraging our phage display technology through collaborations and licenses that are structured to generate revenues through research funding  license fees  technical and clinical milestone payments  and royalties 
we also develop  manufacture and sell chromatography separations systems and products through our biotage subsidiary 
we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of chromatography separations systems that use disposable cartridges to separate and purify pharmaceuticals being produced for research and clinical development 
recent development on march   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a registered directed offering covered by our shelf registration on form s file no 
 which had been declared effective on may  results of operations year ended december  and total revenues for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
separations product revenues represents revenues generated by our wholly owned biotage subsidiary from the sale of chromatography separations systems and consumables 
biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues represents revenues generated by our biopharmaceutical business 
separations product revenues and biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues accounted for and of total revenues in both and separations product revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in separations product revenues was due to increased unit sales in biotage s drug discovery purification systems and consumable business 
biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues was primarily due to the related revenues from increased clinical manufacturing activity in our dx product development program as well as the continued expansion of our phage display research collaborations 
cost of products sold related to separations product revenues in was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of separations product revenues was and for and  resulting in a gross margin from separations product revenues of and for and  respectively 
these improvements in gross margin reflect increased separations product sales in  increased direct sales through biotage s foreign subsidiaries instead of sales through independent distributors  as well as continued efforts to reduce and control material costs 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  clinical trial and related costs  contract manufacturing and other outside costs  and overhead costs 
research and development expenses for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from increased compound manufacturing and related external research and development expenditures for clinical trials 
these increases were partially offset by a staff reduction that occurred in september of when we reduced the scope of our early discovery research programs in the area of small protein and peptide discovery to focus early stage discovery efforts on monoclonal antibodies 
in conjunction with this refocusing  we reduced our total workforce by people which represented of our biopharmaceutical workforce from our cambridge  massachusetts and liege  belgium facilities 
the cost to us of the associated severance was approximately  including  of severance for workforce reductions related to research and development  which was incurred during the third quarter of we expect the full effect of these cost reductions to be realized in as of december   we had ongoing costs due to the initiation of a phase i ii clinical trial of dx for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass cpb  costs associated with enrollment into the united states of edema  a phase ii patient clinical study of dx for the treatment of hereditary angioedema hae  enrollment into a phase ii clinical study of hae in europe  and manufacturing costs associated with the ongoing phase ii trial in europe for dx in cystic fibrosis cf 
we expect to complete and report preliminary results from all four of these active trials during  but the length of time needed to complete clinical trials can vary substantially 
an estimation of clinical trial completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly and are difficult to predict 
we expect that we will incur the most significant clinical development costs of these product candidates during phase iii trials 
in conducting both biopharmaceutical and separation product development  research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
expenses for selling  general and administrative included salaries  fringe and other expenses for business development and corporate administrative functions  as well as expenses related to protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  meeting the reporting requirements of a public company  and selling and marketing expenses at biotage as we continue to expand our sales capabilities 
in light of current business conditions  we contained spending in this area during and continue to review our organization and cost structure to further manage operating expenses and improve efficiencies 
net other expense income decreased to an expense of  in from million of income in  a decrease of million 
the decrease resulted primarily from higher interest expense associated with long term obligations  lower interest income earned from a lower average invested cash balance  and lower yield rates 
net loss in was million  compared to million in year ended december  and total revenues for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
separations product revenues and biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues accounted for and respectively  of total revenues in  as compared with and in separations product revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in separations product revenues was due to increased unit sales in biotage s drug discovery purification systems and consumable business 
biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues was primarily due to a full year of amortization associated with the upfront payments on several large funded collaborative arrangements  which were entered into during  as well as the continued expansion of our phage display licensing program  including the recognition of a perpetual patent license in as a result of amortization of upfront fees for collaborations signed in  our deferred revenues decreased to million from million as of december  and  respectively 
these biopharmaceutical product development and license fees are amortized over the expected term of each agreement  ranging from one to six years 
cost of products sold in was million  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the cost of products sold as a percentage of separations product revenues remained constant at  resulting in a gross margin from separations product revenues of 
research and development expenses for were million  compared with million in  an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from increased compound manufacturing and related expenditures for clinical trials  salaries and fringe expenses  and expenditures on new collaborative arrangements 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in non cash compensation because deferred compensation in included the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is primarily due to increased salaries and fringe expenses in business development and corporate administrative functions  professional fees related to expanding and protecting our intellectual property and meeting the reporting requirements of a public company  and selling and marketing expenses at biotage as we continue to expand our sales capabilities including opening a japanese sales subsidiary 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in non cash compensation because deferred compensation in included the acceleration of vesting of certain restricted stock related to the completion of our initial public offering 
net other income increased to million in from million in  due to an increase in interest income earned from a higher average invested cash balance 
net loss in was million compared to million in liquidity and capital resources through december   we have funded our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  including net proceeds of million from our august initial public offering 
we have also generated funds from separations product revenues  biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues  interest income and other sources 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  a decrease of million from december  our excess funds are currently invested in us treasury obligations and certificates of deposit 
on march   we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a registered directed offering for net proceeds of million 
our operating activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the use of cash in both years resulted primarily from our losses from operations and changes in our working capital accounts  net of depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense 
during  cash used for operating activities increased approximately million from december  this was primarily due to increased research and development costs including clinical trial costs 
as of december  we had four active clinical trials compared to only two active clinical trials at december  our investing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our investing activities consisted principally of fixed assets purchases and payments on licensed patent technology 
we estimate that we will reduce our investment level in for equipment to satisfy our facilities requirements for our research activities as compared to our investment level during we have historically financed fixed asset purchases through capital lease arrangements 
at december   we had an open facility with a lender  but the lender has no obligation to fund any further amounts 
the capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets sold to the lender 
we believe that we will be able to obtain funding for our future fixed asset purchases through our existing or alternative lenders 
if we cannot obtain additional funding we will have to use our existing cash and cash equivalents to fund future fixed asset purchases 
the leasehold improvement obligations are currently collateralized by a stand by letter of credit for the amount financed 
if at the end of any quarter  our unrestricted cash is less than the greater of million or annualized cash needs  we must provide to the lender an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount equal to the amount of leasehold improvements financed  which was million at december  we anticipate we will be required to provide this letter of credit during the first half of based on our annualized cash needs 
annualized cash needs are determined by multiplying the cash used in operations on a consolidated basis for the most recently ended quarter by four 
in connection with the construction of biotage s new facility in charlottesville  virginia  biotage executed a loan agreement for approximately million from a commercial bank 
the loan was converted to a term loan during the first quarter and will be repaid over years with interest at a rate fixed for five year periods based on the five year us treasury note rate in effect plus 
interest is fixed at for the first five years and will be adjusted once every five years thereafter  but may be adjusted earlier if biotage fails to maintain an average non interest bearing compensating balance of  at the lending bank  which is included in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the loan  which is included in long term obligations on our balance sheet 
biotage drew down the remaining  during the first quarter of our financing activities provided million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from long term obligations  proceeds from our cambridge landlord for leasehold improvements  the exercise of stock options and the exercise from our employee stock purchase plan  offset by increases in restricted cash and the repayments of long term obligations 
on may   genzyme corporation and we amended and restated our collaboration agreement for the development of dx genzyme and we also executed a senior secured promissory note and security agreement under which genzyme agreed to loan us up to million and we pledged certain tangible and intangible personal property of or arising out of the dx program 
the security agreement provides for additional collateral should we  under the amended collaboration agreement  exercise our option to purchase genzyme s interest in the application of dx in cardiopulmonary bypass and other surgery for million  or should we fail to meet certain financial covenants 
the financial covenants state that we must maintain at least million in cash or cash equivalents based on our quarterly consolidated financial statements and that we maintain at least one continued listing standard for the nasdaq national market 
we intend to exercise our option to purchase genzyme s interest in the cardiopulmonary bypass and other surgery indication in the first quarter of  which will require us to pay million to genzyme in the second quarter of when we exercise the option  the security agreement provides that genzyme release its security interest in the portion of the dx program relating to the cardiopulmonary bypass and other surgery indication and that we pledge a percentage of our interest in our biotage subsidiary as additional collateral for the loan 
outlook in  we anticipate total revenues will increase by approximately to 
separations product revenues should continue to grow due to our continued strength in the chromatography separations systems market  particularly our cartridge chromatography and horizon instrumentation product lines 
we also expect biopharmaceutical product development and license revenues to grow based on our expectations regarding additional collaboration opportunities available to us in the therapeutic antibody area  the continued progress in clinical development  and expanded arrangements relating to our dx and dx product candidates 
statements about our expectations of the period of time through which financial resources will be adequate to support our operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents plus anticipated cash flow from product revenues and collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plans into we expect to use approximately to million in cash during if our existing resources and cash flows from product sales and collaborations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity  debt securities or otherwise further leverage assets 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
contractual obligations we have long term obligations 
minimum future payments under our long term obligations as of december  are as follows and thereafter  total future minimum payments  less amount representing interest  present value of future minimum payments  less current portion  long term obligations  we have non cancelable operating leases in the united states and europe 
minimum future lease payments under these leases as of december  are as follows and thereafter  critical accounting estimates the united states securities and exchange commission sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting estimates 
the sec defines critical accounting estimates as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our accounting policies are described in note in the consolidated financial statements 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting estimates 
however  the following estimates could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
if it is determined that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation 
if market value is less than cost  then we write down the related inventory to market value 
if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market value cannot be greater than the net realizable value 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
our estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the valuation of the excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
at december  and  our inventory balance was million and million  respectively 
during  and  inventory valuation write downs were  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance net of allowances for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  and  provisions for doubtful accounts were   and  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant industry or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
our intangible assets at the end of consisted primarily of a license for antibody technology from a third party 
the balance net of accumulated amortization of our other intangible assets was million and  at december  and  respectively 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
revenue recognition separations product revenue is generally recognized on product sales arrangements based on product shipment if no installation obligations exist 
for separations product sale arrangements that require installation services that are not considered essential to the functionality of the product  revenue is recognized upon shipment and a portion of revenue equal to the fair value of the installation service is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation 
for separations product sale arrangements that require significant installation services and contain customer acceptance criteria  all revenue is recognized upon the completion of the installation and satisfaction of the customer acceptance criteria 
we enter into biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborators for the research and development of therapeutic  diagnostic and other products 
the terms of the agreements may include non refundable signing fees  funding for research and development  licensing fees  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from the collaborations 
non refundable signing fees are recognized as services are performed over the expected term of the collaboration 
funding for research and development  where the amounts recorded are non refundable  is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
we evaluate all collaborative agreements on a quarterly basis to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for that period 
the evaluation includes all of the potential revenue components from each specific collaborative agreement 
upon achievement of milestones  a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the collaboration completed through that date is recognized 
the remainder is recognized as services are performed over the remaining term of the collaboration 
royalties are recognized when earned 
we license our patent rights covering phage display on a non exclusive basis in the fields of therapeutics  antibody based in vitro diagnostics  research products and others 
standard terms of the license agreements  for which we have no future obligations  generally include non refundable signing fees  non refundable annual license maintenance fees  development milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
signing fees and annual maintenance fees are recognized in equal monthly installments over the period to which the payment applies 
perpetual patent licenses are recognized immediately if we have no future obligations 
milestone payments under non exclusive phage display patent licenses are recognized when the milestone is achieved and royalties are recognized when they are earned 
revenue from national institute of standards and technology and other grants to conduct research and development is recognized as eligible costs are incurred  up to the funding limit 
eligible grant related costs  which have been incurred in advance of cash receipts are recorded as receivables 
payments received that have not met the appropriate criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
at december  and  our deferred revenue related to product development agreements was million and million  respectively 
significant assumptions and estimates include the expected term of the agreement and total expected cost 
our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in our estimates could have a material impact on revenues and our results of operations 
litigation claims as of december   we were engaged in a united states court proceeding relating to three patents owned by a third party  however  on february   the court granted summary judgment of noninfringement in our favor with respect to the three asserted patents 
on march   the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the united states district court of appeals to federal circuit 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
we record at least the minimum estimated liability related to claims where there is a range of loss and the loss is considered probable 
because of the uncertainties related to the likelihood and amount of loss on any of our pending claims  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending claims and revise our estimates 
future revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the exposure for any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we make every effort to use the best information available to us in determining the level of liability reserves 
as of december   we have no reserves for litigation settlements 
related party transactions our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board also serves as an outside director of genzyme corporation and was a consultant to genzyme until in  we entered into a sublease agreement with genzyme for laboratory and office facilities in cambridge  massachusetts  which was extended to and terminated in april rent expense in connection with this sublease of   and  was recorded in each year ended december   and  respectively 
during  we signed two patent license agreements with genzyme under the our standard license terms 
we recorded license revenues of  for each year ended december   and  in connection with the maintenance fees on these two agreements 
as of december  and  the related accounts receivable balance was and  respectively 
in october  we entered into a collaboration and commercialization agreement with genzyme for one of our proprietary therapeutic compounds for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases  with initial development to be focused on the treatment of hereditary angioedema 
on may   genzyme and we amended our collaboration agreement 
we are now funding the development of dx for the treatment of hae and expect to complete the first phase ii clinical trial for hae the initial program early in the second quarter of genzyme has an option to acquire a interest in the dx program upon our completion of the initial program  and will have a period of days after review of the clinical trial data to exercise its option 
if genzyme exercises its option  it will be responsible for of the development costs incurred subsequent to completion of the initial program 
upon dosing the first patient in a pivotal clinical trial of dx for hae  genzyme will be obligated to pay us one half of the development costs in excess of million that we incurred through completion of the initial program 
through december   we had incurred approximately million of development cost in the program 
on may   we and genzyme also executed a senior secured promissory note and security agreement under which genzyme agreed to loan us up to million and we pledged certain tangible and intangible personal property of or arising out of the dx program 
as of december   we had borrowed the full amount available under the loan 
in addition  as of december   genzyme owns approximately of our common stock outstanding 
in june  we provided a loan to an officer of the company in the amount of  the note  which bears interest at the prime rate at december  plus is payable in june  subject to acceleration  and becomes due immediately if the officer s employment is terminated other than by us without cause 
as long as the officer remains employed by us  we will forgive  and all accrued interest on june annually 
in the event of the officer s death or permanent disability  the remaining principal of the loan plus all accrued interest will be forgiven 
for the years ended december   and interest due was forgiven in the amount of   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and principal was forgiven in the amount of  at december  and  the balance outstanding on this note was  and  respectively 
the outstanding principal of this loan at december  was repaid during march  after the officer resigned 
in october  we provided a mortgage loan and pledge agreement in the amount of  to our president and chief executive officer  who is also chairman of the our board of directors  to purchase a residence within commuting distance of our headquarters 
the loan bears interest at the prime rate at december  less  or the applicable federal rate at december   which ever is higher and is collateralized by the real estate acquired with the loan proceeds and shares of our common stock owned by this officer 
the agreement as amended in  requires that aggregate collateral value of at least of the outstanding loan principal be maintained throughout the life of the loan 
payments in the amount of  are due monthly to us which are applied to interest and then principal 
all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest is payable on october   provided  however that it may be accelerated at any time at the discretion of the board of directors  including upon i termination of his service as chairman and chief executive officer  provided  however that in the case of death or disability  payment shall not be due for at least twelve months after termination  or ii at any time that our cash and marketable investments total less than  due to the maturity date of the note all amounts outstanding at december  are included in the current portion of notes receivable  employees 
the balance outstanding on this note was  and  at december  and  respectively 
tax loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be available to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates from through we have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of deductions from the exercise of stock options 
this deferred asset has been fully reserved until it is more likely than not that the benefit from the exercise of stock options will be realized 
the benefit from this million deferred tax asset will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized 
as required by sfas no 
 our management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets  which are comprised principally of nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards 
management has determined at this time that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and  as a result  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established at december  recent pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
the disclosure requirements are required in all financial statements initially issued after january  for vie s created prior to february   the interpretation will be effective after the first interim reporting period after june  for vie s created after january   the interpretation will be effective immediately 
we do not expect the application of this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  with respect to the alternative transition methods permitted and the annual disclosures required 
the disclosure provisions for interim financial information is effective for all periods presented in financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have not yet evaluated the alternative transition methods if it were to adopt sfas under this new standard  however  we have complied with all current disclosure requirements 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf provides guidance on determining whether a revenue arrangement contains multiple deliverable items and if so  requires revenue to be allocated amongst the multiple elements based on fair values 
eitf also provides guidance as to when recognition of revenue for each deliverable is appropriate 
the effective date of this issue is required for revenue arrangements entered into by us after june  we do not expect the application of this issue to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee 
the interpretation also requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued  including warranties 
the accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for all guarantees outstanding  regardless of when they were issued or modified  during the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the fair value provisions of this statement are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the application of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
important factors that may affect future operations and results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements appear principally in the sections entitled business and management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
forward looking statements may appear in other sections of this report as well 
generally  the forward looking statements in this report use words like expect  believe  continue  anticipate  estimate  may  will  could  opportunity  future  project  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements include statements about our results of operations  research and development programs  clinical trials  and collaborations 
statements that are not historical facts are based on our current expectations  beliefs  assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections for our business and the industry and markets in which we compete 
the forward looking statements contained in this report are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in such forward looking statements 
we caution investors not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained in this report 
these statements speak only as of the date of this report  and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise them  except as required by law 
the following factors  among others  create risks and uncertainties that could affect our future or other performance our history of operating losses and our expectation that we will incur significant additional operating losses  any inability to raise the capital that we will need to sustain our operations  any inability to successfully and expeditiously complete the rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approvals processes that any biopharmaceutical or diagnostic product candidates that we develop must undergo  which could substantially delay or prevent their development or marketing  our dependence on third parties to manufacture biopharmaceuticals  which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize any biopharmaceuticals we may develop  our lack of experience in conducting clinical trials  regulatory processes  and conducting sales and marketing activities  any or all of which may adversely impact our ability to commercialize any biopharmaceuticals we may develop  our dependence on the expertise  effort  priorities and contractual obligations of our collaborators  any changes in our collaborators business direction or priorities or defaults in their obligations may have an adverse impact on our research revenues and ultimately our license revenues and expenses  any failure by us or our collaborators to gain market acceptance of our biopharmaceuticals  competition and technological change that may make our potential products and technologies less attractive or obsolete  any inability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and technologies  time consuming and expensive proceedings to obtain  enforce or defend patents and to defend against charges of infringement that may result in unfavorable outcomes and could limit our patent rights and our activities  significant fluctuations in our revenues and operating results  which have occurred in the past and which we expect to continue to fluctuate in the future  any loss or inability to hire and retain qualified personnel  difficulties in managing our growth  our dependence on one supplier for a key component in our separations products  our handling  storage or disposal of hazardous materials used and generated in our business may be time consuming and expensive  our exposure to product liability  risks associated with international sales and operations and collaborations  failure to acquire technology and integrate complementary businesses  our common stock may continue to have a volatile public trading price and low trading volume  and anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law and our shareholder rights plan that may make an acquisition of us more difficult 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results  which could materially affect our business  financial position  and stock price 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit important factors that may affect future operations and results to this form k  which is incorporated into this item by this reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily us treasury funds and certificates of deposit  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
our short term investments will decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase  and therefore  our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
as of december   we had million outstanding under long term obligations
