table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgements and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods presented 
listed below are our most significant accounting policies and estimates  which we think are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
please keep the following policies and estimates in mind when reading the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
accounts receivable we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer information 
we maintain credit insurance on major customer balances and have a relatively diversified customer base 
in the current year  our losses due to credit issues were very small 
however  there is no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same low rates in the future 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of a large customer or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to collect our receivables and we may incur losses as a result 
inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out basis or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we use a standard cost system to estimate the actual costs of inventory and regularly review actual costs and the estimated market value of inventory to standard costs 
significant changes to our purchasing or manufacturing costs either an increase or a decrease could cause material changes to the valuation of our inventory when we adjust standard costs to reflect the change 
we estimate the market value of inventory based upon existing and forecasted demand for end products for the next twelve months and estimated amounts of inventory that would be consumed 
we reduce the valuation of inventory items that are in excess supply compared to demand  items that have had limited usage over time  items that may no longer be usable due to product obsolescence and items that we decide to discontinue selling 
we have a product rationalization process that involves key management personnel to identify and evaluate products and related inventory that fall into those situations 
in recent years we have written off significant amounts of inventory 
in the current year we wrote down million of inventory to reflect changes that occurred in our marketing strategy to accelerate the migration of our products to smaller packages 
this was done in response to an abrupt shift in market requirements toward smaller packages 
if the facts and circumstances require it  we may have to write down inventory again in future periods 
our electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could make such write downs necessary 
also  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the valuation adjustments for obsolete and slow moving inventory may be understated or overstated 
if we change our estimate of future demand  we may have to increase or decrease our inventory valuation reserves for excess inventory  with a corresponding impact on cost of sales 
we continually review our inventory valuations for all of these factors 
however  
table of contents 
index to financial statements significant changes in manufacturing costs  unanticipated changes in product demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we regularly review our long lived assets for changes in circumstances indicating that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
we recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
we measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
as an example  we have moved assembly production offshore and consolidated our dallas operations 
this change in circumstances caused us to test for an impairment loss and ultimately record a million charge in fiscal related to fixed assets 
deferred tax assets in fiscal year we recorded a full asset valuation allowance against tax loss carryforwards and other tax benefits according to the sfas accounting for income taxes guidelines 
since then we have recorded no additional net federal tax benefits or expenses  since they were offset by the valuation allowance 
the only exception to this was in fiscal year when a change in tax law allowed us to collect a significant tax refund  which was recorded in the period in which the change in tax law occurred 
we still retain a large amount of potential tax benefits for tax loss carryforwards and other factors  as explained in the notes to the financial statements 
these benefits may be realized in future periods 
as a result  we do not expect to record significant federal income tax expense for some time 
accrued medical benefits we largely self insure the payment of medical benefits to our employees 
consequently we regularly estimate the value of unpaid benefits based upon historical trends and use that information to record our liability for benefits that have been incurred but not yet paid 
we have stop loss insurance protection to cover the costs of medical claims over certain deductible amounts for any given plan year for an individual claimant or in the aggregate 
however  medical claims may significantly and unexpectedly increase or decrease over a short period of time  in which case our liability for unpaid claims may no longer be accurate 
this could cause us to either increase or decrease medical expense in a material way in the period in which the change occurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the most part when we ship the product to the customer 
less than of fiscal sales were recognized under programs in which inventory is consigned to a customer 
we recognize sales from consigned products when the customer pulls the product for use from the consigned inventory 
in all cases  we recognize sales at the point at which legal title passes to the customer 
our standard terms and conditions are fob our factory 
we permit the return of defective products and accept limited amounts of product returns in other instances 
accordingly  we provide allowances for the estimated amounts of these returns based on historical experience when we recognize revenue

index to financial statements sales the following table displays sales for our different product lines and the percentage relationship of those product lines to total sales for the periods indicated year ended august  amount of total amount of total amount of total dollars in thousands product sales low power product group low power components virtual wire radio products subtotal communications products group frequency control modules filters subtotal total product sales technology development sales total sales overall sales trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our total sales were approximately the same in fiscal as they were in fiscal however  our individual product lines showed very different trends year over year 
our base business has been the low power components product line 
these products have accounted for well over half of our sales for many years 
the primary market for these products is the automotive market for keyless entry and tire pressure monitoring applications 
the automotive market is very price competitive and we have had to reduce average selling prices significantly this year to maintain our market position 
this is the primary reason why sales for this base business declined almost this year 
we expect the trend for lower average selling prices for low power components to continue  and may result in lower sales for these products in the future 
we have anticipated this potential trend for some time 
as a result  for several years we have focused our product and market development efforts on higher value products with technical content to allow them to be sold at higher average selling prices 
we had some success in increasing sales for these higher value product lines this year 
sales increased more than for these products  as we sold almost more units  including several new products that we will discuss below 
in the current year the decrease in our base business sales was just about equal to the increase in sales of higher value products  resulting in overall sales slightly less than the prior year 
we compete in very price competitive markets in which customers require decreased prices over time to maintain their business 
in addition  we understand that as new products ramp up in volume our customers expect economy of scale to result in lower pricing 
as a result  each of our product lines experienced a decline in average selling prices this year of or more 
this is a change from the prior year in which we did not experience significant decreases in average selling prices 
a decline in average selling prices adversely impacts gross margin  as well as sales 
therefore  offsetting this impact is an important part of our 
table of contents 
index to financial statements strategic plan 
we have achieved significant market position in most of the markets on which we focus 
however  we believe that price competition from much larger and better financed competitors represents a significant risk in maintaining our sales levels and gross margins  particularly the automotive market 
one of the biggest factors in determining what happens to total sales in the future will be whether or not the anticipated growth in higher value product line sales will be greater than or less than the anticipated decline in sales for our base low power components business 
we expect sales for our first quarter of fiscal to remain relatively flat 
this would be an improvement over the trend we have seen for the last two years of approximately fourth quarter to first quarter sales declines 
our sales success is highly dependent on the following factors achieving technological advances in our product design and manufacturing capabilities  our ability to sell our products in a competitive marketplace that can be influenced by outside factors  such as economic and regulatory conditions  competition from alternative technologies or from competitors duplicating the company s technologies  and the impact of competitive pricing 
these and other factors may adversely affect our ability to grow or even maintain our sales levels 
we have experienced sudden increases in demand in the past  which have put pressure on our manufacturing facilities and those of our offshore contractors to increase capacity to meet this demand 
in addition  new products sometimes require different manufacturing processes than we currently possess 
we may not be able to increase our manufacturing capacity  the manufacturing capacity of our assembly contractors  or improve our manufacturing processes in a timely manner so as to take advantage of increased market demand 
failure to do this could result in a material loss of potential sales 
overall sales trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year total sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold  which occurred in most of our product lines 
the decrease in the number of units sold was primarily due to the general economic slowdown  which occurred in most of our markets 
an economic downturn occurred in our largest market  the automotive market  although to a lesser extent than some other markets  such as the telecommunications market 
we believe that although progress was made in market acceptance of some of our newer products  overall sales for even some of those products was adversely impacted by adverse economic conditions for existing or potential customers in their markets 
despite participating in very price competitive markets  we did not experience a decrease in the average selling prices for our products within our various product lines 
in most cases  we were able to secure new business from new customers to replace business that was lost due to competitive pricing pressures 
product line sales trends sales for low power components products decreased in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in sales for the current year was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices in the very competitive automotive market  together with a decrease in the number of units sold 
the decrease in the number of units sold was mainly related to our older style to packaged products  which continue a trend of applications for those products either converting to surface mount versions or being lost to lower priced competitors 
the number of units sold of surface mount products was similar to the prior year  as sales for keyless entry applications decreased due to loss of some sales to alternative technologies  but that was offset by increased sales for tire pressure monitoring applications 
the decrease in fiscal sales was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units sold  mostly to automotive customers that were adversely affected by the general economic slowdown 
during the year  sales of low power components products 
table of contents 
index to financial statements fluctuated in accordance with changing production schedules for automotive customers 
we expect this fluctuation of low power components products sales with automotive production schedules to continue 
competitive pressures and consumer preferences in the low power components and filter markets caused us to change our marketing strategy in the third quarter 
we significantly accelerated the migration of these older version products to new smaller packages 
in addition  we modified our product line strategy by reallocating resources to support products in newer  smaller packages and discontinue selected products 
discontinued products resulted in a projected reduction in future sales 
we believe we have the package sizes available to meet or exceed competitive offerings and meet customer expectations 
we expect that the trend of lower average selling prices for low power component products to continue 
in addition  the trend toward lower to product sales is expected to continue 
we believe the number of units sold for tire pressure monitoring applications will continue to increase  partially offsetting these events 
we also believe the tread act  which mandates a growing number of new vehicles in the united states to have some form of tire pressure monitoring will continue to increase market demand 
our products support the direct conversion method of tire pressure monitoring 
there are competing technologies for meeting this requirement  which may impact our ability to benefit from the tread act legislation 
in addition  during fiscal we introduced more than new products in smaller packages which we expect will have increasing market acceptance in fiscal as a result of these various factors  we think low power components sales may decrease somewhat in the next fiscal year  despite the fact that the number of units sold may increase 
sales for virtual wire short range radio products increased in the current year  although they decreased in fiscal the increase in the current year was primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold for these products 
for several years we have devoted considerable resources developing and marketing new virtual wire short range radio products 
we believe these products offer potential for significant growth in sales in numerous new applications  particularly for applications that require small size and low power consumption 
in the current year automated meter reading applications and consumer sports applications showed large increases 
in the prior year the reduction in sales was primarily due to an almost complete elimination of sales of the first generation of these products  which were discontinued during fiscal sales of second generation products in fiscal were similar to fiscal we intend to continue working with our customers to develop new applications using virtual wire short range radio products and we expect future sales increases for these products 
however  the timing of any sales resulting from new applications is dependent upon the customers product development and product introduction cycles 
it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  new applications of products will have a significant impact on our sales 
we have seen that consumer applications are often part of special promotional programs by our customers  so sales to those customers will tend to fluctuate with the timing of those programs 
filter sales increased in fiscal  compared to a decrease of in fiscal in both years we sold an increased number of units  particularly for newer products in smaller packages that have lower average selling prices 
the unit increase was more than in fiscal and more than in fiscal in the current year  the increased number of units sold was mostly for a global positioning satellite consumer application and a new satellite radio application for the automotive market 
we have sold more than million satellite radio filters as of july and expect to sell our second million units by the end of the calendar year 
most of those sales were for the sirius satellite radio inc nasdaq siri applications 
we are working with both sirius and xm satellite radio holdings  inc nasdaq xmsr on next generation products 
we expect sales for the satellite radio application will continue to increase 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in the prior year our filter sales declined due to a decrease in average selling prices as a result of changes in product mix 
in fiscal the number of units sold of relatively high priced filters for telecommunications applications declined due to a severe downturn in economic conditions in that market 
the number of units sold of newer products in smaller packages increased  but not enough to offset the impact of a lower number of units sold for older telecommunications applications 
in recent years we have devoted a considerable portion of our engineering resources to filters and have developed many new products 
however  the product development and introduction cycle for filter products is largely under customers control 
as a result  it is difficult to predict whether or not the focus on filter products will continue to result in increased sales 
we believe the telecommunications market is currently very unpredictable due to the uncertain economic condition of that industry  and it is impossible to predict sales in that market with any precision 
frequency control module sales increased in fiscal  as compared to a decrease of in fiscal the increase in the current year was primarily due to an increased number of units sold to customers in high end computer markets 
the decrease in fiscal resulted from a decrease in the number of units sold of a line of optical timing products based upon patented technology that targets the optical dense wave division multiplex marketplace 
that segment of the telecommunications market was particularly hard hit by economic conditions 
while there were sales increases in these markets in fiscal  it is not known when  or if  a general economic recovery will occur for increases in sales for frequency control module products in other markets that have been very depressed in recent periods 
other sales trends the following table provides additional data concerning our sales percentage of sales sales for top five customers distribution sales number of customers with or more sales none one one sales for or more customer n a international sales our strategy is to seek diversification in our sales 
we believe we have achieved a significant level of diversification in our customers  markets  products and geographic areas 
however  due to the very competitive nature of the markets in which we compete  we may not always be able to achieve such diversification 
we consider all product sales with a delivery destination outside north america to be international sales 
these sales are denominated primarily in us currency  although some european customers require that we sell in euros 
we have not entered into any hedging activities to mitigate the exchange risk associated with sales in foreign currency 
we intend to continue our focus on international sales 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our business 
however  international sales are subject to fluctuations as a result of local economic conditions and competition 
therefore  we cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to derive similar levels of our business from international sales 
gross profit trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our current year cost of sales was million 
this included a million non cash charge of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory  as explained below 
the decrease in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements gross profit due to the inventory write down was partially offset by the continuation of cost reduction achieved as a result of our restructuring program 
we have moved most of our assembly production offshore and we have reduced our dallas  texas workforce as a result 
this has resulted in significantly lower ongoing production costs 
in the third quarter we changed our marketing strategy to significantly accelerate the migration of low power component and filter products to new  smaller packages 
we did this in response to an abrupt shift in market requirements toward smaller packages 
we experienced significant decreases in average selling prices for older style products in our second and third quarters and saw significant acceptance by customers of new products in smaller packages 
as a result  we modified our product line strategy by reallocating resources to support those newer products and by discontinuing selected products 
discontinued products resulted in a reduction of approximately in the number of products offered  with a projected reduction in future sales of less then 
the change in strategy and reduction in the number of products offered  as well as other factors  resulted in a million non cash charge related to the write down of inventory recorded as cost of sales on our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
we disposed of approximately million of written down inventory in the fourth quarter 
gross profit trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the gross margin increase in fiscal resulted from the gradual impact of our program to reduce manufacturing costs 
we transitioned volume assembly operations offshore to contract manufacturing companies over a two year period 
by the end of fiscal  this process was essentially complete 
as a result of the move of assembly operations offshore  we were able to reduce costs in our dallas  texas operations and our labor and overhead costs were considerably reduced from prior periods 
cost of sales for fiscal included million in special inventory charges related to elimination of product lines and transition to offshore manufacturing 
we also reduced cost by transitioning customers for our virtual wire short range radio products to more cost effective second generation products 
this was largely completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal the fiscal results represent purely second generation results  which were much improved over the prior fiscal year 
we realized additional cost savings through purchasing savings  process improvements and yield enhancements 
we devote considerable resources to improving both our remaining operations in dallas  texas and our offshore contractors 
factors influencing gross margins our gross margin continues to be influenced by several factors  some of which were unfavorable and some of which were favorable 
the most important unfavorable factors  some of which are outside our control  are as follows decrease in average selling prices as discussed above  there was a reduction in average selling prices in all of our product lines 
we expect that the trend toward lower average selling prices within our product lines will continue due to competitive pressures and the fact that newer products are reaching price breaks with increasing levels of volume 
impact of the non cash charge for obsolescence and write down of inventory explained above 
new products encounter ramp up costs associated with new manufacturing processes certain filter products during the year incurred process ramp up issues 
we will continue to introduce new products into our manufacturing processes  which are subject to the same types of issues  so there is no assurance that similar problems can be avoided in the future 

table of contents 
index to financial statements offsetting these unfavorable factors were other favorable factors that represent our long term efforts to improve gross margins and respond to these unfavorable factors 
the most important favorable factors are as follows our success at achieving ongoing cost reduction each of our product lines has achieved cost reduction on a per unit manufacturing cost basis in the current year compared to the prior year 
we also achieved cost reduction as we proceeded through the year 
for instance  during the year we have consolidated our pilot line production facility with its wafer fabrication facility  which resulted in approximately  in savings in the fourth quarter 
we intend to continue our efforts to reduce manufacturing costs in future periods 
shift in product mix our value added products  such as virtual wire short range radio products  frequency control modules and custom filters  have a greater long term potential for gross margins than the very price sensitive low power component products 
in the current year  these potentially higher margin products represented of total sales  compared to only in the previous year 
our strategy is to increase the portion of sales to products that have higher potential gross margins 
as part of that strategy  during the current year we formed a module group to integrate various technologies that blend our saw and rf design expertise with new packaging capabilities to form module products 
while this is our strategy  there is no way we can assure that such an improved product mix will be achieved in all future periods 
higher number of units sold this results in lower average unit cost due to relatively high fixed manufacturing costs being spread over a larger amount of sales 
however  if sales were to decrease in future periods  this factor could become an unfavorable factor 
the discussion above indicates that there are numerous factors that may have a material impact on our gross margins 
any one of them could cause a significant change in gross margin in either a favorable or unfavorable way  depending on the circumstances 
this makes long term estimates of our gross margin very difficult 
however  we believe that gross margins in the coming first quarter will remain at approximately of sales 
research and development research and development expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
research and development expense in fiscal increased approximately compared to a decrease of approximately in fiscal the slight increase in the current year was due to planned increases in design activities  including costs related to the development of a third generation of virtual wire short range radio products 
the prior year s decrease was primarily a result of our cost reduction program and reallocations from engineering design functions to manufacturing functions to improve manufacturing efficiency and to support the offshore transition 
we believe that the continued development of our technology and new products is essential to our success and we are committed to continuing our investment in research and development 
we expect our investments in research and development to remain approximately the same or increase in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses increased approximately 
the slight increase in the current year was due to planned increases in sales activities  including additional sales application support for our customers 
in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately from the prior year  due primarily to decreased sales commissions resulting from decreased sales and a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements change in our program to reduce commission rates 
sales and marketing expenses were of sales in fiscal and fiscal year we expect to incur comparable or slightly higher sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars over the next several quarters  with the exception of sales commission expenses that will fluctuate in line with sales levels 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to a decrease in fiscal year the decreases were part of our restructuring program 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain approximately the same in absolute dollars over the next several quarters 
restructuring and impairment expense in the current year  we identified additional opportunities to create efficiencies in our dallas  texas operations by consolidating our pilot line and wafer fabrication facilities into a recently purchased building that we had formerly leased 
for this and other reasons  we incurred non cash charges of million  which was primarily for equipment and other assets that will no longer be usable in our operations 
included in this charge was  in costs related to severance of employees 
the million charge was recorded as restructuring and impairment in our condensed consolidated statements of operations 
we expect to dispose of these assets over the next year 
restructuring and impairment expenses were approximately  in the prior year  which consisted of fixed asset write downs resulting from transfer of additional operations offshore 
we believe the restructuring and consolidation of our assembly operations is now complete and do not anticipate significant additional restructuring or impairment expense 
total operating expenses our operating expenses were million for the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was almost entirely due to the increase in restructuring and impairment expense as explained above 
total operating expenses had decreased million in the prior year 
while some of the decrease in the prior year was due to lower sales commissions resulting from lower sales  most of the decrease was a result of our cost reduction efforts 
we intend to continue our program to control operating expenses 
therefore  we do not expect operating expenses to change materially over the next several quarters  other than making a small amount of strategic product and market development investments intended to help increase sales 
in addition  we expect sales commission expense to fluctuate in line with sales 
other income expense other income expense  primarily interest expense on our bank debt  decreased  in the current year and  in the prior year 
this was primarily due in both years to a lower amount borrowed  as well lower interest rates 
we have paid down net bank debt by approximately million in the current year and million in the prior year 
we expect to continue to pay down our bank debt  and expect these expenses to continue to decrease next year 
loss before income taxes loss before income taxes increased to million in the current year  compared to a million loss for the prior year and a million loss in fiscal the increased current year loss was primarily due to million in non cash charges to cost of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory and to operating expenses for restructuring and impairment expenses as explained above 
the improvement in fiscal year compared to fiscal was primarily a result of improved gross profit and reduced operating expenses and reflects the positive impact of our restructuring program 

table of contents 
index to financial statements income tax expense benefit in the current year we recorded a small provision for state income tax and expect to record relatively small state income tax provisions in future periods 
in the prior year we benefited from a change in legislation that allowed us to obtain tax refunds for taxes paid in additional prior periods and additional categories of taxes 
as a result  we recorded a  income tax benefit in fiscal  which was subsequently received 
in fiscal  we fully reserved  in a non cash charge  all tax benefits that had been recorded prior to that point in accordance with fas this resulted in million in income tax expense for fiscal we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets due to prior period losses  as well as the general economic environment 
however  we retain the tax benefits involved and we will realize the benefit in future periods to the extent we are profitable 
as of the end of the current year  we have income tax carry forwards and other potential tax benefits available to reduce future federal taxable income by approximately million as explained in footnote to our financial statements 
the net operating loss carry forward begins to expire august  we do not expect to receive any additional tax refunds from recent legislation and do not expect to record any future federal income tax benefits or expense until the recovery of deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
loss per share the net loss for the current year was million  compared to a  loss in the prior year and a million loss for fiscal our basic and diluted loss per share was 
for fiscal  compared to 
per share for fiscal and per share for fiscal the increased loss in the current year was primarily due to million in non cash charges to cost of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory and to operating expenses for restructuring and impairment expenses as explained above 
the improvement in loss per share in fiscal was due to both a an improvement in gross margins and operating expenses as a result of our restructuring efforts  as well as b a million tax refund in fiscal  compared to a million expense for a fas special charge in fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal unaudited quarterly financial data is presented in note to the accompanying financial statements 
sales for the fourth quarter of million decreased approximately  compared to million in the comparable quarter of the prior year 
sales increased approximately compared to the previous third quarter 
the sales decrease in the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  despite a slight increase in the number of units sold 
see the above discussion under the heading product line sales trends for more details on the impact of average selling prices on our sales and gross margins 
our sales increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to a strong increase in the number of units sold  particularly to automotive customers for tire pressure monitoring and satellite radio applications 
for the last two years  our sales have declined an average of in our first quarter compared to the previous fourth quarter 
we expect that sales for tire pressure monitoring and satellite radio applications to offset this decline and overall sales for the next quarter will remain relatively flat with the current quarter 
we currently cannot make any estimate of sales beyond the next quarter  due to the uncertain economic environment and the lack of visibility from customers in terms of backlog 
we feel the diversity of our product offering and customer base moderates to a great extent the impact of economic changes on any particular industry or market 

table of contents 
index to financial statements gross profit margin was in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and for the previous quarter 
the primary reason for the decrease in gross margin from the comparable quarter of the prior year was our product mix within the low power components line was not quite as favorable as it was last year 
the primary reason for the increase in gross margin from the previous quarter was our third quarter million non cash charge of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory  as explained above under the heading gross profit trends in fiscal year compared to fiscal year 
we expect that gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal will remain at approximately of sales 
operating expenses for the fiscal fourth quarter were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the comparable quarter of the prior year and million for the previous quarter 
most of the variations in operating expenses were due to fluctuations in restructuring and impairment expense 
the current quarter had no restructuring and impairment expense  compared to  in the prior year and million in the previous quarter 
these charges were described above 
without restructuring and impairment expense  operating expenses for the fourth quarter were not significantly changed from either the comparable quarter of the prior year or the previous quarter 
we expect that operating expenses will remain stable over the next several quarters  except for sales commission expenses  which will change in line with sales levels 
other expense was  in the fiscal fourth quarter  compared to  in the comparable quarter of the prior year and  in the previous quarter 
this was primarily due to a lower amount borrowed  as well as due to lower interest rates 
the decrease from the previous quarter was magnified by the fact that the current quarter also included a small amount of gains on sales of fixed assets  while the previous quarter included a small loss on sales of fixed assets 
we expect that projected positive cash flow may allow us to continue to pay down debt  so interest expense may continue to decrease in the next year 
pre tax income for the fiscal fourth quarter was  compared to  in the comparable quarter of the prior year and a loss of million in the previous quarter 
the current quarter increase from the comparable quarter of the prior year resulted from lower operating and non operating expenses as explained in the previous two paragraphs 
this was the highest pretax income we have reported in four years and we feel represents the favorable impact of our restructuring program 
the increase from the previous quarter primarily results from the fact that the previous quarter included million in non cash charges to cost of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory and to operating expenses for restructuring and impairment expenses that did not recur 
income tax expense was nearly the same for the current quarter  the comparable quarter of the prior year and the previous quarter 
diluted net income per share was in the fourth quarter  compared to for the comparable quarter of the prior year and a loss of for the previous quarter 
net income followed the same pattern as pre tax income see discussion above 
the number of shares outstanding increased in the current quarter due to an increase in stock price that put more stock options in the money

this real estate term note requires monthly principal payments of  plus interest  which began in march the banking agreement calls for an interest rate of bank prime plus 
substantially all our assets  tangible and intangible  are pledged as collateral 
the banking agreement contains financial covenants relating to various matters  including but not limited to a minimum net worth  b quarterly and monthly earnings  c limitations on changes in corporate structure and d restrictions on dividends and capital spending 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of august  although we believe that we will be able to continue compliance with the covenants  there is no assurance that this will occur 
should there be a covenant violation and we are unable to negotiate a waiver or amendment  the maturity of our debt could be accelerated 
in that case  other sources of cash would be needed to support our operations 
the banking agreement will expire in december as part of the may amendment  we entered into a warrant purchase agreement with the lender 
we issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the closing price of our common stock as of may  was per share 
the warrants expire years from date of issuance 
we accounted for the fair value assigned to these warrants of  as a debt issuance cost and we are amortizing it over the remaining period of the banking agreement 
cash flows liquidity at august  consisted primarily of  of cash and approximately million available under the banking agreement 
net cash provided by our operating activities was million in the current year  the same as the prior year 
while net income was million lower in fiscal  the non cash items included in net income were million higher 
working capital used in operations declined by approximately  primarily because the reduction pay down in accounts payables was approximately million lower 
we continued to be within payment terms with our vendors in fiscal we reduced both inventory and receivables in both years 
collection of our receivables improved on a days sales outstanding measurement to the low to mid day range in the current year 
receivables declined more last year due to lower sales 
inventory decreased more last year as offshore contractors took over a portion of the responsibility for raw materials 
there are some unusual factors included in the cash flows over the last two years 
both net income and non cash items included in net income in the current year incorporate the effect of the million non cash charges to cost of sales for obsolescence and write down of inventory and to operating expenses for

index to financial statements restructuring and impairment expenses that were mentioned above 
the prior year included the benefit of a  tax refund 
depreciation was approximately million lower in fiscal year as a result of assets reaching the end of their lives and the various fixed asset write downs we have reported 
we expect depreciation will decrease another million next year for the same reasons 
we expect to maintain a positive cash flow from operations for fiscal  as we did in the last two years 
we have classified all of our bank debt  except for the long term portion of the mortgage  as current on our year end balance sheet 
this reflects our plan to pay down more bank debt in fiscal than required under the loan s repayment terms 
we believe continued positive cash flow  as well as access to our credit facilities  will be sufficient to maintain normal operations for the next fiscal year 
however  we cannot guarantee this will be achieved 
cash used in investing activities was million in the current year  compared to cash provided from investing activities of million for the prior year 
this was primarily due to capital spending of approximately million in the current year 
the bulk of our capital spending was for the purchase of a building for million that we had formerly leased and improvements to that building that allowed us to consolidate a substantial part of our dallas operations into our acquired building 
we had cash provided from investing activities resulting from the proceeds of sales of fixed assets in both years 
we will continue our efforts to sell fixed assets that were idled in recent years 
we expect to acquire up to million of capital equipment by the end of fiscal  primarily related to the development of new products and new manufacturing processes 
due to our offshore manufacturing initiative  we do not expect to need significant additions to our assembly facilities or equipment in the next year 
we used million in net cash in financing activities in  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal approximately million was used to reduce bank borrowings  compared to million in the prior year 
in the current year we used a million mortgage to help finance the building we purchased 
under our banking agreement  all receipts are applied to loans that are outstanding and we borrow funds to support all of our activities 
as a result  repayments on debt and borrowings are large relative to our sales 
we raised  from sales of stock to employees under various stock programs in fiscal as of august   we had approximately million of cash availability under our banking agreement based upon the borrowing base 
in addition  approximately million more may become available under the banking agreement if our borrowing base were to increase sufficiently to support increased borrowing 
we are not able to say when or if that will happen because of our inability to see very far into the future due to limited lead times on orders placed with us by our customers 
while we reported positive operating cash flows for the last nine quarters  a reduction in sales or gross margins could occur due to economic or other factors 
we believe that cash generated from operations  our cash balances and the amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
if for any reason these sources of funds are not sufficient to meet our requirements  we may be required to raise additional funds 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to obtain additional financing or  if available  that it would be available to us on acceptable terms 
should that happen  there could be a significant adverse impact on our operations

stock options a stock option program description our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented personnel and align stockholder and employee interests 
we currently have four plans plan  plan  plan and director plan under which we grant stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
the options generally vest at a rate of one forty eighth each month beginning the first day of the month following the date of grant 
the exercise price of each option equals the market price of our stock on the date of grant and each option generally expires ten years after the date of grant 
the plan expired for future grants according to its terms in november the director plan will expire as well in april in the near future we plan to grant most options and restricted stock to employees and directors from our plan 
we currently account for our option plans under apb and  accordingly  do not recognize compensation expense for options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to consultants are accounted for under sfas and are valued using the black scholes model 
compensation expense of those options is recognized over the vesting life of the options  which is aligned with the consulting service life 
we also use the plan to grant restricted stock 
the grants are considered issued stock when granted and certificates are presented to the grantee as vesting occurs 
we record unearned compensation  valued using the black scholes model based on the share price on the date of grant  and expense that compensation over the vesting period

index to financial statements the percentage of total options granted to employees is based on an aggregate of  options granted to our employees  consultants and directors during the year ended august   including our named executive officers 
the exercise price per share of each option is equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
the potential realizable value is calculated based on the term of the option at its time of grant ten years 
it is calculated by assuming that the stock price on the date of grant appreciates at the indicated annual rate compounded annually for the entire term of the option  and that the option is exercised and sold on the last day of its term for the appreciated stock price 
no gain to the optionee is possible unless the stock price increases over the option term  which will benefit the stockholder

forward looking statements except for the historical information  this report contains numerous forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could and will differ materially from the statements and assumptions discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below  as well as in the sections entitled business  legal proceedings  selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
this report and other presentations made by us contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions and our expectations at the time 
however  these statements involve uncertainties and are completely qualified by reference to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to the following items that are listed below 
any and all of these factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements that we made the impact of competitive products and pricing 
we do business in extremely competitive markets that are noted for fierce competition and generally declining average selling prices 
most of our significant competitors are much larger and better financed than we are 
these competitors could execute sales strategies that could take a considerable amount of our business very quickly 
this could have a material adverse impact on both our sales results and gross margins 
the timely development  acceptance and pricing of new products 
we have a large amount of continuing sales of older products that tend to decline in popularity over time 
only by developing new products can we replace sales for declining products and partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices 
the impact of competing technologies including the obsolescence of existing products 
our business has a considerable amount of technological risk 
we are vulnerable to competitors that have much more resources than we do that are trying to develop products that are technologically superior to ours 
if customers believe those products are superior to ours  they may shift their demand to them 
the ability to obtain production material and labor and capacity to meet product demand 
shortages could occur that make us unable to take advantage of a sudden increase or even stable level of demand 
the potential transition to value added products 
our historical base business is declining 
only by successfully developing and introducing value added products to our customers can we offset this impact 
the timely implementation of improved manufacturing processes and transition to offshore manufacturing 
we need to constantly reduce our costs to offset the impacts of a reduction in our average selling prices 
we need to do this through continuous cost reduction in both our facilities and those of our contractors 
general economic conditions as they affect our customers and manufacturing contractors 
our customers and contractors do business in markets that are vulnerable to changes in economic conditions 
adverse economic conditions can adversely impact the demand and or the ability to supply our products

if we have unanticipated difficulties  our banking relationships and other means of financing could be jeopardized 
general industry trends 
markets or customer preferences could move away from our products 
acts of war or terrorism as they affect us  our customers or our manufacturing partners 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement was made  and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement was made  nor will we necessarily make statements in advance to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors 
we cannot assess the impact of each new or old factor on our business 
we also cannot determine the extent to which a factor or combination of factors might cause future results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of august   with all other variables held constant  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
a significant portion of our products have a manufacturing process in foreign jurisdictions and are sold in foreign jurisdictions 
we manage our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
however  we may facilitate a minor portion of our sales in euros 
we consider the amount of our foreign currency exchange rate risk to be immaterial as of august
