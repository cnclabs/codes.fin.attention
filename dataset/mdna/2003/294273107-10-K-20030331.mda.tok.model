overview epoch develops technology and products that enable and accelerate genomic analysis 
the foundation of our business strategy is the continued funding of innovative research and development and commercialization of the resultant products through a number of channels 
we earn revenues through a variety of sources 
we license our technology for incorporation into other companies products and generate product revenue and earn license fees and royalties from those 
table of contents companies 
we also sell our products to end users  both through our direct sales force and through distributors that provide worldwide reach 
we also earn revenues through contract research activities  whereby third party companies pay for specific research and development activities carried out by our scientists 
in january  epoch and applied biosystems entered into a license and supply agreement pursuant to which we licensed some of our technology to applied biosystems for use in taqman nuclease real time pcr assays  or tests 
under the terms of the agreement  applied biosystems made payments to us of initial fees for licensed technology and proprietary know how  and will make ongoing payments for purchases of chemical compounds as well as royalties on sales of product which use the licensed technology  subject to minimums 
in july  we licensed our proprietary software  which speeds the design of chemical tools used in the study of genes  to applied biosystems 
this agreement increased the scope of the licensing agreement entered into in january with applied biosystems to include software that allows for the efficient custom design of taqman probes  which are chemical compounds which seek out  or probe for a specific location on a gene  by the end user 
the software is incorporated into applied biosystems primer express software which is sold with its sequence detection system 
in addition to license fees  we receive royalties on all products that applied biosystems sells which incorporate the software 
in november  applied biosystems converted  of prepayments made by it pursuant to the license and supply agreement into  shares of our common stock 
in order to secure any unused portion of the purchased product prepayments up to  we continued to grant to applied biosystems a security interest in the patents related to the technology under the terms of a security agreement 
the security interest automatically terminates when any unused portion of the purchased product prepayments is  or less 
although no security interest was granted with respect to the royalty prepayments  if the royalty payments do not become due under the agreement  we will also be required to refund any unused prepayments to applied biosystems  which approximates  at december  in august  the agreement was amended to include research and development funding of  per year  subject to adjustment under terms of the agreement 
this portion of the agreement expired in august of  and we are not currently doing research work for applied biosystems 
in october  we further amended our agreement with applied biosystems 
under the terms of this amendment  applied biosystems paid us a minimum amount each quarter for their right to order  and our obligation to manufacture  probes for them 
this amendment was effective from october through october in july  a further amendment removed the manufacturing rights from the contract effective october  redefined product categories  increased the minimum royalties and royalty rates  and established that minimum royalties are measured and paid quarterly 
under the terms of the agreement  if applied biosystems terminates the agreement upon days written notice to us  or if we terminate the agreement following a material breach by applied biosystems  applied biosystems will release its security interest in the patents and forfeit any unused portion of the prepayments 
however  if we and applied biosystems mutually agree to terminate the agreement  or if applied biosystems terminates the agreement as a result of a material breach by us  then we must reimburse applied biosystems the difference between the unused portion of the purchased product prepayments and  which approximates  at december  
table of contents in october  we entered into a development  license and supply agreement with third wave technologies whereby we licensed our proprietary fluorescent dye and quencher technologies to third wave 
third wave also has the option to license other proprietary chemistries we have  in which case additional license and royalty fees would be due to us 
we received an initial license fee which is being amortized over the life of the contract and we receive royalties on sales of third wave products which include the licensed technology 
included in the agreement with third wave was a collaborative research effort to be funded by third wave through december  in third wave informed us that it was ceasing funding development with us 
we instituted arbitration proceedings against third wave and in march agreed that third wave would no longer be obligated to fund development 
in exchange  third wave agreed to pay us  of which  was included in accounts receivable at december   and third wave also agreed to higher annual minimum royalties under its license from us for dye and quencher technologies 
in november  we acquired some of the assets and liabilities of synthetic genetics  a san diego  california manufacturer of specialty oligonucleotides for approximately  including  in cash paid  the direct costs of the acquisition  and the assumption of liabilities 
the acquisition provided us with manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated order volumes generated by the applied biosystems contract 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a business and resulted in the recognition of goodwill of approximately  and other intangibles of approximately  in july  we launched our mgb eclipse probe system  that incorporates the performance advantages of our unique mgb and mgb eclipse dark quencher technologies 
mgb eclipse probe assays are compatible with all currently manufactured real time pcr systems  and provide highly effective and reproducible results for academic  biotech  diagnostic and pharmaceutical researchers 
the initial release consisted of mgb eclipse probes for gene expression  viral detection  and allelic discrimination for single nucleotide polymorphisms snp s 
in october  we entered into a license  development  and supply alliance with incyte genomics  inc the alliance consists of three elements 
first  we will receive access to the gene sequence content from incyte s lifeseq gold and zooseq databases for use in the design  manufacture  and sale of mgb eclipse probe products 
second  under the alliance we will be identified as the preferred provider of custom oligonucleotides and other proprietary hybridization probes to incyte s users of lifeseq gold 
third  we will supply incyte with mgb eclipse probe systems for their internal development purposes 
in july  we named amersham biosciences our exclusive worldwide sales and marketing partner of mbg eclipse probe systems to the research field for snps  and the co exclusive worldwide sales and marketing partner to the research field for gene expression 
under terms of the distribution agreement  amersham promotes and markets co branded custom and catalogue mgb eclipse products as part of its genomics product portfolio to researchers in the life science industry and to pharmaceutical companies conducting internal research 
in october  we named qiagen nv a co exclusive worldwide sales and marketing partner to the research field for products that incorporate our mgb eclipse probe systems for gene expression 
we supply components to qiagen and qiagen will offer custom and catalogue probe systems as part of its gene expression product offerings to be launched in under both agreements  our mgb eclipse design software is available from the partner s website to enable customers to rapidly design and order mgb eclipse probes and primers specifically for a gene of interest 
both of these agreements are restricted to the research field 
we retain all other rights to mgb eclipse probe systems in other fields  including diagnostics  bioterroism  and bio warfare 

table of contents we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next year as we continue research and development spending in applying our synthetic dna based technology to genomic analysis to the research and other fields  and incur costs commercializing the resultant products through various channels 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policy is revenue recognition 
revenue recognition 
we earn revenues from product sales of chemical products and reagents to manufacturers for incorporation into their products  from the sale of specialty oligonucleotides and value added reagents to end users and distributors in the research fields of genomics and molecular diagnostics  from license fees for the use of our proprietary technology and know how  and by providing services to third parties for performing research and development on their behalf 
we also have product royalty agreements that result in royalties to us upon ultimate sales of products by our partners 
revenues from product sales that require no ongoing obligations are recognized when shipped to the customer and title has passed 
to the extent that sales are made to distributors and not sold through to end users our future sales could decline 
license fees are recognized over the term of the agreement to which the license fees correspond  which may extend to the expiration of the underlying patents  and based on the terms and future performance obligations in the underlying agreements 
these upfront fees are generally nonfundable regardless of future performance 
deferred revenue principally represents these license fees received in advance and prepayments for product purchases 
contract research revenues are recognized as the research and development activities are performed under the terms of commercial collaboration and supply agreements and government grants 
direct costs related to these contracts and grants are reported as research and development expenses 
royalty revenues are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements  which is generally upon sale of products by our partner containing our component products 
to the extent our partners no longer use our component products or sales of their products are less than expected  our royalty revenues could decrease in the future 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  in thousands revenue product sales license fees and royalty income contract research revenue total revenue cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative interest income  net net loss vs 
revenues for the year ended december   increased over  primarily due to increases in product sales and royalties 
product sales 
product sales include sales of specialty oligonucleotides to end users and our distribution partners in the research market and sales of chemical intermediates and our dyes  quencher  and modified bases to collaborative partners and distributors 
product sales increased to  in from  in  reflecting increased sales of mgb eclipse probe systems  including initial shipments to worldwide marketing partners amersham biosciences and qiagen  and increases in sales of other custom oligonucleotides and chemical intermediates to corporate partners 
revenue from the sale of specialty oligonucleotides grew significantly in for three primary reasons 
first  sales of mgb eclipse probe systems increased due to a full year of shipments to incyte and initial shipments in the third and fourth quarters to amersham and qiagen pursuant to our distribution agreements 
in  we had limited revenue from incyte and no shipments to amersham or qiagen 
second  one of our major customers for specialty oligonucleotides relocated one of its manufacturing facilities during the year and outsourced the work to us during the move 
we had sales of approximately  from this customer in and we do not currently expect to receive this level of sales in third  revenues from applied biosystems for mgb taqman probe manufacturing increased 
these manufacturing rights ceased in september pursuant to the most recent amendment to that agreement  with the value of those rights recharacterized as product royalties 
chemical intermediate revenues represent component chemistries that we supply on cost plus terms for incorporation in our partners products and sales of our dyes  quencher  and modified bases through distributors 
these revenues increased in as a result of growth in our shipments to applied biosystems in support of their assays on demand and assays by design product launches 
initial shipments of our dyes  quencher  and modified bases to our new distribution partners also contributed to the increase in these revenues 
license fees and royalty income 
license fees reflect the amortization of initial payments for technology and know how transfers 
these amounts are amortized over the life of the contract 
royalty 
table of contents income represents the royalty amounts under license agreements 
license fees and royalty income increased to  in from  in as the result of higher product sales by corporate partners and contractual minimums 
in the fourth quarter of  we received the last annual minimum royalty payment from applied biosystems under the agreement in effect through september  also during that quarter  we accrued the first quarterly minimum royalty amount pursuant to the amended agreement that became effective october  the resultant recognition of two minimum royalty amounts from applied biosystems in the same quarter is unlikely to recur 
while the quarterly minimum royalty amounts from applied biosystems increase modestly quarter over quarter under the amended agreement  we expect quarterly royalties from applied biosystems in to be less than we recognized in the fourth quarter of contract research revenue 
contract research revenue primarily reflects payments for contract research and development performed for our corporate partners 
contract research revenues decreased from  in to  in due to the expiration of the applied biosystems research contract in august and suspended activity in the third wave technologies research contract in april  offset by increases in funded research activities that centered on applications for our mgb eclipse technologies 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales represents the manufacturing costs of material  labor and overhead allocations associated with product sales 
also included is the cost of outside manufacturers which we use to produce some of our chemical intermediates 
the cost of product sales increased to  in compared to  in the prior year 
costs as a percentage of product sales decreased from in to for the current year 
increases in costs of product sales are generally tied to the increases in revenues  while the changes in costs as a percentage of product sales are generally impacted by the product mix and economies of scale resulting from higher volumes 
the selling prices of our chemical intermediates  for example  are determined by contracts and are tied to fully burdened manufacturing costs  which means our gross margin is fixed at levels below those generally found in the commercial marketplace 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of product sales experienced in is the result of three factors economies of scale driven by the increase in product sales  a different product mix  specifically higher mgb eclipse revenues  and the impact of changes in manufacturing processes which are resulting in lower costs 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased  or  in compared to significant changes in research and development costs were impacted by an increase in payroll expenses of  which primarily resulted from the addition of a senior vice president of research and development early in  severance payments for staff reductions late in the year  and higher health insurance and other employee benefit costs 
reduced expenses of  incurred for the recruitment and relocation of senior scientific personnel compared to we utilize our research and development personnel in manufacturing during periods of high demand 
the use of research and development personnel was  higher in over  and will fluctuate depending on the time and availability of personnel to conduct research and development activities 
this amount was offset by increased 
table of contents purchases of raw materials which were primarily attributable to chemical intermediate manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in over the increase in was primarily the result of selling and marketing expenses increased  as we continued our efforts to establish mgb eclipse probe systems and gain product market share in the specialty oligonculeotide field through the addition of sales and product marketing personnel and print advertising programs 
licensing expenses increased  resulting from our increased royalty revenues 
personnel costs increased  in our san diego facility as we changed staffing to meet customer needs  including the addition of a vice president of operations 
legal expenses increased  during the year for various general corporate matters including the completion of agreements with amersham and qiagen 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  in was lower than due to reduced cash balances available for investment  lower interest rates  and higher interest expense as a result of our new term loans to silicon valley bank in late vs 
product sales 
product sales began in and represent the sale of chemical intermediates and probes  primarily to collaborative partners  and the sale of specialty oligonucleotides to the research market from our san diego facility 
chemical intermediate revenues  primarily to applied biosystems and third wave technologies  represent component chemistries that we supply on cost plus terms for incorporation in our partners products 
these revenues increased in as a result of growth in our shipments to applied biosystems  and the start of shipments to third wave 
revenue growth in our specialty oligonucleotide business grew significantly in for two primary reasons 
first  revenues from the taqman mgb probes and other products manufactured for applied biosystems pursuant to our license and supply agreement  as amended  began in early second  because of the acquisition of synthetic genetics in november  calendar results include sales of specialty oligonucleotides for a complete twelve month year  while results includes only six weeks specialty oligonucleotide sales 
license fees and royalty income 
license fees reflect the amortization of initial payments for technology and know how transfers 
these amounts are amortized over the life of the contract 
royalty income represents the royalties received under license agreements 
royalties in increased significantly over the prior year as a result of increased sales of products incorporating our technologies by our licensees and receipt of contractual minimum payments during the year 
contract research revenue 
contract research revenue in reflects payments for contract research and development performed under the applied biosystems agreement for four months of the year 
in  contract research revenue primarily reflects contract research under our agreements with applied biosystems and third wave technologies for the full year 

table of contents cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales represents the direct manufacturing costs of material  labor and overhead allocations associated with product sales 
also included is the cost of outside manufacturers which we use to produce some of our chemical intermediates 
the increased costs in are attributable to the increase in product sales and changes in the product mix due to the addition of our san diego operations and increased volumes of chemical intermediates at contractual margins 
research and development 
research and development costs increased  or  in over this increase was primarily driven by an increase of  in facility costs as we occupied our new laboratory space in late an increase in payroll expenses of  which primarily resulted from increased staffing over levels 
expenses of  incurred for the recruitment and relocation of senior scientific personnel 
we also incurred an increase of  in research and development expenses in our san diego operation as it was functional for a full year in compared to six weeks of the prior year 
we use our research and development personnel in manufacturing during periods of high demand 
the use of research and development personnel was  higher in over  and will fluctuate depending on the time and availability of personnel to conduct research and development activities 
this amount was offset by increased purchases of raw materials which were primarily attributable to chemical intermediate manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in over the increases in were primarily the result of  in selling and marketing expenses associated with our entry into the specialty oligonculeotide field and the addition of sales and marketing personnel 
the addition of a full year of operations in san diego which added  to general and administrative expenses 
approximately  in compensation expenses related to additional executive personnel 
interest income  net 
interest income  net  in was lower than due to reduced cash balances available for investment coupled with lower interest rates in interest expense in and are minimal and represent the interest payments under capital leases which were assumed as part of the synthetic genetics acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had operating cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at december   a decrease of in  cash used in operations totaled  basically representing our decrease in cash for the year 
within operations  our net loss of  and the aggregate change in working capital accounts of  were the primary components  offset by non cash expenses such as depreciation 
table of contents and amortization amounting to  during the year  we financed most of our capital expenditures through a new term loan credit facility with silicon valley bank 
other sources and uses of cash in were not significant 
of the significant use of cash caused by changes in our working capital accounts  accounts receivable increased  substantially all of which has been collected  as a result of the timing of product sales in december and the accrual of contractual minimum royalties due from applied biosystems at december  inventories increased  as the result of our decision to have higher levels of finished chemical intermediates inventory on hand to meet the needs of our customers 
increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are the result of normal business fluctuations of a growing company 
deferred revenue  representing up front licensing payments subject to recognition over the terms of the underlying agreements and prepayments for royalties and product purchases  also impacts cash flows from operations 
deferred revenue decreased during  thereby increasing our cash used in operations  due to normal amortizations and the offset of royalty and product prepayments by our customers  reduced by the receipt of a portion of the technology access fee from qiagen as part of our license and distribution agreement 
cash used in investing activities decreased to  in compared to  in due primarily to lower levels of capital expenditures and license rights payments 
cash provided by financing activities increased to  in from  in due to proceeds from borrowings from our new credit facility offset by lower proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
in september  we finalized a term loan facility of up to  to finance manufacturing equipment and other assets and a working capital line of credit of up to  from a commercial bank 
funds may be drawn on the equipment facility at any time through june   and on the working capital line of credit at any time through august advances under the term loan and working capital line of credit are secured by a first position security interest in our assets excluding intellectual property 
amounts advanced under term loans are repayable in monthly payments of principal and interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
on the working capital line of credit  interest is payable monthly on any unpaid balances at the bank s prime rate plus  with principal payable in full in september as of december   we have  of available financing under the term loan and  available from the working capital line of credit 
in  cash used in operations amounted to  our net loss of  was offset by non cash depreciation and amortization charges of  and by an increase in deferred revenue caused by receipt of new license fees and advance payments from customers of  cash used in investing activities was  in  consisting of the license rights of   in facilities and equipment  including  of december purchases  and  of costs associated with the synthetic genetics acquisition 
the increase in accounts receivable balances from to is the result of increased product sales in the reduction in accounts payable in is primarily the result of the payout of  in the equipment and leasehold improvements related to the synthetic genetics acquisition in late accrued liabilities increased in over primarily as a result of payroll and employee benefit costs  the majority of which were paid in january and february at december   our largest cash commitments are non cancelable operating leases for facilities in the amount of  that expire in in addition  we have commitments to supply products to customers in the amount of  which have been paid for in advance 

table of contents capital expenditures were significantly lower in than levels  however further investments in capital expenditures may be necessary to facilitate our anticipated growth in operations 
we may also require a larger inventory of raw materials and products to provide better service to our customers 
any such increases  net of any amounts drawn against available credit facilities  can be expected to reduce cash and cash equivalents 
we currently anticipate that existing cash balances  projected cash from operations and unused borrowing capacity under existing bank loans will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures through at least our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to magnitude of our future losses  timing and terms of new technology licensing agreements or other strategic relationships that may provide up front license fees or other payments  resources that we devote to research and development and sales and marketing in support of our business strategy  and capital expenditures necessary to expand manufacturing capacity 
it is possible that we may need to raise additional capital to fund our activities and or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we may be able to raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our shareholders and us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
aggregate contractual obligations in addition to the debt obligations reflected on our balance sheet  we have commitments associated with operating leases 
the following is a summary of these cash obligations and commitments as of december  scheduled payments under contractual obligations in thousands within after year years years years total long term obligations operating leases recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  as well as all purchase method business combinations completed after june  statement requires that goodwill and 
table of contents intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement epoch adopted the provisions of statement immediately and statement effective january  as of the date of adoption  epoch had unamortized goodwill in the amount of  and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of  all of which were subject to the transition provisions of statements and amortization expense related to goodwill was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in november  the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issued its consensus concerning revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  and  if separation is appropriate  how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the identified accounting units 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not anticipate that adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements for guarantor s disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and which remain outstanding 
the interpretation also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken by the guarantor at the inception of the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the disclosure requirements are currently effective  while the recognition and initial measurement provisions will apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that these provisions will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  for public enterprises  such as the company  with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   the interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the end of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and short term investment grade debt securities 
we also have term loans on capital equipment through a commercial bank 
at december  and the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
we do not believe that fluctuations in interest rates would have a material impact on us 
it is 
table of contents our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as our international transactions are minimal and the majority of our international transactions are denominated in us currency 
accordingly  we do not have significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk at december  in the future  under the terms of the qiagen agreement  we will be conducting some of our business in euros for qiagen sales in europe and in yen for qiagen sales in japan 
we do not anticipate that these transactions will create significant exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
