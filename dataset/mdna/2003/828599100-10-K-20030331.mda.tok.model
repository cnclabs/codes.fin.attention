item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by the company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a prolonged worldwide recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced throughout and  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results were adversely impacted by the severe instabilities experienced during the last months in the telecommunication industry as well as a general downturn in the us economy over the preceding year 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish the timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use electronic data interchange edi with both our customers and our suppliers in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements  as well as sharing our future requirements with our suppliers 
we depend on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture 
see electronic manufacturing industry and supplies and materials management under item  business and results of operations below 
we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced in and  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein

the decrease in inventory turnover is primarily due to the continued slowdown in sales to our cable and wiring customers during as compared to cash flows used in investing activities increased approximately  in to  as compared to approximately  in the increase in investing activities was primarily due to leasehold improvements of approximately  required due to the relocation of our massachusetts facilities from milford to attleboro in april of the company has a capital expenditure budget of  for cash flow used in financing activities was approximately  in as compared to cash flow used in of approximately  the cash flow was used to reduce the company s long term loan from the bank of scotland and to fund a short term loan to simclar 
on october   the company entered into two credit facilities with bank of scotland in edinburgh  scotland for an aggregate borrowing of  this financing replaced the lines of credit and three commercial loans with the provident bank of ohio  for techdyne and lytton 
the financing included a  line of credit  expiring july   with an interest rate at libor rate plus for a one  three or six month period  at the company s election 
the company elected the one month interest period at as of december  this line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december  the financing also included a seven year term loan of  at the same interest rate as the line of credit 
the term loan is priced at the libor interest rate plus for a one  three or six month period  at the company s election 
the company elected the three month interest period at until january   after this date the rate is until april  the term loan requires quarterly payments of  in january  april  july and october of each year  plus interest 
the term loan had an outstanding balance of approximately  at december  the company  based on discussions with bank of scotland  believes the  line of credit will be renewed through july  should such renewal not occur  the company would have the adverse effect of repaying the line of credit and would seek alternative financing 
all of the assets of techdyne and lytton collateralize the credit facilities 
the credit facilities require affirmative and negative covenants 
certain of the affirmative covenants require maintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth greater than  after december    after june  and  after september   ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated net borrowing not less than to  a ratio of consolidated trade receivables to consolidated net borrowings not less than 
to  and a ratio of consolidated net income before interest and income taxes to total consolidated interest costs not less than to some of the negative covenants  among others include granting or permitting a security agreement against the consolidated assets of the companies other than permitted security agreements  declaring or paying any dividends or making any other payments on our capital stock  consolidating or merging with any other entity or acquiring or purchasing any equity interest in any other entity  or assuming any obligations of any other entity  except for notes and receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business  incurring  assuming  guarantying  or remaining liable with respect to any indebtedness  except for certain existing indebtedness disclosed in our financial statements  or undertaking any capital expenditure in excess of  in any one fiscal year 
the agreements also preclude changes in ownership in the companies  any material change in any of our business objectives  purposes  operations and tax residence or any other circumstances or events which will have a material adverse effect as defined by the agreements 
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of our operations  or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our debt 
at december   we were in violation of the covenant requiring a ratio of consolidated trade receivables to consolidated net borrowings of 
to although the bank of scotland has waived this default  there can be no assurance that defaults in these or other covenants will not occur in the future  nor can there be any assurance that our lender will waive future covenant violations 
management believes the company will be in compliance with its covenants in a default in the covenants would permit our lender to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and to sell the assets securing them  which would cause the company to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection 
on october   techdyne europe entered into a credit facility with bank of scotland for an amount of pound  
this facility comprises an eight year term loan repayable in quarterly payments of pound   in january  april  july and october of each year  with an interest rate of bank of scotland base rate plus effectively at december

the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allowances for inventory obsolescence  a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  actual results may differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in such financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
allowance for inventory obsolescence we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unusable in our manufacturing operations due to loss of a specific customer or a customer s product changes or discontinuations 
based on historical and projected sales information and our concentration of customers  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause our customers to cancel  reduce or reschedule orders 
these changes could affect our inventory turn over  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
income taxes deferred income taxes at the end of each period are determined by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future periods in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
long lived assets we state our property and equipment at acquisition cost and compute depreciation by the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
long lived assets are reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon delivery of a product based upon a customer s order where the selling price is fixed and our ability to collect is reasonably assured 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this report includes certain forward looking statements with respect to our company and its business that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are influenced by our financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and the plans and objectives of management for future operations 
they use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  project and other similar expressions 
although we believe our expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  we cannot assure you that our expectations will prove correct 
actual results and developments may differ materially from those conveyed in the forward looking statements 
for these statements  we claim the protections for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of important factors include changes in general economic  business and market conditions  as well as changes in such conditions that may affect industries or the markets in which we operate  including  in particular  the impact of our nation s current war on terrorism could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements made in this form report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities and interest bearing accounts at financial institutions in which we had approximately  invested at december  interest rate risks on debt are managed by negotiation of appropriate rates on new financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt agreements which totaled approximately  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments would have an insignificant impact on our results of operations 
a increase in rates on our year end variable rate debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our operations 
our exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates is minimal due to the closing of techdyne europe in may and our transfer of all techdyne europe operating assets to simclar in february
