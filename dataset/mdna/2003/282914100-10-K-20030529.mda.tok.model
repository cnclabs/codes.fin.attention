critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to litigation and other contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  the valuation of inventories  goodwill  income taxes  and financing operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under factors that may affect future results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
at the time of each revenue transaction we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are thirty to ninety days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to the company 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
for sales generated from long term contracts  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in doing so  management makes important judgments in costs and in measuring progress towards completion 
these judgments underlie our determinations regarding overall contract value  contract profitability and timing of revenue recognition 
revenue and cost estimates are revised quarterly based on changes in circumstances  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or when the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  revenue is recognized on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under factors that may affect future results 
collectibility of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march   and one customer represented of our gross accounts receivable 
based upon this customer s past payment history  discussions with the customer and our review of their financial condition  the outstanding balance was considered collectible and therefore no portion of this balance was specifically reserved for at march  valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill is included in our centile reporting unit  which is the same as our centile operating segment 
during our impairment assessment  we compare the carrying value of our centile reporting unit to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value 
the fair value for goodwill is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values  as appropriate 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to write off its remaining goodwill 
the impairment assessment resulted from our plan implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce the workforce of centile s france office by seventy percent 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
litigation management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation involving the company is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
at march   liabilities related to litigation matters were not significant 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability  if any  related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the years ended march    and  expressed as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
cost of product revenues is presented as a percentage of product revenues and cost of license and other revenues is presented as a percentage of license and other revenues 
you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

net loss revenues product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to a million decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales  offset by a  increase in voice over internet protocol voip semiconductor sales and a  increase in sales of videophones and media hub systems 
the significant decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor revenues was due primarily to a slight decrease in unit shipments  combined with decreases in average selling prices  or asps 
the decrease in unit shipments of our videoconferencing semiconductors as compared to the prior year  is primarily attributable to our announcement during fiscal of the end of life of our existing videoconferencing semiconductors  as well as the factors set forth below explaining the decline for fiscal versus fiscal our remaining videoconferencing semiconductor customers have been designing out our products in anticipation of the end of life 
the increase in voip semiconductor sales was attributable to a significant increase in unit shipments  offset by decreases in asps 
the increase in videophone system sales was attributable to our commencement of sales of these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as a result  fiscal includes four quarters of sales versus only one quarter of sales in fiscal the increase in media hub system revenues was attributable to the increase in licenses of our hosted ipbx product 
product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in product revenues in fiscal was due to decreases in sales of video monitoring and consumer videophone systems approximating million  resulting from our decision to terminate further development and sales of these product lines in prior years  a slight decrease in ip telephony semiconductor sales  a  decrease in media hub system revenues  and a million decrease in revenue derived from our videoconferencing semiconductor products 
the decrease in media hub system revenues as compared to the prior year period was due primarily to a decline in sales to a significant customer 
the significant decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor revenues was due primarily to a significant decrease in unit shipments  offset partially by increases in average selling prices  or asps 
factors that contributed to the significant decrease in unit shipments of our videoconferencing semiconductors as compared to the prior year include increased competition from other developers of semiconductors used in videoconferencing applications  the acquisition of two of our customers by a company that appears to have standardized its product development efforts around technology supplied by one or more of our competitors  increased competition from evolving pc based videoconferencing applications which has resulted in reduced demand for products marketed and sold by our customers that incorporate our videoconferencing semiconductors  and decreased corporate and consumer spending 
license and other revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million recorded in fiscal license and other revenues  the majority of which are considered to be non recurring in nature  consisted primarily of technology licenses and related maintenance revenues  as well as royalties earned under such licenses 
license and other revenues for both fiscal and included approximately million of non cash revenue recognition associated with the license of our video monitoring technology to interlogix in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in royalties earned by netergy under a license agreement for certain of our video compression technology 
royalty revenue recognized under this agreement totaled  for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal the licensee s obligations to pay royalties on shipments of products that incorporate our technology terminated in the first quarter of fiscal upon payment of the  a decrease of approximately million in revenues associated with our license of service creation environment sce technology to lucent and unified messaging technology to milinx  a million decrease in license revenue associated with our embedded ip telephony firmware technology  eg  veracity voip software and audacity t based reference design kits marketed by netergy  and a decrease of approximately million in non recurring license and maintenance revenues associated with netergy s videoconferencing technology 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in license and maintenance revenues associated with centile s hosted ipbx product  and approximately million of revenues recognized by netergy under a contract to develop our next generation video compression semiconductor product that is accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
profit estimates on this contract are revised periodically based on changes in facts  any loss is required to be recognized immediately 
based on our cost estimates as of march   we recognized a loss approximating  on this development contract in the quarter ended march   which has been recorded in the cost of license and other revenues line in the consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent changes in our cost estimates could require us to recognize additional losses in a future period as the revenues under this contract are fixed 
license revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million recognized in fiscal license and other revenues recognized in fiscal consisted primarily of technology licenses and related maintenance revenues  as well as royalties earned under such licenses 
license and other revenues for fiscal also included million of professional service revenues associated with our canadian operations 
no professional service revenues were recognized in fiscal due to the elimination of the professional services organization as part of the restructuring of our canadian operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal the negative impact of eliminating professional service revenues in fiscal was more than offset by the following an increase in royalties earned by netergy under a license agreement for certain of our video compression technology 
royalty revenue recognized under this agreement approximated million for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal  a million increase in license revenue associated with netergy s embedded ip telephony firmware technology  the recognition of  of previously deferred revenue associated with our license of unified messaging technology to milinx 
also  license revenues in fiscal included  of non recurring revenue associated with the license of our sce technology to lucent  a million increase in revenue in fiscal associated with the license of our video monitoring technology to interlogix in fiscal recognition of the approximately million of revenue ascribed to the license of video monitoring technology to interlogix had been deferred until we satisfied certain remaining obligations in the quarter ended march  revenue associated with the license is being recognized ratably over the license term  which expires in may all cash receipts associated with this license were received in fiscal  and a decrease of approximately  in non recurring license and maintenance revenues associated with netergy s videoconferencing technology 
revenues from our ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march    and accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
two customers represented more than of our total revenues in fiscal these customers  ge interlogix  inc and leadtek research  inc represented and of our total revenues  respectively 
three customers represented more than of our total revenues in fiscal these customers  ess technology  inc  leadtek research  inc and ge interlogix  inc 
represented  and of our total revenues  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march  no customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states represented   and  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands year ended march  united states    europe    taiwan    japan   other    cost of revenues and gross profit the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with system manufacturing  components  semiconductor wafer fabrication  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  and direct and indirect costs associated with purchasing  scheduling  and quality assurance 
gross profit from product revenues was million  million  and million  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
product gross margin was   and for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the  decrease in gross profit from product revenues was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues primarily attributable to lower asps  and a charge of approximately  for non cancelable purchase orders for ip telephony semiconductors recorded in the quarter ended march  the decreases in gross profit were partially mitigated by lower costs for our ip telephony semiconductors resulting from a change in suppliers during fiscal the million decrease in gross profit from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to a significant decrease in sales of our videoconferencing semiconductors and video monitoring systems 
gross profit in fiscal was also impacted by a decrease in product gross margins due to lower average selling prices realized on sales of our ip telephony semiconductors  and to a lessor extent  an increase in inventory reserves associated with our media hub products in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in margins was mitigated to some extent by an increase in average selling prices realized on the sale of our videoconferencing semiconductors and the reversal of  of reserves associated with our semiconductor products in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the sale of inventory that had been specifically reserved for in fiscal gross profit from license and other revenues  which were largely nonrecurring  was million  million  and million  in fiscal   and  respectively 
associated gross margins were   and in fiscal   and the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the reduction in license and other revenues  and costs incurred to perform development services under revenue generating contracts in fiscal  which included a loss approximating  in the quarter ended march  the significant increase in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to the elimination of our professional service organization as part of the restructuring of our canadian operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix  product pricing  the percentage of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
the markets for our products are characterized by falling average selling prices 
average selling prices realized to date for our ip telephony semiconductors have been lower than those historically attained for our videoconferencing semiconductor products  resulting in lower gross margins 
we have encountered significant price competition in the markets for our products  and are at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
to respond to competitive pricing pressures  we will be required to introduce differentiated products and continue to reduce costs as a means of maintaining or improving our margins 
we may not be successful in our development efforts or product cost reduction measures and may face continued erosion of margins 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the following the shift in engineering resources from research and development functions to revenue generating contracts  these costs approximated million for fiscal and were included in cost of license and other revenue  lower compensation costs due to a reduction in research and development personnel as compared to the comparable prior year period  reduced purchases of software and related maintenance contracts  reduced consulting expenses related to our sce technology  lower depreciation expense due to the retirement of assets  and our overall efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs 
the million decrease in research and development expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the following the elimination of our canadian operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development expenses incurred by our canadian operations in fiscal approximated million  reductions in research and development personnel staffing levels in the first and second quarters of fiscal  lower tooling and other project related expenses associated with semiconductor and system level reference design projects in fiscal  lower third party consulting expenses associated with development of the graphical user interface for centile s hosted ipbx product  a decrease in stock compensation charges of approximately  and our overall efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources  and general management 
such costs also include advertising  sales commissions  trade show  and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the following reductions in sales  marketing and administrative personnel staffing levels  and lower legal  financial reporting  corporate function  telephone  travel  corporate marketing  public relations and trade show expenditures resulting from our efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs 
the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the reasons set forth above  as well as a million decrease due to the elimination of our canadian operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and a  decrease in stock compensation expense 
in process research and development and amortization of intangibles we incurred in process research and development charges of million in the second quarter of fiscal related to the acquisition of u force  inc u force 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of u force  inc on june  for a total purchase price of million 
u force  based in montreal  canada  was a developer of ip based software applications and a provider of professional services 
u force was also developing a java based service creation environment sce designed to allow telecommunication service providers to develop  deploy  and manage telephony applications and services to their customers 
the purchase price was comprised of x common stock with a fair value of approximately million comprised of i  shares issued at closing of the acquisition  and ii  shares to be issued upon the exchange or redemption of the exchangeable shares the exchangeable shares of canadian entities held by former employee shareholders or indirect owners of u force stock 
the exchangeable shares held by u force employees were subject to certain restrictions  including our right to repurchase the exchangeable shares if an employee departed prior to vesting 
in addition  we also agreed to issue one share of preferred stock the special voting share that provides holders of exchangeable shares with voting rights equivalent to the shares of common stock into which their shares are convertible 
we also assumed outstanding stock options to purchase shares of u force common stock for which the black scholes pricing model value of approximately million was included in the purchase price 
direct transaction costs related to the merger were approximately  additionally  the company advanced million to u force upon signing the acquisition agreement  but prior to the close of the transaction 
this amount was accounted for as part of the purchase price 
the following table summarizes the composition of the purchase price in thousands value of common stock and exchangable shares issued  value of stock otions assumed  cash advanced to u force prior to closing  direct transaction costs the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the book value of u force s assets and liabilities  which we believe approximated their fair value 
intangible assets acquired included amounts allocated to u force s in process research and development 
the in process research and development related to u force s initial products  the sce and a unified messaging application  for which technological feasibility had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
the estimated percentage complete for the unified messaging and sce products was approximately and  respectively  at june  the fair value of the in process technology was based on a discounted cash flow model  similar to the traditional income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value  net of tax 
in developing cash flow projections  revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors  including estimated aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole  characteristics of the potential market for the technology  and the anticipated life of the technology 
projected annual revenues for the in process research and development projects were assumed to ramp up initially and decline significantly at the end of the in process technology s economic life 
operating expenses and resulting profit margins were forecasted based on the characteristics and cash flow generating potential of the acquired in process technologies 
risks that were considered as part of the analysis included the scope of the efforts necessary to achieve technological feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  and significant competitive threats from numerous companies 
we also considered the risk that if we failed to bring the products to market in a timely manner  it could adversely affect sales and profitability of the combined company in the future 
the resulting estimated net cash flows were discounted at a rate of 
this discount rate was based on the estimated cost of capital plus an additional discount for the increased risk associated with in process technology 
the value of the acquired u force in process research and development  which was expensed in the second quarter of fiscal  approximated million 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill 
amounts allocated to goodwill  the value of an assumed distribution agreement  and workforce were being amortized on a straight line basis over three  three  and two years  respectively 
the allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands in process research and development  distribution agreement  workforce  u force net tangible assets  goodwill  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets charged to operations was  and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
amortization expense included amounts related to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of u force in fiscal and odisei sa in fiscal beginning our fiscal year  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was adopted  and we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill  net of amortization  including intangibles related to the acquisition of odisei sa that were classified as goodwill upon the adoption of sfas no 
restructuring and other charges restructuring actions during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we continued our cost reduction activities to better align expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending during the current economic downturn 
as a result of these activities  we recorded restructuring and other asset impairment charges of approximately million 
these charges included severance and benefits of approximately million  as we reduced our workforce  under voluntary and involuntary separation plans  by thirty two employees or thirty percent 
the majority of the affected employees were netergy employees based in santa clara  california and marlow  united kingdom and included employees from sales and marketing and research and development  as well as four executives of netergy 
severance of approximately  attributable to involuntary terminations was paid during the year ended march  we closed netergy s facility in marlow  united kingdom  and recorded  of charges related to the termination of the operating leases for the facility and related services 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of  related to assets in the united kingdom that were abandoned or disposed of 
we also recorded a charge of approximately  for its remaining lease liability for office space in tempe  arizona that was vacated as a result of the restructuring actions during the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also implemented a plan to reduce the workforce at centile s sophia antipolis  france office by ten employees or seventy percent 
this downsizing and its potential impact on centile s ipbx business prompted an assessment of the key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation judgments 
as a result of the analysis  we determined that an impairment charge of million was required because the estimated fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value of the goodwill that arose from the acquisition of odisei sa in fiscal the following table illustrates the charges  credits and balances of the restructuring reserves as of march  and summarizes asset impairment charges in thousands total cash non cash liab ility at charges payments charges march restructuring charges severance   facility related total restructuring charges 
  asset impairments fixed assets goodwill   total impairment charges   total restructuring and impairment charges    we expect annual savings of approximately million related to voluntary and involuntary employee terminations 
future expected cost reductions will be reflected in the cost of sales  selling  general and administrative  and research and development line items in the consolidated statements of operations 
restructuring actions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  after a significant number of employees had resigned  we discontinued our canadian operations acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of u force in june we closed our offices in montreal and hull  quebec and laid off all remaining employees resulting in the cessation of the research and development efforts and the sales and marketing and professional services activities associated with the u force business 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a one time charge of million in the quarter ended march  the restructuring and other charges consisted of the following in thousands employee separation fixed asset losses and impairments  intangible asset impairments  lease obligation and termination employee separation costs represent severance payments related to the employees in the montreal and hull offices who were laid off 
the impairment charges for fixed assets of approximately million included write offs of abandoned and unusable assets of approximately million  a loss on sale of assets of  and a charge for assets to be disposed of  the loss on sale of assets of  was attributable to the sale of office  computer  and other equipment of the montreal facility 
we received common stock of the purchaser valued at approximately  as of the date of sale 
fair value of assets to be disposed of was measured based on expected salvage value  less costs to sell 
assets to be disposed of consist of computer equipment with a fair value of  at march  substantially all of these assets were liquidated during fiscal the impairment charges for intangible assets represented the write off of the unamortized intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of u force 
the charges of approximately million included million for the goodwill related to the acquisition   for the assembled workforce  and  related to a distribution agreement 
the impairments were directly attributable to the cessation of operations in canada 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the intangible assets related to these operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the lack of estimated future net cash flows related to the acquired products necessitated an impairment charge to write off the remaining unamortized goodwill 
the distribution agreement asset was written off because we will no longer provide products and services to customers under that agreement 
we terminated the lease for our primary facility in montreal in march  but we were required to pay rent on the facility through may  we terminated the lease for our facility in hull  quebec in fiscal accrued obligations related to remaining lease commitments on the montreal and hull facilities totaled  at march  payments made in fiscal related to the terminations of the montreal and hull facility leases totaled  cash payments related to the restructuring during the quarter ended march   which included all employee separation costs and certain lease termination costs  approximated  other income  net in fiscal   and  other income  net  was approximately  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to an approximately  decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates  a  non recurring gain realized on the sale of an investment in fiscal  and a  increase in foreign exchange losses 
these decreases were offset by an increase in other income from our former canadian operations of approximately  the increase in canadian other income was primarily attributable to the collection of canadian research and development and other tax credits in fiscal  which was partially offset by a write off of  which represented the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment generated from the translation of the financial statements of our canadian subsidiary 
our canadian subsidiary has been substantially liquidated 
we collected  of canadian tax credits in fiscal  but no further refundable tax credits are expected from canada 
apart from the tax credit receipt in fiscal and investment gain in described above  other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange gains and losses 
interest income has continued to decrease due to significantly lower average cash and cash equivalent balances combined with lower interest rates 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our exposure to currency risk 
the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a significant decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates 
gains realized on the sale of investments also decreased by approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense in each of the two years ended march  consisted mainly of charges associated with the convertible subordinated debentures  or the debentures  that we issued in december  including the amortization of the related debt discount and debt issuance costs 
we redeemed the debentures in december interest expense for the year ended march  also included approximately  associated with lease lines of credit and a bank loan assumed as part of the u force acquisition 
all of the u force debt obligations were repaid in the quarter ended march  provision for income taxes the provisions of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively  were comprised primarily of certain foreign taxes 
we had no provision for the fiscal year ended march  the provision for the year ended march  also reflected a  refund of us federal income taxes received in fiscal at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  the weight of objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and a full valuation allowance was recorded at march  and march  extraordinary gain we realized an extraordinary gain of  in the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated debentures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of this transaction 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in november  the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board reached several conclusions regarding the accounting for debt and equity securities with beneficial conversion features  including a consensus requiring the application of the accounting conversion price method  versus the use of the stated conversion price  to calculate the beneficial conversion feature for such securities 
the securities and exchange commission sec required companies to record a cumulative catch up adjustment in the fourth quarter of calendar related to the application of the accounting conversion price method to securities issued after may  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash expense during the quarter ended december  to account for a beneficial conversion feature associated with debentures and related warrants issued in december  and we presented it as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as required by the sec 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  representing a decrease of million from march  we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the net loss of million  a  decrease in accrued compensation  a million decrease in deferred revenue  and a  increase in accounts receivable 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a  decrease in inventory and non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of million  million for the non cash portion of restructuring and asset impairment charges  and  related to the provision for inventory 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was attributable to purchases of short term investments of  and capital expenditures of  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment of  cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of proceeds of  resulting from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of  a decrease in accrued compensation of  a decrease of  in other accrued liabilities  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a non cash extraordinary gain of  due to redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a  decrease in inventory  a million decrease in other current assets  and non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was attributable to proceeds from the sale of an investment in marketable equity securities of  and proceeds from the sale of equipment of  partially offset by capital expenditures of  cash used in financing activities during fiscal consisted of the million payment associated with the redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures and certain costs incurred in connection with the redemption  offset partially by proceeds of  resulting from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  decreases in accounts payable and accrued compensation of million and  an increase in other current and non current assets of million  and a non cash adjustment for a gain on sale of investments of  cash used in operations was partially offset by cash provided by a decrease in accounts receivable of  an increase in other accrued liabilities of  and non cash items  including restructuring charges of million  depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development of million  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  and stock compensation charges of  cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily attributable to net proceeds from the sale of assets and the license of technology associated with our video monitoring product line of million  offset by acquisitions of property and equipment of million and cash paid for acquisitions  net  of  cash flows from financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of the company s common stock totaling million  offset by debt repayments of  and repurchases of common stock and exchangeable shares of  for the year  cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
as of march   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under non cancelable operating leases 
at march   future minimum annual lease payments under noncancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  were as follows in thousands year ending march  total minimum payments as noted previously  we redeemed our convertible subordinated debentures in december the consideration included issuing  shares of our common stock to the lenders 
we have committed to maintaining the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the sec covering the resale of these shares 
should we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement we may be required to pay cash penalties and redeem all or a portion of the shares at the higher of or the market price of our common stock at the time of the redemption which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows 
the value of the shares still held by the lenders of  at march   based upon the per share minimum potential redemption price  is reflected as contingently redeemable common stock in the consolidated balance sheet 
the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report have been prepared assuming that x will continue as a going concern  and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
x has incurred recurring losses from operations  had recurring negative cash flows  and has a significant accumulated deficit 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we are currently seeking additional financing in order to meet our cash requirements for fiscal we may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including reductions of personnel  salaries and capital expenditures 
alternatively  or in addition to such potential measures  we may elect to implement other cost reduction actions as we may determine are necessary and in our best interests  including the possible sale or cessation of certain of our business segments 
any such actions undertaken might limit our opportunities to realize plans for revenue growth and we might not be able to reduce our costs in amounts sufficient to achieve break even or profitable operations 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
related party transactions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold million shares of its common stock to stmicroelectronics nv stm at a purchase price of per share and received net proceeds of million 
during fiscal  we purchased semiconductors from a subsidiary of stm 
such purchases approximated  in addition  during fiscal we contracted with a subsidiary of stm for non recurring engineering services related to the development of our new semiconductor product 
as of march   we had recorded liabilities to stm of  for semiconductor purchases and purchase commitments and engineering services 
in march the board authorized us to open securities trading accounts and make investments of up to million on behalf of x  inc as directed by our chairman  joe parkinson  chief executive officer  or chief financial officer 
mr 
parkinson has agreed to personally reimburse x on a quarterly basis for any losses resulting from his trading activities in order to maintain a minimum investment account balance of million 
the board has been assured of mr 
parkinson s ability to cover any such losses  however  should he be unable to do so it could have a material impact on our cash flows and results of operations 
as part of the arrangement  our board has expressed its intent  but not obligation  to pay mr 
parkinson a quarterly bonus in an amount equal to of the profits attributable to investments made on our behalf by mr 
parkinson to the extent such a bonus exceeds his salary for the corresponding period 
the company or mr 
parkinson can terminate this arrangement at any time  subject to the terms of an agreement between x and mr 
parkinson 
under the arrangement  we are required to return to mr 
parkinson the amount representing the increase in value of the investment account over million to the extent required to restore replenishment payments made by mr 
parkinson in prior quarters 
through march   mr 
parkinson had made cumulative replenishment payments of approximately  to offset losses incurred 
as of march   the investment account balance approximated  accordingly  we had a payable of approximately  to mr 
parkinson at march  as of march   approximately  of the million allocated for such investment activities was invested in marketable equity securities 
the remaining  was invested in money market funds 
recent accounting pronouncements on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
sfas no 
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale and requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that i can be distinguished from the rest of the entity  and ii will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
we adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supercedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that the liability be initially measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and its adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
fin requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
the provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have included additional disclosures in accordance with fin in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the additional disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
we have included additional disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report 
factors that may affect future results we will need to raise additional capital to support our operations  and failure to do so in a timely manner may cause us to implement additional cost reduction strategies as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the possibility that we will not be able to meet our obligations as and when they become due over the next twelve months raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
accordingly  we have been pursuing  and will continue to pursue  the implementation of certain cost reduction strategies 
additionally  we are seeking additional financing and evaluating financing alternatives in order to meet our cash requirements for fiscal we may not be able to obtain additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to further reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including additional reductions of personnel and capital expenditures 
alternatively  or in addition to such potential measures  we may elect to implement other cost reduction actions as we may determine are necessary and in our best interests  including the possible sale or cessation of certain of our business segments 
any such actions undertaken might limit our opportunities to realize plans for revenue growth and we might not be able to reduce our costs in amounts sufficient to achieve break even or profitable operations 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced and they may experience significant dilution 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we are not successful in these actions  we may be forced to cease operations 
we have a history of losses and we are uncertain as to our future profitability we recorded an operating loss of approximately million in the quarter ended march  and we ended the period with an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we recorded operating losses of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and such losses may be substantial 
we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve an operating profit 
given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market in april  we were notified by the nasdaq staff that the bid price for our common stock must close at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during the ninety calendar day period ending july  or we might be delisted 
as we were not in compliance under the nasdaq national market minimum bid price listing standard by july   we transferred to and began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market on july  as a result of our transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market  our delisting determination was extended an additional ninety days until october  although our common stock did not achieve a closing bid price of for at least ten consecutive trading days before october   we met the initial listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market as of october  as a result  we remained eligible to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market for an additional calendar day grace period  which expired on april   subject to our compliance with the continued listing requirements during the extended grace period 
on april   the nasdaq staff notified us that we have been granted an additional ninety days  or until july  to regain compliance with the minimum bid price listing standard 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain the continued listing requirements  and  as a result  may be delisted from trading on that system 
delisting could reduce the ability of our shareholders to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
for instance  failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange may make it more difficult for traders to sell our securities 
broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our common stock 
not maintaining a listing on a major stock market may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  lessen interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our common stock  make it more difficult to obtain analyst coverage  and make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
our stock price has been highly volatile the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
it may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  loss of key personnel  new products or new contracts by us  our competitors or their customers  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general market conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and other factors which could be unrelated to  or outside our control  and the potential delisting of our common stock 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against the issuing company 
if our stock price is volatile  we may also be subject to such litigation 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would disrupt business and could cause a decline in our operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
if we fail to maintain effectiveness of a registration statement for the resale of shares of our common stock issued in connection with the redemption of our previously outstanding convertible debt  we may be forced to pay a cash penalty or redeem all or a portion of the shares  causing our business to suffer under the terms of a registration rights agreement we entered into in connection with the redemption of our outstanding convertible debt  we agreed to register the  shares of our common stock issued to the former note holders for resale 
if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement  we may be required to pay cash penalties and may be required to redeem all or a portion of the shares of common stock held by the former note holders 
under the agreement  the redemption price would be the higher of or the market price of our common stock at the time of the redemption 
if we are required to pay a cash penalty or to redeem any of the shares  this will deplete our cash reserves  which may cause significant harm to our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the growth of our business and future profitability depends on future ip telephony revenue we believe that our business and future profitability will be largely dependent on widespread market acceptance of our ip telephony technology and products 
our videoconferencing semiconductor business has not provided sufficient revenues to profitably operate our business  and we have announced the end of life of these products and expect to make our final shipments in the first quarter of fiscal to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the sale of our ip telephony products and services 
if we are not able to generate significant revenues selling into the ip telephony market  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
success of our ip telephony strategy assumes that there will be future demand for ip telephony systems and services 
in order for the ip telephony market to continue to grow  several things need to occur 
telephone service providers must continue to invest in the deployment of high speed broadband networks to residential and commercial customers 
ip networks must improve quality of service for real time communications  managing effects such as packet jitter  packet loss  and unreliable bandwidth  so that toll quality service can be provided 
ip telephony equipment must achieve the reliability that users of the public switched telephone network have come to expect from their telephone service 
ip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our business may not grow 
our business has been adversely affected by the downturn in the telecommunications industry and these developments will continue to impact our revenues and operating results through the end of  the telecommunications market was experiencing rapid growth spurred by a number of factors including deregulation in the industry  entry of a large number of new emerging service providers  growth in data traffic and the availability of significant capital from the financial markets 
in  the telecommunications industry began a reversal of some of these trends  marked by a dramatic reduction in current and projected future capital expenditures by service providers  financial difficulties and  in some cases  bankruptcies experienced by emerging service providers  as well as a sharp contraction in the availability of capital 
these conditions caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment and related software  which has had a resulting impact on demand for netergy s ip telephony semiconductor and software products and for centile s hosted ipbx solution 
if our current or potential customers are forced to defer or further curtail their capital spending programs  sales of our hosted ipbx product and packet ip telephone service to telecommunication service providers and sales of our ip telephony semiconductors to manufacturers of telecommunication equipment may continue to be adversely affected  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  many of the industries in which telecommunication service providers operate have experienced consolidation 
the loss of one or more of our current or potential telecommunication service provider or telecommunication equipment oem customers  through industry consolidation or otherwise  could reduce or eliminate our sales to such a customer and consequently harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we expect the developments described above to continue to affect our business for at least the next several quarters in the following manner our ability to accurately forecast revenue will be diminished  our revenues could be reduced  and our losses may increase because operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed in the short term 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any one or a combination of the above 
our future operating results may not follow past or expected trends due to many factors and any of these could cause our stock price to fall our historical operating results have fluctuated significantly and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future  and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall 
on an annual and a quarterly basis  there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results  many of which are outside our control 
these include  but are not limited to changes in market demand  the timing of customer orders  competitive market conditions  lengthy sales cycles and or regulatory approval cycles  new product introductions by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  the management of inventory  the level of international sales  continued compliance with industry standards  and general economic conditions 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix  the recognition of license and other revenues for which there may be little or no corresponding cost of revenues  product pricing  the allocation between international and domestic sales  the percentages of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
the markets for our products are characterized by falling average selling prices 
we expect that  as a result of competitive pressures  our product end of life announcement  and other factors  gross profit as a percentage of revenue for our videoconferencing semiconductor products will continue to decrease 
average selling prices realized to date for our ip telephony semiconductors have been lower than those historically attained for our videoconferencing semiconductor products  resulting in lower gross margins 
in the likely event that we encounter significant price competition in the markets for our products  we could be at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
variations in timing of sales may cause significant fluctuations in future operating results 
because a significant portion of our business may be derived from orders placed by a limited number of large customers  including original equipment manufacturers  the timing of such orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results 
anticipated orders from customers may fail to materialize 
delivery schedules may be deferred or canceled for a number of reasons  including changes in specific customer requirements or economic conditions 
the adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products  which would also have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  it is likely that in some or all future periods our operating results will be below the expectations of investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock 
we depend on purchase orders from key customers and failure to receive significant purchase orders in the future would cause a decline in our operating results historically  a significant portion of our sales has been to relatively few customers  although the composition of these customers has varied 
revenues from our ten largest customers for the fiscal years ended march   and  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues 
substantially all of our product sales have been made  and are expected to continue to be made  on a purchase order basis 
none of our customers has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products 
in the future  we will need to gain purchase orders for our products to earn additional revenue 
further  substantially all of our license and other revenues are nonrecurring 
the ip telephony market is subject to rapid technological change and we depend on new product introduction in order to maintain and grow our business ip telephony is an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent introductions of new and enhanced products  and continuing and rapid technological advancement 
to compete successfully in this emerging market  we must continue to design  develop  manufacture  and sell new and enhanced semiconductor and ip telephony software products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost 
these new and enhanced products must take advantage of technological advancements and changes  and respond to new customer requirements 
our success in designing  developing  manufacturing  and selling such products and services will depend on a variety of factors  including the identification of market demand for new products  the scalability of our ip telephony software products  product and feature selection  timely implementation of product design and development  product performance  cost effectiveness of products under development  effective manufacturing processes  and success of promotional efforts 
additionally  we may also be required to collaborate with third parties to develop our products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays will likely occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  if such new or enhanced products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  or if such new product introductions decrease demand for existing products  our operating results would decline and our business would not grow 
the long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our ip telephony products may cause our revenue and operating results to vary our ip telephony software and semiconductor products  including our hosted ipbx  packet telephone service and our audacity family of semiconductors  have lengthy sales cycles  and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort without making a sale 
a customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy product evaluation and qualification process 
we do not possess the capital infrastructure required to invest in extensive marketing or advertising campaigns that may be required in order to sell these products 
in addition  the length of our sales cycles will vary depending on the type of customer to whom we are selling and the product being sold 
even after making the decision to purchase our products  our customers may deploy our products slowly 
timing of deployment can vary widely and will depend on various factors  including the size of the network deployment  the complexity of our customers network environments  our customers skill sets  the hardware and software configuration and customization necessary to deploy our products  and our customers ability to finance their purchase of our products 
as a result  it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which our customers may purchase our ip telephony products  and our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we need to retain key personnel to support our products and ongoing operations the development and marketing of our ip telephony products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel  management  and other resources 
while the pace of economic growth in the san francisco bay area where our corporate headquarters are located has slowed  competition for highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing  and support personnel has remained strong 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
none of our officers or key employees are bound by employment agreements for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or key employees could delay the development and introduction of  and negatively impact our ability to sell our products which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture substantially all of our products  and any delay or interruption in manufacturing by these contract manufacturers would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business we outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductor products to independent foundries and as such do not have internal manufacturing capabilities to meet our customers demands 
we have shifted the manufacture of our voice over ip semiconductors to an affiliate of stmicroelectronics nv  or stm  from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc 
stm or its contract manufacturer  tsmc  will be the sole manufacturer of our semiconductor products 
furthermore  to the extent tsmc is utilized  taiwan is always subject to geological or geopolitical disturbances that could instantly cut off such supply 
we also rely on other third party manufacturers for packaging and testing of our semiconductors 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers or our component suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our subcontract manufacturers will be able or willing to reliably manufacture our products  in volumes  on a cost effective basis or in a timely manner 
for our semiconductor products  the time to port our technology to another foundry  the time to qualify the new versions of product  and the cost of this effort as well as the tooling associated with wafer production would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
for our consumer videophones  ip telephones and media hub devices that are used with our hosted ipbx and packet voice and video ip telephone service  we rely on the availability of these semiconductor products 
these devices are also sourced solely from certain overseas contract manufacturers and partners  and are not available from any other manufacturer 
we may not be able to manage our inventory levels effectively  which may lead to inventory obsolescence that would force us to lower our prices our products have lead times of up to several months  and are built to forecasts that are necessarily imprecise 
because of our practice of building our products to necessarily imprecise forecasts  it is likely that  from time to time  we will have either excess or insufficient product inventory 
excess inventory levels would subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence and the risk that our selling prices may drop below our inventory costs  while insufficient levels of inventory may negatively affect relations with customers 
for instance  our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates  and any disruption in the supply of our products could result in legal action from our customers  loss of customers or harm to our ability to attract new customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  orders for our products will be delayed or canceled and substantial product returns could occur  which could harm our business many of the potential customers for our hosted ipbx product and packet voice and video ip telephone service have requested that our products and services be designed to interoperate with their existing networks  each of which may have different specifications and use multiple standards 
our customers networks may contain multiple generations of products from different vendors that have been added over time as their networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with these products as well as with future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our product designs to achieve a sale  which may result in a longer sales cycle  increased research and development expense  and reduced operating margins 
if our products do not interoperate with existing equipment or software in our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be canceled or our products could be returned 
this could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our packet telephone service depends on the availability of third party network service providers that provide telephone numbers and pstn call termination and origination services for our customers 
many of these network service providers are financially affected by the downturn in the telecommunications industry and may be forced to terminate the services that we depend on 
the time to interface our technology to another network service provider  if available  and qualify this new service could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may have difficulty identifying the source of the problem when there is a problem in a network our hosted ipbx and packet ip telephone service must successfully integrate with products from other vendors  such as gateways to traditional telephone systems 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our hosted ipbx solution  packet service or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
in addition  our focus on developing a range of technology products  including semiconductors and related embedded software  hosted ipbx solutions  and the packet telephone service products  places a significant strain on our research and development resources 
competitors that focus on one aspect of technology  such as software or semiconductors  may have a considerable advantage over us 
in addition  many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  technical  and other resources 
for example  certain competitors in the market for our semiconductor products maintain their own semiconductor foundries and may therefore benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
many also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of products than we have 
competition in our markets may result in significant price reductions 
as a result of their greater resources  many current and potential competitors may be better able than us to initiate and withstand significant price competition or downturns in the economy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively  and any failure to do so would harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if we do not develop and maintain successful partnerships for ip telephony products  we may not be able to successfully market our solutions we are entering into new market areas and our success is partly dependent on our ability to forge new marketing and engineering partnerships 
ip telephony communication systems are extremely complex and few  if any  companies possess all the required technology components needed to build a complete end to end solution 
we will likely need to enter into partnerships to augment our development programs and to assist us in marketing complete solutions to our targeted customers 
we may not be able to develop such partnerships in the course of our product development 
even if we do establish the necessary partnerships  we may not be able to adequately capitalize on these partnerships to aid in the success of our business 
inability to protect our proprietary technology or our infringement of a third party s proprietary technology would disrupt our business we rely in part on trademark  copyright  and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and abroad 
we seek to protect our software  documentation  and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law  which afford only limited protection 
we also rely in part on patent law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we hold fifty four united states patents and have a number of united states and foreign patent applications pending 
we cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the united states or internationally where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited  and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours 
we have in the past licensed and in the future expect to continue licensing our technology to others  many of who are located or may be located abroad 
there are no assurances that such licensees will protect our technology from misappropriation 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
there has been substantial litigation in the semiconductor  electronics  and related industries regarding intellectual property rights  and from time to time third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
our broad range of technology  including systems  digital and analog circuits  software  and semiconductors  increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material 
we could also be required to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against the company 
we rely upon certain technology  including hardware and software  licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  and could harm our business 
these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses 
the cost and terms of these licenses individually are not material to our business 
the failure of ip networks to meet the reliability and quality standards required for voice and video communications could render our products obsolete circuit switched telephony networks feature very high reliability  with a guaranteed quality of service 
in addition  such networks have imperceptible delay and consistently satisfactory audio quality 
emerging broadband ip networks  such as lans  wans  and the internet  or emerging last mile technologies such as cable  digital subscriber lines  and wireless local loop  may not be suitable for telephony unless such networks and technologies can provide reliability and quality consistent with these standards 
our products must comply with industry standards  fcc regulations  state  country specific and international regulations  and changes may require us to modify existing products in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of telephony over broadband ip networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
our ip telephony products rely heavily on standards such as sip  h  mgcp and megaco to interoperate with other vendors equipment 
there is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application  and about the definition of the standards themselves 
these standards  as well as audio and video compression standards  continue to evolve 
we also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving industry standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our ip telephony products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future legislation or regulation of the internet and or voice and video over ip services could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business at present there are few laws  regulations or rulings that specifically address access to or commerce on the internet  including ip telephony 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that future legislation  legal decisions or regulations concerning the internet may have on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regulation may be targeted towards  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing taxes related to internet communications  imposing tariffs or regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services  imposing regulations and requirements related to the handling of emergency services  any of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing growth of the broadband ip telephony market and popularity of broadband ip telephony products and services heighten the risk that governments or other legislative bodies will seek to regulate broadband ip telephony and the internet 
in addition  large  established telecommunication companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of the broadband ip telephony market  which may be contrary to our interests 
recent federal legislation provides for a significant deregulation of the us telecommunications industry  including the local exchange  long distance and cable television industries 
this legislation remains subject to judicial review and additional federal communications commission  or fcc  rulemaking 
as a result  we cannot predict the legislation s effect on our future operations 
many regulatory actions are under way or are being contemplated by federal and state authorities regarding important items 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
potential regulation of internet service providers could adversely affect our operations to date  the fcc has treated internet service providers as data service providers 
data service providers are currently exempt from federal and state regulations governing common carriers  including the obligation to pay access charges and contribute to the universal service fund 
the fcc is currently examining the status of internet service providers and the services they provide 
if the fcc were to determine that internet service providers  or the services they provide  are subject to fcc regulation  including the payment of access charges and contribution to the universal service funds  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the company may lose customers if it experiences system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services that it provides the operation of our packet voice and video service depends on our ability to avoid and mitigate any interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers 
interruptions in service or performance problems  for whatever reason  could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones 
in addition  because our services may be critical to the businesses of our customers  any significant interruption in service could result in lost profits or other loss to our customers 
although we attempt to disclaim liability in our service agreements  a court might not enforce a limitation on liability  which could expose us to financial loss 
in addition  we may provide our customers with guaranteed service level commitments 
if we are unable to meet these guaranteed service level commitments as a result of service interruptions  we may be obligated to provide credits  generally in the form of free service for a short period of time  to our customers  which could negatively affect our operating results 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our network  or those of our partners or customers  could result in the interruption of customer service until necessary repairs are made or replacement equipment is installed 
network failures  delays and errors could also result from natural disasters  terrorist acts  power losses  security breaches and computer viruses 
these failures  faults or errors could cause delays  service interruptions  expose us to customer liability or require expensive modifications that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide ip voice and video services while we do not know of any technologies that are patented by others that we believe are necessary for us to provide our services  this necessary technology may in fact be patented by other parties either now or in the future 
if this technology were held under patent by another person  we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that technology 
we may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable 
the existence of such a patent  or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms  could force us to cease using the technology and offering products and services incorporating the technology 
we may transition to smaller geometry process technologies and higher levels of design integration  which could disrupt our business we continuously evaluate the benefits  on an integrated circuit  product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to reduce costs related to the development and production of our semiconductors or to improve their performance 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important for us to remain competitive 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes which has resulted and could continue to result in reduced yields  delays in product deliveries  and increased expense levels 
moreover  we are dependent on relationships with our foundry and their partners to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented  we may experience delays in product introductions and incur increased expenses 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
we cannot predict whether higher levels of design integration or the use of third party intellectual property will adversely affect our ability to deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
if we discover product defects  we may have product related liabilities which may cause us to lose revenues or delay market acceptance of our products products as complex as those we offer frequently contain errors  defects  and functional limitations when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors  defects or functional limitations 
we sell products into markets that are extremely demanding of robust  reliable  fully functional products 
therefore  delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our credibility with our customers and adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors  defects or functional limitations could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by us 
despite our testing  our suppliers or our customers may find errors  defects or functional limitations in new products after commencement of commercial production 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we have significant international operations  which subject us to risks that could cause our operating results to decline sales to customers outside of the united states during the years ended march   and were  and of total revenues  respectively 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the corresponding period 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands year ended march  united states    europe    taiwan    japan   other    substantially all of our current semiconductor and system level products are  and substantially all of our future products will be  manufactured  assembled  and tested by independent third parties in foreign countries 
international sales and manufacturing are subject to a number of risks  including general economic conditions in regions such as asia  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunication standards  export license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  potentially adverse tax consequences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  the impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  and difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations 
we are also subject to geopolitical risks  such as political  social  and economic instability  potential hostilities  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with our international operations 
taiwan in particular is subject to a high rate of natural disasters  such as earthquakes or typhoons  which could have significant impact on our suppliers and customers due to a delay in operations within that country 
in addition  taiwan s tenuous relationship with mainland china is a source of continuing concern due to potential hostilities 
a significant decline in demand from foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the location of our headquarters facility subjects us to the risk of earthquakes our corporate headquarters is located in the san francisco bay area of northern california  a region known for seismic activity 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may face interruption of production and services due to increased security measures in response to recent and potential future terrorist activities our business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
recently  in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in transportation  mail  financial or other services  particularly any such delays or stoppages which harm our ability to obtain an adequate supply of products from our independent suppliers  could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  we may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the terrorist activities and potential activities 
we may also experience delays in receiving payments from customers that have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the united states economy in general is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities 
any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations  impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
moreover  we cannot determine whether other attacks may occur in the future and the effects of such attacks on our business 
these risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in forward looking statements the reports that we file with the sec and our other communications may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we consider forward looking statements to be those statements that describe intentions  beliefs  and current expectations with respect to future operating performance 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of certain factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in europe and asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  the vast majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  almost all of our arrangements with our semiconductor and system vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have foreign subsidiaries and are exposed to market risk from changes in exchange rates 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we invest the majority of our surplus cash and cash equivalents in money market funds that bear variable interest rates  and  accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates do not have an impact on the fair values of such investments 
however  given the currently low yields on such money market funds and other low risk governmental and corporate debt securities  in march the company s board of directors authorized us to open securities trading accounts and make investments in other classes of securities that may generate higher returns 
the amount allocated for such investments was million to be invested on behalf of x  inc at the direction of the company s chairman  joe parkinson  chief executive officer  or chief financial officer 
mr 
parkinson has agreed to personally reimburse x on a quarterly basis for any losses resulting from his trading activities in order to maintain a minimum investment account balance of million 
the board has been assured of mr 
parkinson s ability to cover any such losses  however  should he be unable to do so  it could have a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations  and financial condition 
as part of the arrangement  our board of directors has expressed its intent  but not obligation  to pay mr 
parkinson a quarterly bonus in an amount equal to of the profits attributable to investments made on our behalf by mr 
parkinson to the extent such a bonus exceeds his salary for the corresponding period 
the company or mr 
parkinson can terminate this arrangement at any time  subject to the terms of an agreement that was filed with our fiscal report 
as of march   approximately  of the million was invested in money market funds
