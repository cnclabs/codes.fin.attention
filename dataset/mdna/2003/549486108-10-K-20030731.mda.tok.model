item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s low moisture mozzarella cheese  which accounts for more than a majority of the company s sales  is a commodity item 
the company prices this product competitively with others in the industry  which pricing  is based on the chicago mercantile exchange block cheddar market cme block market 
the price the company pays for fluid milk and condensed skim milk solids  a significant component of cost of goods sold  is not determined until the month after its cheese has been sold 
the price of milk is based upon the raw milk components and a weighted average of a number of market components 
while the company generally can anticipate a change in the price of milk because of changes in the cme block market  it cannot anticipate the full extent thereof 
therefore  if the cme block cheddar price to which our selling price is referenced changes at a different rate than the price of milk our margins are affected accordingly 
by virtue of the pricing structure in the industry the company cannot readily pass along to the customer the changes in the cost of milk 
as a consequence thereof  the company s gross profit margin for its products is subject to fluctuation  which fluctuation  however slight  can have a significant effect on profitability 
the company is unable to predict any future increase or decrease in the prices in the cme block market as such market is subject to fluctuation based on factors and commodity markets outside of the control of the company 
although the cost of fluid milk does tend to move correspondingly with the cme block market  the extent of such movement and the timing thereof is not predictable 
as a result of these factors  the company is unable to predict pricing trends

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
revenue is recognized when goods are shipped from production facilities or outside warehouses to customers 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate to cover potential uncollectible accounts 
changes in general  economic  business and market conditions could result in an impairment in the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated based on actual collections 
allowance for inventory obsolescence we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming not saleable due to spoilage or changes in customers requirements 
based on historical and projected sales information  we believe that our allowance is adequately stated 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause our customers purchasing requirements to change 
these changes could affect the sales of our inventory  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed regularly and changes to the allowance are made as new information is received 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because there is a strong likelihood that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
however  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowance and record a deferred tax asset for an amount that has a strong likelihood to be realized 
impact of inflation inflationary factor have not had a significant effect on our operations
