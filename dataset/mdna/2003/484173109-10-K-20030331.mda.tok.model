critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal to our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to impairment of property and equipment and environmental costs 
the carrying value of kpp s property and equipment is periodically evaluated using management s estimates of undiscounted future cash flows  or  in some cases  third party appraisals  as the basis of determining if impairment exists under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or the disposal of long lived assets  which was adopted effective january  to the extent that impairment is indicated to exist  an impairment loss is recognized by kpp under sfas no 
based on fair value 
the application of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the results of operations of kpp for the year ended december  however  future evaluations of carrying value are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of kpp s control  including demand for refined petroleum products and terminaling services in kpp s market areas  and local  state and federal governmental regulations 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments might occur  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of kpp 
kpp environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations  and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded by kpp when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or kpp s commitment to a formal plan of action 
the application of kpp s environmental accounting policies did not have a material impact on the results of operations of kpp for the years ended december    or although kpp believes that its operations are in general compliance with applicable environmental regulations  risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline and terminaling operations 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and legal claims for damages to property or persons resulting from the operations of kpp could result in substantial costs and liabilities  any of which could have a material effect on the results of operations of kpp

the company is currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
 which must be adopted in the first quarter of in april of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which  among other items  affects the income statement classification of gains and losses from early extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 early extinguishment of debt is considered a risk management strategy  with resulting gains and losses no longer classified as an extraordinary item  unless the debt extinguishment meets certain unusual in nature and infrequency of occurrence criteria  which is expected to be rare 
effective october   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and has reclassified all previously reported extraordinary losses on debt extinguishment  before minority interest and income taxes  to loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of income 
in july of  the fasb issued sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements of guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and  and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  and have been adopted

 which amends sfas no

the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  management of the company believes that the application of this interpretation will have no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on the company s and kpp s debt and investment portfolios 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents  accordingly  the carrying amounts approximate fair value 
the company s investments are not material to its financial position or performance 
assuming variable rate debt of million including kpp s debt at december   a one percent increase in interest rates would increase annual net interest expense and decrease interest of outside non controlling partners in kpp s net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
information regarding kpop s september interest rate hedging transaction is included in item interest and other income 
the product market business periodically purchases refined petroleum products for sales to commercial interests  for resale as bunker fuel and to maintain an inventory of blendstocks for customers 
such petroleum inventories are generally held for short periods of time  not exceeding days 
as the company does not engage in derivative transactions to hedge the value of the inventory  it is subject to market risk from changes in global oil markets 
increases or decreases in the market value of inventory  which were not significant in  are reflected in the product marketing services cost of the products sold
