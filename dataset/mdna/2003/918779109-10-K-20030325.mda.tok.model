it is intended to assist readers in evaluating vail banks performance 
certain reclassifications have been made to previous periods information to conform to the presentation 
the following analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as well as the selected financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
corporate profile vail banks is a bank holding company headquartered in vail  colorado with assets of million at december  vail banks wholly owned subsidiary  weststar bank weststar  is a colorado state bank with retail offices as of february   located primarily in the western slope region of colorado

for further information  see notes to consolidated financial statements note contained in item of this annual report on form k 
mergers mergers and acquisitions continue to be part of vail banks overall growth strategy 
all mergers have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the purchase price of each transaction has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of the merger 
the consolidated financial statements include the operations of each of the acquired entities since the date of the respective transactions 
the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill  which is included in intangible assets  and was being amortized over years 
as of january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides new guidance on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets 
specifically  all new and pre existing goodwill is no longer being amortized  but instead is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
see pro forma operating results for further information 
first western mortgage services  inc first western 
on january   weststar acquired first western for consideration of million that included cash and installment notes 
the acquisition added mortgage brokerage services to weststar s lending services 
estes bank corporation united valley 
on july   vail banks completed the united valley merger by issuing  shares of vail banks common stock valued at million and million in cash 
as of the merger date  united valley had assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
see item  financial statements note for pro forma results of operations as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of other transactions 
on december   vail banks acquired assets from east west mortgage company east west for consideration that included cash of  and  shares of vail banks common stock 
see item business general for further information on these transactions and the mergers described above 
financial overview net income for decreased  or  to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the net interest margin from for to for  which was partially offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization expense with the implementation of sfas no 
see above 
net income for increased million  or  to million from million in the company took charges during of   net of tax  including the write off of certain correspondent bank account transactions  start up expenses associated with the opening of its aspen office  conversion expenses for the merger with united valley  and employee related costs for the restructuring of its management group 
the return on average assets was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the return on average equity was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  assets decreased by million  or less than  to million during this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net loans of million offset by an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million and an increase in loans held for sale generated by first western of million 
in  assets decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net loans of million offset by an increase in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million and an increase in loans held for sale generated by first western of million 
the decrease in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis fte net interest income of to million in from million in was primarily due to the multiple interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve throughout and in november  as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in fte net interest income of to million in from million in was primarily from growth in net average earning assets average earning assets less average interest bearing liabilities 
net average earning assets were million in  up from million in pro forma operating results during june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after an acquisition has been completed 
specifically  all new and pre existing goodwill will no longer be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
amortization of other intangible assets will continue 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and determined that the net unamortized goodwill of million was not impaired as of that date 
additionally  the company reassessed the useful life of the core deposit intangible asset related to a previously acquired branch 
the company determined that as of january   the core deposit intangible asset had a remaining useful life of twelve years 
accordingly  the  unamortized balance as of january  will be amortized to expense on a straight line basis over twelve years 
this reduction in remaining life resulted in additional core deposit intangible amortization expense of   after tax for the year ended december  over the comparable periods during and in addition to the transitional impairment test required as of january   sfas requires that an annual impairment test be performed 
the company performed this annual impairment test during the third quarter of and determined that the goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
the following table presents comparative net income and earnings per share information as if goodwill amortization expense had not been recorded for and  and as if the remaining useful life of the core deposit intangible asset had been revised as of january  in thousands  except share data net income reported net income    add back goodwill amortization   less additional core deposit intangible amortization less income taxes adjusted net income    basic earnings per share reported basic earnings per share add back effect of goodwill amortization less effect of additional core deposit intangible amortization less income taxes adjusted basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported diluted earnings per share add back effect of goodwill amortization less effect of additional core deposit intangible amortization less income taxes adjusted diluted earnings per share results of operations net interest income net interest income continues to be vail banks principal source of income  representing the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in this discussion  fte net interest income includes tax exempt income  such as interest on securities of states and municipalities  increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
this adjustment places taxable and nontaxable income on a common basis and permits comparisons of rates and yields

fte margin has been computed by dividing fte net interest income by total earning assets 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest yields and rates on these assets and liabilities 
an analysis of how changes in volume and yields and rates affected net interest income for the years ended december   and is presented below

notes the change in interest that cannot be attributed to only a change in rate or a change in volume  but instead represents a combination of the two factors  has been allocated to the rate variance 
net interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis fte  decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the net interest margin on an fte basis was for as compared to for net interest margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity as well as the cost of interest bearing liabilities as compared to the yield on earnings assets 
the decrease in net interest margin during was primarily due to the multiple interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve throughout and in november as well as a shift in the mix of earning assets from loans to investments and federal funds sold  and in interest bearing liabilities from deposits to borrowings 
during  vail banks experienced increased liquidity as the result of a decrease in loan demand attributable to the soft economy and more conservative underwriting policies 
in response  the company completed a short term leverage strategy that enabled it to add income by borrowing from the federal home loan bank fhlb and reinvesting those funds primarily in mortgage backed securities  resulting in a net spread 
although this strategy was designed to add net income  it did  however  have a somewhat negative impact on the net interest margin due to the smaller spread between rates offered on investments and charged on borrowings than would have been generated from the spread between loan and deposit rates 
interest income fte decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that earning assets increased million or during the same period 
during  the mix of earning assets shifted away from loans and more toward investment securities and federal funds sold 
loans had a yield of during as compared to the yield on investment securities and yield on federal funds sold 
however  during  average loans declined to of earning assets as compared to during as a result of this shift  the total yield on average earnings assets decreased basis points to for  as compared to for interest expense decreased million  or for as compared to despite the fact that interest bearing liabilities increased million during the same period 
this decrease was primarily due to the full year impact of the basis point decline in interest rates that occurred throughout as a result  the total cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to for  as compared to for this decrease in cost of interest bearing liabilities  however  was not in proportion to the decrease in yield on average interest earning assets  resulting in an overall decrease in the net interest margin for the net interest margin on an fte basis decreased to for as compared to for this decrease in net interest margin during was primarily due to the multiple interest rate cuts implemented by the federal reserve during the yield on earning assets decreased basis points during from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  contributing to the growth in the net interest income was the growth in average earning assets during of million or 
average federal funds sold increased to million during from  during  primarily due to the investment of proceeds received from the million issuance of trust preferred securities during the first quarter of and improved management of cash levels in branches and correspondent accounts 
average loans including loans held for sale were million during compared to million during  an increase 
this increase was primarily due to the full year impact of loans obtained in the july united valley merger 
although the average loan balance including loans held for sale increased during  the general softening of the economy during as well as an internal shift toward more conservative underwriting policies in response to the slowing economy resulted in a million decrease in the year end loan balance including loans held for sale at december  from million at december  during  average interest bearing liabilities also grew 
this growth was largely due to an increase in average interest bearing deposits due to the full year impact of deposits obtained in the july united valley merger  a full year effect of deposits from the aspen branch opened during  and new deposits obtained in connection with the opening of the grand junction office during although average interest bearing deposits increased during as a result of the factors previously mentioned  interest bearing deposits at year end decreased million  or between december  and december  this decrease in year end balances was primarily related to deposit attrition resulting from repricing of interest bearing deposit products to reflect the current lower interest rate environment as well as the anticipated million withdrawal during the second quarter of a temporary money market deposit account established in december additionally  during average borrowings increased as a result of the issuance of million of trust preferred securities during first quarter the receipt of the trust preferred proceeds enabled the company to repay outstanding borrowings and resulted in the company selling federal funds instead of purchasing them 
provision for loan losses the amount of the provision for loan losses is based on regular evaluations of the loan portfolio  with particular attention directed toward non performing  delinquent  and other potential problem loans 
during these evaluations  consideration is also given to such factors as management s evaluation of specific loans  the level and composition of delinquent and non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  results of examinations by regulatory agencies  external and internal asset review processes  the market value of collateral  the strength and availability of guarantees  concentrations of credit and other judgmental factors 
the provision for loan losses was  in  compared to  in and million in the decrease in the provision during was due to the company s determination during that the current allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb probable losses in the decreased loan portfolio gross loans were million at december  compared to million at december  
as a result  the company took a smaller provision for loan losses during than it did during net charge offs during were million  resulting in a net decrease in the allowance for loan losses of  compared to a net decrease of  during and a net increase of  in the decrease in the provision during was due to the company s determination during that the current allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb probable losses in the decreased loan portfolio gross loans were million at december  compared to million at december  
as a result  the company took a smaller provision for loan losses during than it did during net charge offs during and were  and  respectively 
during  vail banks also acquired an additional million allowance in connection with the united valley merger 
at december   the allowance was of total loans and of non performing loans 
while non performing loans increased significantly during to million at december  from million at december  causing the allowance to non performing loans ratio to decline  the majority of the non accrual loans are real estate secured  are recorded at net realizable value  and are subject to foreclosure or other collection proceedings that are well underway 
at december   the allowance was of total loans and of non performing loans 
at december   the allowance was of total loans and of non performing loans 
non interest income the following table sets forth vail banks non interest income for the years indicated 
in thousands mortgage broker fees    service charges on deposits    other fee income    rental income  other total non interest income    non interest income grew  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage broker fees partially offset by a decrease in deposit related service charges 
mortgage broker fees increased  or  from due to continued refinancing activity 
during  deposit related income decreased  or due primarily to a decline in the number of deposit account overdrafts and to some degree a general decrease in the number of transaction accounts interest and non interest bearing checking accounts in response to lower interest rates 
non interest income grew million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in mortgage broker fees as well as an increase in deposit related service charges 
mortgage broker fees increased million  or  from due to increased refinancing activity in light of the decline in interest rates 
during  weststar commenced mortgage operations with the acquisition of first western 
during  deposit related income increased million  or due to an increased emphasis by the company on collecting deposit related fees 
non interest expense the following table sets forth vail banks non interest expense for the years indicated 
in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy    furniture and equipment    professional fees  retail banking  banking service fees telephone and data communications marketing and promotions supplies and printing postage and freight amortization of intangible assets   write off of correspondent bank account transactions other    total non interest expense    total non interest expense decreased  during  or  from million in the decrease is primarily due to the elimination of goodwill amortization effective january  and the company s concerted efforts to reduce operational type costs such as postage  supplies and marketing 
these expense reductions were offset by increasing costs of employee related expenses  occupancy expenses and professional fees as well as a full year of operating expenses for the grand junction branch that opened during third quarter total non interest expense increased by million during  or  from million in the increase was primarily due to a full year of operating expenses for branches acquired in the july united valley merger  a full year of goodwill amortization from the united valley merger transaction  operating expenses of the newly opened grand junction branch  and hiring of key management personnel 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million during  or from this increase is primarily due to a full year of salaries expense related to key management personnel hired during  a full year of salaries expense for the grand junction branch opened in third quarter  the replacement of terminated employees with higher costing employees  associated recruiting and hiring costs related to the forementioned employees  and to some extent  the rising cost of employer paid health benefits for employees 
salaries and employee benefits expense for was million  an increase of million from million in this increase is primarily due to hiring of key management personnel  a partial year of salaries expense for the grand junction branch opened in  a full year of salaries expense for the aspen branch opened during and the united valley branches acquired during  the rising cost of employer paid health benefits for employees and an increased employer contribution to the k plan 
full time equivalent associates at december   and were  and  respectively 
expenses associated with fixed assets  including occupancy  furniture and equipment  rose  and  in and  respectively 
increases in were primarily related to a full year of expense related to the grand junction branch opened in  as well as cost of living increases in building rent and property taxes 
increases in were primarily related to a full year of expense related to the aspen branch and the branches acquired in the july united valley merger  as well as the opening of a new branch in grand junction during during  it was determined that certain correspondent bank account transactions were not properly recorded during the fourth quarter of as a result  the company took charges of  during to account for the probable uncollectibility of such items 
the efficiency ratio represents non interest expense as a percentage of the sum of net interest income and non interest income and is a measure of the cost to generate a dollar of revenue 
the efficiency ratio increased in to from in and improved in from in the increase in was largely due to the decline in revenue net interest income plus non interest income of million over while non interest expenses only decreased  during the same period 
the improvement in was largely due to the absence of certain non recurring expenses in that were incurred during ie the write off of certain correspondent bank account transactions and non capitalizable expenses related to the united valley merger 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income was for compared with and for and  respectively 
the amortization of goodwill recorded in and was primarily non deductible for income tax purposes  thus affecting the effective tax rates

a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre tax income is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this annual report on form k 
financial condition investments vail banks investment policy is designed primarily to ensure liquidity and to meet pledging requirements and secondarily to provide acceptable investment income 
management s focus is on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio oriented toward mortgage backed and other government agency securities 
the determination of the amount and maturity of securities purchased is a function of liquidity and income projections based on the existing  and expected  balance sheet and interest rate forecasts 
during  the company purchased two new types of securities for its available for sale investment portfolio  federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc preferred stock and corporate trust preferred securities 
these additional investments enabled the company to further diversify the portfolio as well as to increase total investment yields 
vail banks is required to account for investment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
at the date of purchase  vail banks is required to classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
investments in debt securities are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
since its inception  vail banks has not had any trading account activities 
investments not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
since the initial classification of its investment securities  vail banks has not transferred any investment securities between categories  nor has it sold any investment securities classified as held to maturity 
the following tables set forth information regarding the investment composition of vail banks as of the dates indicated

management believes that the balance sheet information as of the dates indicated should be read in conjunction with the average balance information in the tables above under the caption average balance sheet and net interest income analysis 
vail banks has followed a policy to manage the loan portfolio composition to mitigate risks in specific markets by diversifying the loan portfolio 
however  vail banks does have a concentration of loans in the commercial  industrial and land category 
as a result of seasonal trends in the retail  service and real estate markets  balances of commercial loans may fluctuate significantly 
loans outstanding at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial  industrial  and land   real estate construction    real estate mortgage    consumer     total     at december   gross loans were million  which was a decrease of million  or  over million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the continued softening of the economy and a continued conservative underwriting policy 
gross loans decreased in by million  or from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the general softening of the economy  as well as an internal shift toward more conservative underwriting policies in response to the slowing economy 
commercial  industrial  and land loans principally include loans to service  real estate and retail businesses and to a small degree  agricultural interests 
these loans are primarily secured by real estate and operating business assets 
commercial  industrial and land loans are made on the basis of the repayment ability and financial strength of the borrower as well as the collateral securing the loans 
real estate construction loans principally include short term loans to fund the construction of buildings and residences and or to purchase land for planned and near term commercial or residential development 
these loans are primarily non revolving lines of credit and are secured by real estate  typically well margined with a first security lien 
real estate mortgage loans principally include short term financing for existing one to four family residences 
the majority of these loans have maturities of less than five years 
these loans are secured by the subject real estate  typically well margined with a first lien position 
consumer loans to individuals principally include one to five year loans for consumer items  such as automobiles  snowmobiles  motor homes and other goods 
these loans are typically secured  at minimum  by the items being financed 
banking officers are assigned various levels of credit extension approval authority based upon their respective levels of experience and expertise 
credit relationships exceeding million are evaluated and acted upon by the directors credit committee  which meets weekly  and are reported to the board of directors board on a monthly basis 
vail banks strategy for approving or disapproving extensions of credit is to follow a conservative credit policy and underwriting practices which include i extending credit on a sound and collectible basis  ii investing funds for the benefit of shareholders and the protection of depositors  iii serving the needs of the community and vail banks general market area while obtaining a balance between maximum yield and minimum risk  iv ensuring that primary and secondary sources of repayment are adequate in relation to the amount of the credit extended  v developing and maintaining diversification in the loan portfolio as a whole and of the loans within each loan category  and vi ensuring that each extension of credit is properly documented and  if appropriate  insurance coverage is adequate 
vail banks credit review and compliance personnel interact daily with commercial and consumer lenders to identify potential underwriting or technical exception variances 
in addition  vail banks has placed increased emphasis on early identification of problem loans in an effort to aggressively seek resolution of such situations 
management believes that this strict adherence to conservative credit policy guidelines has contributed to vail banks below average level of credit losses compared to its industry peer group 
loan maturities the following table presents loans by maturity in each major category at december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual repricing maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
loan maturities at december  in thousands within year a years over years total commercial  industrial and land    real estate construction b     real estate mortgage     consumer    total     a of the loans with maturities over one year  million had adjustable interest rates and the remainder had fixed interest rates 
b real estate construction loans have two components a shorter construction phase and a permanent component that can exceed five years 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed properties 
when  in the opinion of management  a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest  regardless of the delinquency status of the loan  the accrual of interest income is discontinued and interest accrued but uncollected during the current year is generally reversed through a charge to current year earnings 
while the loan is on nonaccrual status  interest income is recognized only upon receipt and then only if  in the judgment of management  there is no reasonable doubt as to the collectibility of the principal balance 
loans days or more delinquent generally are changed to nonaccrual status unless the loan is in the process of collection and management determines that full collection of principal and accrued interest is probable 
interest income that would have been recorded for nonaccrual loans had they been performing in accordance with their contractual requirements was  for the year ended december  actual interest income recorded for these loans was  for that year 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including reduction of interest rate below a rate otherwise available to the borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the following table sets forth information concerning the non performing assets of vail banks as of the dates indicated 
asset quality at december  in thousands nonaccrual loans     restructured loans total non performing loans     foreclosed properties total non performing assets     loans days or more past due and accruing total risk assets      non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties non performing assets to total assets risk assets to total loans plus foreclosed properties the significant increase in the ratio of non performing loans to total loans from to is primarily a result of the million increase in non accrual loans from compounded by a million decrease in loans during that same time period 
the increase in non accrual loans was a result of the sluggish economy  however  the majority of the non accrual loans are real estate secured  are recorded at net realizable value  and are subject to foreclosure or other collection proceedings that are underway 
the decrease in loans was primarily due to the continued softening of the economy and a continued conservative underwriting policy 
management believes vail banks is adequately collateralized to recover the majority of the balance of these nonaccrual loans 
management generally obtains and maintains appraisals on real estate collateral 
management is not aware of any adverse trends relating to vail banks loan portfolio  not reflected above 
at december   there were no loans excluded from non performing loans set forth above where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in such loans becoming non performing 
analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries

vail banks lending personnel are responsible for ongoing reviews of the quality of the loan portfolio 
additionally  vail banks engaged an external loan review firm to conduct loan reviews on a periodic basis 
state and federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  also review vail banks loans and its allowance for loan losses 
a list containing any potential problem loans is updated and reviewed by management and the board monthly 
this process results in an allowance that has two components 
the first component represents the allowance for impaired loans computed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas component 
impaired loans are those loans that weststar does not expect to receive all contractual principal and interest due by the contractual due date 
to determine the sfas component  collateral dependent impaired loans are evaluated using internal analyses as well as third party information  such as appraisals 
if an impaired loan is unsecured  it is evaluated using a discounted cash flow of the payments expected over the life of the loan giving consideration to currently existing factors that would impact the amount or timing of the cash flows 
the second component is the allowance calculated under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas component  and represents the estimated probable but undetected losses inherent within the portfolio relating to uncertainties in economic conditions  delinquent loans that have not been determined to be impaired  trends in speculative construction real estate lending  results of internal and external loan reviews  historical loss experience and other factors 
the sfas component is calculated by assigning a certain risk weighting  within a predetermined range  to each identified risk factor 
management believes that vail banks allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses based on all evidence currently available 
future additions to the allowance will be subject to management s continuing evaluation of the inherent risks in the portfolio 
additional provisions for loan losses may need to be recorded if the economy continues to decline  asset quality deteriorates  or historical loss experience changes 
also  state or federal regulators  when reviewing vail banks loan portfolio in the future  may require vail banks to increase the allowance 
based on the foregoing  there can be no assurance that vail banks actual loan losses will not exceed its allowance for loan losses 
in order to comply with certain regulatory requirements  management has prepared the following allocation of vail banks allowance for loan losses among various categories of the loan portfolio for each of the years in the five year period ended december  in management s opinion  such allocation has  at best  a limited utility 
it is based on management s assessment as of a given point in time of the risk characteristics for each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change 
such allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may be taken  nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends 
by presenting such allocation  management does not mean to imply that the allocation is exact or that the allowance has been precisely determined from such allocation 
additionally  during  the company changed its methodology for computing the allowance for loan losses  as discussed above 
a significant portion of the sfas component has not been allocated to each of the four categories specified in the table below  but rather represents loans in all four categories 
it is represented by the term cross allocated in the table below 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses amount in thousands commercial  industrial and land   real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer cross allocated   unallocated total      deposits vail banks primary source of funds has historically been in market customer deposits 
deposit products are concentrated in business and personal checking accounts  including interest bearing and non interest bearing accounts 
generally  deposits are short term in nature with approximately of deposits having a committed term less than three months and approximately having a committed term of less than one year 
vail banks resort locations experience a seasonality of deposits  however  increases in deposits in non resort oriented markets due to recent mergers has helped to mitigate such seasonality 
total deposits were million at december   a million  or a  decrease from the balance at december  this decrease was primarily related to deposit attrition resulting from a decline in money market rates  offset by the introduction of a new short term certificate of deposit cd product 
this new cd enabled weststar to attract new money as well as retain funds from maturing cd s 
non interest bearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits at both december  and total deposits were million at december   a million  or an  decrease from the balance at december  this decrease was primarily related to deposit attrition resulting from repricing of interest bearing deposit products to reflect the current lower interest rate environment as well as the anticipated million withdrawal during the second quarter of a temporary money market deposit established in december during this time period  non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  while interest bearing deposits decreased by million  or  as compared to december  non interest bearing demand deposits comprised of total deposits at december  the following table sets forth the composition of vail banks deposits by type at december   and deposit composition at december  in thousands amount amount amount non interest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    savings    certificates of deposit    total    the following table presents average deposits by type during  and and the related average interest rate paid by deposit type for each of those years

such loans and deposits are on the same terms and conditions as then prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non related parties 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to meet its commitments and obligations with available funds 
these commitments may include paying dividends to shareholders  funding new loans for borrowers  funding withdrawals by depositors  paying general and administrative expenses  and funding capital expenditures 
historically  the company s primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds 
deposit inflows and unscheduled loan repayments  which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions and other factors  are relatively unstable 
other sources of liquidity include sale or maturity of investment securities and the ability to borrow funds 
company borrowing may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
company borrowing may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending and investing activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
cash flows net cash from operating activities during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of million and non cash expenses of million  offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment   of net amortization of premium on investment securities and a  loan loss provision  offset by  of gains on sales of investment securities 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million increase in loans held for sale offset by a  decrease in interest receivable and a  increase in interest payable and other liabilities 
with favorable mortgage interest rates during  refinancings have continued to be strong  accounting for the increase in loans held for sale 
the decline in the loan portfolio during resulted in a related decline in the interest receivable on loans 
the increase in interest payable and other liabilities was partly due to the million increase in fhlb borrowings over december  during the year ended december   net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of million and non cash expenses of million  offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of intangible amortization expense  million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment  an  loan loss provision and  of deferred income tax expense 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million increase in loans held for sale offset by an  decrease in interest receivable 
with the multiple interest rate reductions during  loans held for sale have increased as a result of increased mortgage refinancings 
additionally  the decline in the loan portfolio and reduced interest rates resulted in a related decline in the interest receivable on loans 
during  net cash of million was provided by operating activities consisting primarily of net income of million  non cash expenses of million  and net increases in operating assets and liabilities from of million 
non cash expenses consisted primarily of million of intangible amortization expense  million of depreciation and amortization expense on premises and equipment  a million loan loss provision and  of deferred income tax expense 
the net increase in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a  increase in loans held for sale  a  increase in other assets  and a  decrease in interest payable and other liabilities 
the increase in loans held for sale is the result of loans originated by first western 
first western was purchased by the company on january  net cash from investing activities during  net cash of million was provided by investing activities 
these inflows consisted primarily of a million decrease in net loans  the maturity and or calls of million of investment securities  million from the sales or redemption of investment securities  and million from the sales of premises and equipment 
these inflows were partially offset by million of purchases of investment securities and the purchase of million of premises and equipment to construct and furnish a new building in dillon to replace an existing facility  to construct tenant improvements and furnish a new leased facility in glenwood springs to replace an existing facility  and to upgrade equipment 
during  net cash of million was provided by investing activities

purchases of premises and equipment primarily related to the purchase of land for the planned grand junction and dillon branch buildings  design and construction fees related to these locations  tenant improvements and furnishings for the aspen branch opened during  and to upgrade software and equipment 
these outflows were partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of investment securities obtained in the united valley merger and proceeds of million received from the maturity and or calls of investment securities 
net cash from financing activities during  net cash of million was used in financing activities consisting primarily of a decrease in deposits of million  the repurchase of million of outstanding common stock of the company  and the payment of dividends on common stock of million 
these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
the decrease in deposits was largely attributable to a decline in money market rates  offset by the introduction of a new short term certificate of deposit product 
this new product enabled weststar to attract new money as well as retain funds from maturing certificates of deposit 
during  net cash of million was used in financing activities consisting primarily of a decrease in deposits of million due to multiple rate cuts during and the withdrawal of a million temporary deposit received during december  the repayment of million of short term borrowings  the repurchase of million of outstanding common stock of the company  and the payment of dividends on common stock of million 
these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities and the receipt of million of net proceeds from short and long term fhlb advances 
during  net cash of million was provided by financing activities consisting primarily of an increase in deposits of million due to new deposits obtained by united valley after the date of acquisition and to a lesser degree the marketing of new deposit products  partially offset by the repayment of million of short term borrowings 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for are estimated to be between million and million associated with the construction of a new facility in glenwood springs to replace an existing facility  expansion or remodeling of existing facilities  and routine replacement and upgrades of furniture and equipment 
the company will fund these expenditures from various sources  including operating cash flows  retained earnings and borrowings

dividends payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board and is determined after taking into account earnings  capital levels  cash requirements  and the financial condition of vail banks and weststar  as well as applicable government regulations and other relevant factors 
the principal source of vail banks income is dividends from weststar 
there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by weststar to vail banks  as well as by vail banks to its shareholders 
specifically  approval of the regulators will be required if the total of all dividends declared by any banking subsidiary in any year exceeds the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years 
at december   net assets available from weststar to pay dividends without prior approval from regulatory authorities totaled million 
on january   the board declared a regular quarterly dividend of per share to shareholders of record on january  the dividend of  was paid on february  stock repurchase plan during february  the board authorized the repurchase of up to million in outstanding shares of the company s common stock 
in september  the board reauthorized the repurchase program to allow for a total of million in repurchases including repurchases previously completed through september on october   the board reauthorized the repurchase program  allowing additional repurchases up to million through october since inception of the program in march through december   the company has repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
between january  and february   the company repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of million  or per share 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years fhlb borrowings     trust preferred securities   operating leases   total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands other commercial commitments a total amounts committed less than year years years over years commitments to extend credit b     customer letters of credit    total commercial commitments     a many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
thus the indicated commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
b commitments to extend credit in the years category primarily represent home equity lines of credit which typically have a five year draw period 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents including federal funds sold of million and investment securities of million 
almost of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and can be readily sold to meet liquidity needs 
based on current plans and business conditions  the company expects that its cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities  together with any amounts generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not be required to seek other financing sooner or that such financing  if required  will be available on terms satisfactory to the company 
concentrations of credit risk concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in the economy or other conditions 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and real estate loans located in colorado  making the value of the portfolio susceptible to declines in real estate values and other changes in economic conditions in colorado 
the company does not believe it has excessive exposure to any individual customer 
effect of inflation and changing prices the banking industry is unique in that substantially all of the assets and liabilities are of a monetary nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more profound effect on a bank s performance than does inflation 
although there is not always a direct relationship between the movement in the prices of goods and services and changes in interest rates  increases in inflation generally lead to increases in interest rates 
however  in short periods of time interest rates may not move in the same direction or magnitude as inflation 
asset and liability management vail banks earnings depend to a significant extent on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings 
the net interest margin is highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond vail banks control 
these factors include competitive and general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in the discount rate or targeted federal funds rate by the federal reserve bank usually lead to general changes in interest rates 
these interest rate shifts affect vail banks interest income  interest expense and investment portfolio 
also  governmental policies  such as the creation of a tax deduction for individual retirement accounts  can increase savings and affect the cost of funds 
from time to time  the interest rate structures of earning assets and liabilities may not be balanced  and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations of vail banks 
vail banks cannot predict the nature  timing and effect of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies 
the liquidity position of vail banks is monitored by management and its asset liability committee 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income variances in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments which are approaching maturity 
changes in net interest income can occur when interest rates on interest sensitive assets  such as loans and investment securities  change in a different time period from that of the interest rates on liabilities  such as deposits 
these differences  or gaps  provide an indication of the extent that net interest income may be affected by future changes in interest rates 
a positive gap exists when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities and indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given time period 
with a positive gap  rising rate environments generally enhance earnings  while a declining rate environment has a tendency to depress earnings 
conversely  a negative gap exists when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets 
with a negative gap  rising rate environments usually depress earnings  while declining rate environments tend to enhance earnings 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of vail banks assets and liabilities at december   and sets forth the repricing dates of vail banks interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as vail banks interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
this table indicates vail banks is in an asset sensitive or positive gap position for the twelve month period ending december  during that period  million of interest earning assets will reprice compared to million of interest bearing liabilities 
this asset sensitive position would generally indicate that vail banks net interest income would decrease should interest rates fall and increase should interest rates rise 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of the repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same 
the table is based on assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment  and since such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the following table does not necessarily indicate the actual future impact of interest rate movements on vail banks net interest income

vail banks and weststar are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by governmental banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct  material effect on vail banks performance 
vail banks and weststar must meet specific capital adequacy guidelines and weststar must meet guidelines under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that together involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
vail banks and weststar s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require vail banks and weststar to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier capital to average assets 
see supervision and regulation in item for explanations of these terms and requirements

qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk arising from the instruments and transactions into which the company enters 
these include loans  securities available for sale  deposit liabilities  and borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when interest sensitive assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to repricing in the near term  including both variable rate instruments and those fixed rate instruments that are approaching maturity 
for example  if fixed rate assets are funded with floating rate debt  the spread between asset and liability rates will decline or turn negative if rates increase 
additionally  interest rate risk results from changing spreads between asset and liability rates 
interest rate risk is managed by the company s asset liability committee 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
during and  the company did not use interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposures 
during  vail banks experienced increased liquidity as the result of a decrease in loan demand 
the increase in liquidity was used to invest in investment securities and short term federal funds sold 
this increased liquidity position increased the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet 
therefore  vail banks was more sensitive to changes in interest rates at december  than at december  during  the company faces risk primarily from the possibility of lower interest rates 
given the company s gap position at december   if rates fall  asset yields will decline faster than the cost of interest bearing liabilities  leading to a decline in the margin 
the extent of this decline will depend on the degree to which retail deposit rates change relative to market rates 
the reduction in short term rates by the federal reserve during and effectively repriced a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio 
while it also produced an opportunity to reduce funding costs  at the current level of interest rates  further reductions in funding costs may be more limited
