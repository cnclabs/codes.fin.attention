item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto referred to in item financial statements and supplemental data  and items and business and properties disclosures regarding forward looking statements of this form k 
overview we are a development stage independent oil and gas exploration company whose strategic focus is the application of advanced seismic imaging and computer aided exploration technologies in the systematic search for commercial hydrocarbon reserves  primarily in the onshore western united states 
we attempt to leverage our technical experience and expertise with seismic data to identify exploration and exploitation projects with significant potential economic return 
we intend to participate in selected exploration projects as a working interest owner  currently as a non operator  sharing both risk and rewards with our partners 
our financial results depend on our ability to sell prospect interests to outside industry participants 
we will not be able to commence exploratory drilling operations without outside industry participation 
we have pursued  and will continue to pursue  exploration opportunities in regions where we believe significant opportunity for discovery of oil and gas exists 
by attempting to reduce drilling risk through seismic technology  we seek to improve the expected return on investment in our oil and gas exploration projects 
our future financial results continue to depend primarily on our ability to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  the market price for oil and gas  our ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  and our ability to fully implement our exploration and development program with respect to these and other matters 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects or that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had approximately  in working capital 
during the year ended august   our capitalized costs for oil and gas properties decreased by approximately  the decrease is the result of an impairment taken against our oil and gas properties in the amount of  during the year  net of approximately  of costs incurred for drilling and completion  geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and other related direct costs with respect to our exploration and development projects  and net asset retirement obligation assets of approximately  during the fiscal year ended august   our capitalized costs for oil and gas properties decreased by approximately  the decrease is the result of an impairment taken against our oil and gas properties in the amount of  and  in seismic sales credited to the full cost pool during the fiscal year ended august  the decrease was offset by approximately  of costs incurred for drilling and completion  geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals  and other related direct costs with respect to our exploration and development projects 
during the fiscal year ended august   our capitalized costs for oil and gas properties decreased by approximately  the decrease is the result of an impairment taken against our oil and gas properties in the amount of  offset by approximately  of costs incurred for drilling and completion  the cost of acquiring an additional working interest in our east lost hills project  transportation pipeline costs  production facilities costs  delay rentals  and other related direct costs with respect to our exploration and development projects 
during the quarter ended november   the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock converted all of the remaining outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock at a conversion price of 
per share 
this resulted in a cashless transaction whereby  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were converted into a total of  shares of common stock 
at november   there were no remaining shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding 
in november  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock issued in connection with the private placement of the series a convertible preferred stock were exercised at the exercise price of per share 
in december  warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock were exercised 
we received  in cash as the result of these exercises 
there are no additional outstanding warrants associated with this private placement 
during the quarter ended november   warrants issued in conjunction with a private placement that was completed in may were exercised to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
total proceeds received from this warrant exercise were  previously during the fiscal year ended august   warrants issued in the may private placement had been exercised to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock for total proceeds of  during december  all the remaining outstanding warrants from the may private placement were exercised to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock  resulting in aggregate proceeds to us of  during november and january  warrants issued in conjunction with the august private placement were exercised to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
this resulted in proceeds to us of  during january  the holders of the remaining outstanding warrants issued in connection with a private placement that was completed in may exercised their warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock for  on march   we received an aggregate  in gross proceeds through the sale of  shares of our common stock 
the common stock was sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement and prospectus supplement 
after costs and expenses  we received a net of  investors consisted of a total of ten separate funds managed by four california based institutions 
in may  we received  in gross proceeds from the sale of convertible notes which resulted in long term debt of  at august  we had no outstanding long term debt at august  we have not entered into any commodity swap arrangements or hedging transactions 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may enter into commodity swap and hedging transactions in the future in conjunction with oil and gas production 
it is anticipated that the continuation and future development of our business will require additional  and possibly substantial  capital expenditures 
at this time  our ongoing administrative and operating overhead exceeds our incoming revenue  and we have no reliable source for additional funds for administration and operations to the extent our existing funds have been utilized 
in addition  our capital expenditure budget for the fiscal year ending august  will depend on our success in selling additional prospects for cash  the level of industry participation in our exploration projects  the availability of debt or equity financing  and the results of our activities  including continuing results at our east lost hills project 
we anticipate spending a minimum of approximately  for capital expenditures relating to our existing drilling commitments and related development expenses  and other exploration costs 
to limit capital expenditures  we intend to form industry alliances and exchange an appropriate portion of our interest for cash and or a carried interest in our exploration projects 
we may need to raise additional funds to cover capital expenditures 
these funds may come from cash flow  equity or debt financings  a credit facility  or sales of interests in our properties  although there is no assurance additional funding will be available 
capital expenditures during fiscal  we incurred approximately  of capital costs relating to our east lost hills project 
we incurred approximately  for costs related to our other exploration projects including continued acreage lease obligations and associated geological and geophysical costs 
revenues from oil and gas production during were  during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs relating to drilling and completing wells at our east lost hills project 
we incurred approximately  for costs related to our other exploration projects including continued acreage lease obligations and associated geological and geophysical costs 
revenues from oil and gas production during were during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs relating to drilling and completing wells at our east lost hills project  and for acquiring an additional working interest at east lost hills 
we incurred approximately  for costs related to our other exploration projects including continued leasing and optioning of acreage 
we generated  in revenues from oil and gas production during during fiscal  we incurred approximately  for costs related to continued leasing and optioning of acreage and approximately  for drilling and seismic costs associated with deep exploratory drilling at our east lost hills project 
we had no revenues from oil and gas production during we currently anticipate that we will participate in the drilling of up to three exploration wells during our fiscal year ending august   although the number of wells may increase as additional projects are added to our portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that any such wells will be drilled and if drilled that any of these wells will be successful 
our future financial results continue to depend primarily on our ability to discover commercial quantities of hydrocarbons  the market price for oil and gas  our ability to continue to source and screen potential projects  and our ability to fully implement our exploration and development program with respect to these and other matters 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of these respects or that the prices of oil and gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations and commitments to make future payments under its convertible notes payable and office lease for the periods specified as of august  payments due by period contractual year ended fiscal years fiscal years fiscal year obligations total august  and after convertible notes   office lease   total contractual    cash obligations the above schedule assumes convertible note interest payments will be added to the principal amount which is at the discretion of the company  and the entire balance will be paid in full on maturity of may   and there will be no conversion of debt to common stock 
in addition to the above obligations  if we elect to continue holding all our existing leases on a delayed rental basis  we would have to pay approximately  during the year ending august  the company considers on a quarterly basis whether to continue holding all or part of each acreage block by making delay rental payments on existing leases 
results of operations the twelve months ended august  compared with the twelve months ended august  operations during the fiscal year ended august  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended august  oil and gas revenues and expenses 
during the year ended august   we recorded  from the sale of  mcf of natural gas for an average price of per mcf  and  for the sale of  bbls of hydrocarbon liquids for an average price of per bbl 
during the year ended august   we recorded  from the sale of  mcf of natural gas for an average price of per mcf  and  from the sale of  bbls of hydrocarbon liquids for an average price of per bbl 
lease operating expenses in were  compared to  in interest income 
we recorded  and  in interest income for the years ended august  and  respectively 
lower interest income in resulted from lower average cash balances in than in  as cash was utilized throughout to fund the company s operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in were  compared to  in the lower expense in reflects reduced salary and wage expenses following staff resignations  and lower costs incurred for financial advisory services in compared to depreciation depletion and amortization 
we recorded no depreciation  depletion and amortization expense from oil and gas properties for the years ended august  and august  the elh well continued producing throughout and  however  because we have recorded an impairment against our entire amortizable full cost pool at both august  and there were no costs to amortize 
we recorded  and  in depreciation expense associated with capitalized office furniture and equipment during and  respectively 
included in depreciation expense reported for  is  of depreciation of asset retirement obligation assets  and  of accretion of the unamortized discount of the asset retirement obligation liability 
for further discussion of the asset retirement obligation  see note to the financial statements included in this form k 
dry hole  impairment and abandonments 
in we recorded an impairment expense of  of which  related to costs incurred in the east lost hills prospect  and the remainder   related to other undeveloped prospects in california and the rocky mountain region  which were determined by management to be impaired as of august  in  we recorded an impairment expense of  primarily for the remaining basis in our east lost hills project 
additionally  approximately  of the impairment charge related to a colorado exploration project where an unsuccessful exploration well was drilled in october although properties may be considered as evaluated for purposes of the ceiling test and included in the impairment calculation  until these properties are completely abandoned  we may continue to incur related costs 
until we can establish economic reserves  of which there is no assurance  additional costs associated with these properties are charged directly to impairment expense as incurred 
interest expense 
during  we recorded interest expense of  compared to  in the increase reflects the existence of  in convertible notes for the entirety of compared to only months of the notes are due may   and call for semi annual interest payments at an annual rate of and are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the interest can be paid in cash or added to the principal amount at the option of the company 
during  the company elected to add  of accrued interest to the balance of the debt 
we have reflected the outstanding balance of these notes as convertible notes under long term debt on our august  and balance sheets 
the twelve months ended august  compared with the twelve months ended august  operations during the fiscal year ended august  resulted in a net loss of  compared with a net loss  for the fiscal year ended august  oil and gas revenues and expenses 
during the year ended august   we recorded  from the sale of  mcf of natural gas for an average price of per mcf and  from the sale of  bbls of hydrocarbon liquids for an average price of per barrel 
lease operating expenses during this period were  during the year ended august   we recorded  from the sale of  mcf of natural gas for an average price of per mcf and  from the sale of  bbls of hydrocarbon liquids for an average price of per barrel 
lease operating expenses during this period were  production commenced at the east lost hills elh well on february  prior to this date  none of our oil or gas properties was producing 
interest income 
we recorded  and  in interest income for the years ended august  and august   respectively 
interest income was higher in the prior fiscal year due to interest earned on cash balances remaining from the common stock offering in march and the private placement completed in august of general and administrative expense 
we incurred  and  in general and administrative expenses during and  respectively 
the increase results primarily from the value of warrants issued in conjunction with a financial advisory agreement 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we recorded no depreciation  depletion and amortization expense from oil and gas properties for the years ended august  or august  although the elh began producing during  we recorded an impairment against our entire amortizable full cost pool both at august  and august   and therefore had no costs to amortize 
we recorded  and  in depreciation expense associated with capitalized office furniture and equipment during the years ended august  and august   respectively 
dry hole  impairment and abandonments 
in  we recorded an impairment expense of  primarily for the remaining basis in our east lost hills project 
additionally  approximately  of the current year impairment charge related primarily to a colorado exploration project where an unsuccessful exploration well was drilled in october although properties may be considered as evaluated for purposes of the ceiling test and included in the impairment calculation  until these properties are completely abandoned  we may continue to incur related costs 
until we can establish economic reserves  of which there is no assurance  additional costs associated with these properties are charged directly to impairment expense as incurred 
in  we recorded an impairment of  against our oil and gas properties as the result of the capitalized costs of a portion of our oil and gas properties exceeding the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves 
the costs from this impairment related primarily to our east lost hills project  and included costs for our southeast maricopa project and our interests in the cal canal and lucky dog prospects in the approximate amount of  interest expense 
we recorded  in interest expense for the year ended august  and no interest expense for the year ended august  the current year interest expense results from the may  sale of convertible notes  for which we received million in gross proceeds 
the notes are due may   and call for semi annual interest payments at an annual rate of and are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the interest can be paid in cash or added to the principal amount at the discretion of the company 
we have reflected the outstanding balance of these notes as convertible notes under long term debt on our august  balance sheet 
the twelve months ended august  compared with the twelve months ended august  operations during the fiscal year ended august  resulted in a net loss of  compared with a net loss  for the fiscal year ended august  oil and gas revenues and expenses 
production commenced at the east lost hills elh well on february  we recorded  from the sale of  mcf of natural gas for an average price of per mcf and  from the sale of  bbls of hydrocarbon liquids for an average price of per barrel during the year ended august  lease operating expenses during this period were  we recorded no revenues or expenses from oil and gas operations for the year ended august  none of our oil or gas properties was producing before february  interest income 
we recorded  and  in interest income for the years ended august  and august   respectively 
the increase in the year ended august  is attributable to interest earned on cash balances remaining from the common stock offering in march and the private placement completed in august of general and administrative expense 
we incurred  and  in general and administrative expenses during and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to unrecoverable financing costs and increases in personnel and salaries 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we recorded no depreciation  depletion and amortization expense from oil and gas properties for the years ended august  or august  although we commenced our first production during  we recorded an impairment against our entire amortizable full cost pool at august   and therefore had no costs to amortize 
in the prior year  none of our oil and gas properties were producing  and therefore no dd a expense was recognized 
we recorded  and  in depreciation expense associated with capitalized office furniture and equipment during the years ended august  and august   respectively 
dry hole  impairment and abandonments 
in  we recorded an impairment of  against our oil and gas properties as the result of the capitalized costs of a portion of our oil and gas properties exceeding the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves 
the costs from this impairment relating to our east lost hills project include drilling and completion costs associated with our working interests in the elh  elh  elh  bellevue and r wells and allocated land  geological and geophysical costs 
in addition  we have recorded property impairments with respect to our southeast maricopa project and our interests in the cal canal and lucky dog prospects in the approximate amount of  in  we recorded an impairment of  against our cal canal project 
interest expense 
we recorded no interest expense for the year ended august  and nominal interest expense for the year ended august  critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geological and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from there may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
many factors will affect actual net cash flows  including the following the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for natural gas  curtailments or increases in consumption by natural gas purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
property  equipment and depreciation we follow the full cost method to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities 
under the full cost method  all costs incurred which are directly related to oil and gas exploration and development are capitalized and subjected to depreciation and depletion 
depletable costs also include estimates of future development costs of proved reserves 
costs related to undeveloped oil and gas properties may be excluded from depletable costs until those properties are evaluated as either proved or unproved 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling limitation based on the estimated present value of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves 
as a result  we are required to estimate our proved reserves at the end of each quarter  which is subject to the uncertainties described in the previous section 
gains or losses upon disposition of oil and gas properties are treated as adjustments to capitalized costs  unless the disposition represents a significant portion of the company s proved reserves 
revenue recognition the company recognizes oil and gas revenues from its interests in producing wells as oil and gas is produced and sold from these wells 
the company has no gas balancing arrangements in place 
oil and gas sold is not significantly different from the company s product entitlement 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas generally requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have any impact on its financial position or results of operations  sfas  acquisitions of certain financial institutions  was issued in december and is not expected to apply to the company s current or planned activities 
in december  the fasb approved sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the company will continue to account for stock based compensation using the methods detailed in the stock based compensation accounting policy 
in april  the fasb approved sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is not expected to apply to the company s current or planned activities 
in june  the fasb approved sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  sfas is not expected to have an effect on the company s financial position 
in  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement requires companies to record the present value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
the liability is capitalized as part of the related long lived asset s carrying amount 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the expected useful life of the related asset 
the company s asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the plugging  dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities of its oil and gas properties 
prior to adoption of this statement  such obligations were accrued ratably over the productive lives of the assets through its depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties without recording a separate liability for such amounts 
the transition adjustment related to adopting sfas on september  was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect on net income of adopting sfas no 
was a net unfavorable effect of  at the time of adoption  total assets increased  and total liabilities increased  the amounts recognized upon adoption are based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future recoverable quantities of oil and gas  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rate
