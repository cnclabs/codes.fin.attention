item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sysco provides marketing and distribution services to foodservice customers throughout the united states and canada 
the company intends to continue to expand its market share through profitable sales growth  foldouts and acquisitions 
the company also strives to increase the effectiveness of its marketing associates  its consolidated buying programs and the productivity of its warehousing and distribution activities 
these objectives require continuing investment 
sysco s resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets 
sysco s operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  fleet and other equipment required to meet customers needs  cash dividends  and acquisitions compatible with the company s overall growth strategy 
any remaining cash generated from operations may  at the discretion of management  be applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program  while the remainder of the cost may be financed with additional long term debt 
sysco s share repurchase program is used primarily to offset shares issued under various employee benefit and compensation plans  for acquisitions and to reduce shares outstanding  which may have the net effect of increasing earnings per share 
management targets a long term debt to total capitalization ratio between and 
the ratio may exceed the target range from time to time due to borrowings incurred in order to fund acquisitions and internal growth opportunities and due to fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
the ratio also may fall below the target range due to strong cash flow from operations and fluctuations in the timing and amount of share repurchases 
this ratio was and at june  and june   respectively 
the company generated net cash from operations of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the overall increases in operating results contributed to the annual increases in cash flows from operations 
in addition  several factors also contributed to the increase in cash flow from operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company began reorganizing its supply chain to maximize consolidated efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of the merchandising and procurement functions performed for the benefit of customers 
the new structure results in the deferral of certain federal and state income tax payments and is reflected in the increase in net deferred taxes 
tax payments made during the year of  were  less than tax payments made in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the deferrals discussed above as well as the impact of other temporary differences and the timing and amount of tax payments 
the company estimates the cash flow savings from this deferral in fiscal to be approximately  as compared to approximately  in fiscal the company expects the positive cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal and beyond to be less than fiscal levels  as it will begin making payments related to these deferrals in fiscal the company expects the net cash flow impact of deferrals in fiscal and beyond to be incrementally positive when compared to what would have been paid on an annual basis without the deferral due to the company s belief that its volume through the new structure will continue to grow 
in addition  a federal tax payment of  normally due in the fourth quarter of was deferred until the first quarter of as allowed by the internal revenue service  due to the texas tropical storm allison disaster  and is reflected in the decrease of accrued income taxes in fiscal cash flow from operations for fiscal was positively impacted by increases in accounts payable balances offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances and decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
increased sales volumes over the comparable periods contributed to the increase in accounts receivable balances 
sysco has also experienced sales increases with national contract customers that have outpaced the sales increases from marketing associate served customers 
national contract customers payment terms are traditionally longer than the sysco average 
in addition  sysco had approximately  in receivables past due at year end from a us military contractor that have since been paid 
the increased sales volumes also contributed to the increase in inventory balances 
the increase in accounts payable balances was partially due to the increased inventory balances and was significantly aided by an increase in accounts payable days outstanding over the comparable period 
a contributor to the decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities was the increase in pension contributions from  in fiscal to  in fiscal cash used for investing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal expenditures for facilities  fleet and other equipment were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the construction of fold out facilities in las vegas  nevada and ventura  california  replacement facilities in cleveland  ohio  dallas  texas  and miami  florida and the northeast redistribution center in front royal  virginia first phase of the national supply chain initiative 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the construction of fold out facilities located in sacramento  california  columbia  south carolina  and las vegas  nevada 
fiscal expenditures also included costs incurred on the construction or expansion of facilities in dallas  texas  norman  oklahoma  baraboo  wisconsin  and jersey city  new jersey 
total expenditures in fiscal are expected to increase to the range of  to  due to the continuation of the fold out program  facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  the company s supply chain initiatives  and investments in technology 
expenditures for acquisitions of businesses were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal the national supply chain project is expected to create a more efficient and effective supply chain infrastructure for sysco  its suppliers and its customers 
the project entails the implementation of regional distribution centers  which will aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products from all sysco operating companies in the region 
the project is expected to achieve lower costs of inventory  transportation  product handling and transaction processing in addition to lowering working capital and future facility expansion needs at the operating companies 
the northeast redistribution center is expected to be operational in the summer of the center will receive and distribute food and food related products to sysco operating companies in the northeast  creating benefits for customers and suppliers  as well as for sysco 
in november  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of june    shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 
cash used for financing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal in september  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares  which was completed during fiscal in july  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares 
under this authorization   shares remained available for purchase at june  in september  the board authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years was  shares for  in fiscal   shares for  in fiscal  and  shares for  in fiscal dividends paid were  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal sysco began paying the current quarterly dividend rate of per share in january  an increase from the per share that became effective in january in may  sysco declared its regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in september  sysco also declared its regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of fiscal of per share  payable in october in april  sysco issued  principal amount of notes due july  under a shelf registration statement filed in june these notes  which were priced at of par  are unsecured and are not subject to any sinking fund requirement 
they include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption 
proceeds from the notes were used to pay down borrowings under the company s commercial paper program 
as of august   there was  in principal amount outstanding under the previously filed registration statement  leaving  available for issuance 
concurrent with the issuance of these notes  sysco entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  whereby sysco received a fixed rate equal to per annum and paid a benchmark interest rate of six month libor in arrears less basis points 
in june  sysco terminated this swap agreement and received approximately  representing the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of termination 
a corresponding amount is reflected as an increase in the carrying value of the related debt to reflect its fair value at termination 
this increase in the carrying value of the debt is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
in may  sysco international  co  a wholly owned subsidiary of sysco  issued notes totaling  due june  in a private offering 
these notes  which were priced at of par  were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by sysco corporation  were not subject to any sinking fund requirement  included registration rights for the note holders  and included a redemption provision which allowed sysco international  co 
to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to insure that the note holders were not penalized by the early redemption 
in december  sysco international  co 
completed a registered exchange offer for these notes 
in the exchange offer  all of the outstanding  notes were exchanged for new notes which are identical in all respects to the outstanding notes except that the new notes are registered under the securities act of the new notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by sysco corporation 
the proceeds from these notes were utilized to repay commercial paper borrowings issued by sysco international  co 
to fund the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice business 
sysco has uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to  at june  and up to  at june  there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit as of june  or august  sysco has a commercial paper program in the united states which was supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of  as of june  maturing in fiscal sysco also has a commercial paper program in canada which is supported by a bank credit facility in the amount of  in canadian dollars maturing in fiscal during fiscal  and  commercial paper and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately  to   to  and  to  respectively 
commercial paper borrowings were  as of june  and  as of august  the company intends to settle outstanding commercial paper borrowings when they come due by issuing additional debt or retiring them utilizing cash generated from operations 
total debt at june  was  of which approximately was at fixed rates averaging and the remainder was at floating rates averaging 
sysco continues to have borrowing capacity available and alternative financing arrangements are evaluated as appropriate 
in summary  sysco believes that through continual monitoring and management of assets together with the availability of additional capital in the financial markets  it will meet its cash requirements while maintaining proper liquidity for normal operating purposes 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth certain information concerning sysco s obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements payments due by period total over obligations year years years years years years in thousands short term debt and commercial paper    long term debt        capital lease obligations      long term non capitalized leases        total contractual cash obligations        included in other long term liabilities of  as of june  are sysco s obligations related to pension and deferred compensation plans 
sales sales increased in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the annual sales increases were attributable to a variety of factors  including the progress of sysco s customers are really everything to sysco cares customer relationship initiatives  a persistent focus on increasing sales to marketing associate served customers  the continuing recognition by customers of the quality and value of sysco brand products  the overall growth in the foodservice industry and acquisitions 
real sales growth  calculated as total sales growth less non comparable acquisitions and adjusted for internally estimated product cost inflation or deflation  was approximately in fiscal acquisitions represented of sales increases for fiscal and there was no inflation or deflation 
product costs trended upward during the last half of the fiscal year  reversing the deflationary pressures experienced during the first half of the year  resulting in a flat rate for the entire year 
real sales growth is a non gaap financial measure as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
management believes it is a useful indicator of the company s organic growth without regard to acquisitions and inflation 
after adjusting for acquisitions and inflation  real sales growth was approximately in acquisitions represented of sales increases for fiscal and inflation was 
after adjusting for acquisitions and inflation  real sales growth was approximately in fiscal acquisitions represented of total sales in fiscal and inflation was approximately 
the lower sales growth in was attributable to the overall softness in the economy and comparisons to sales increases in fiscal industry sources estimate the total foodservice market experienced a real sales decline of approximately in calendar year and zero real sales growth in calendar year sysco s sales for fiscal through were as follows fiscal year sales increase a comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below canned and dry products fresh and frozen meats frozen fruits  vegetables  bakery and other poultry dairy products fresh produce paper and disposables seafoods beverage products janitorial products equipment and smallwares medical supplies a comparison of sales by type of customer during the last three years is presented below restaurants hospitals and nursing homes schools and colleges hotels and motels all other cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  the increase in cost of sales resulted in gross margins as a percent of sales decreasing percentage points compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to two factors 
first  multi unit sales growth of was greater than marketing associate served sales growth of 
multi unit sales tend to have lower gross margins coupled with lower expenses than marketing associate served sales 
secondly  fresh cut meat sales grew as a percentage of overall sales 
as these are higher price and lower gross margin percentage products  this had the effect of decreasing overall gross margins as a percent of sales even as gross margin dollars increased 
in and  the rate of increase in cost of sales was less than the rate of sales increase leading to improved gross margins 
the rate of increase in gross margins is influenced by sysco s overall customer and product mix  economies realized in purchasing and higher sales of sysco brand products 
operating expenses operating expenses include the costs of warehousing and delivering products as well as selling and administrative expenses 
these expenses as a percent of sales were for fiscal and for fiscal and changes in the percentage relationship of operating expenses to sales result from an interplay of several factors  including customer mix 
inflationary increases in operating costs generally have been offset through improved productivity 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was primarily attributable to improved operating efficiencies as demonstrated by improving trends in key expense metrics including pieces sold per delivery and product line items sold per delivery 
these operating expense improvements were partially offset by increases in net pension costs of  and by increases in expenses incurred in connection with the national supply chain initiative of  operating expenses in fiscal were negatively impacted by increased costs realized during the initial operating periods of fold outs in sacramento  california  columbia  south carolina  and las vegas  nevada 
in addition  the increase in marketing associate served sales is accompanied by higher expenses to serve these customers 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased  or approximately over fiscal  which had decreased  or approximately below fiscal the increase in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to increased borrowings  partially offset by decreases in interest rate levels 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in interest rates for short term and commercial paper borrowings 
interest capitalized during construction periods for the past three years was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal other  net other  net was income of  in fiscal  an increase of  from the income of  in fiscal fiscal s income of  increased  from the  expense in fiscal changes between the years result from fluctuations in miscellaneous activities  primarily gains and losses on the sale of surplus facilities 
earnings before income taxes earnings before income taxes in fiscal rose  or approximately above fiscal which had increased  or approximately  over fiscal additional sales and realization of operating efficiencies contributed to the increases 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  and sysco anticipates an effective tax rate of in fiscal the increase is attributable to the increasing effective rates of state income taxes 
net earnings fiscal represents the twenty seventh consecutive year of increased net earnings 
net earnings rose  or approximately above fiscal  which had increased  or approximately over fiscal the increases were caused by additional sales  operating efficiencies and other factors discussed above 
return on average shareholders equity the return on average shareholders equity was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal and fiscal since its inception  sysco has averaged in excess of an return on average shareholders equity before the cumulative effect of accounting changes 
broadline segment broadline segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal and sales growth was due primarily to increased sales to marketing associate served and multi unit customers  including increased sales of sysco brand products  as well as the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation 
the sales growth was obtained through increased sales to the existing customer base as well as the acquisition of new customers 
broadline segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal which decreased from in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the acquisition of a canadian broadline foodservice operation 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to acquisitions of specialty meat  lodging industry product and produce companies in the other segments and greater percentage growth of specialty meat  lodging industry companies and sygma segment as a percentage of overall sysco sales 
earnings before income taxes for the broadline segment increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increases in earnings before income taxes for fiscal and fiscal were driven by improved operating efficiencies as well as increased sales to multi unit and marketing associate served customers and increases in sales of sysco brand products 
sygma segment sygma segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the fiscal sales growth was primarily due to sales growth in sygma s existing customer base as well as the acquisition of two quickservice operations 
sales growth in fiscal was due primarily to sales growth in sygma s existing customer base 
sygma segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal which increased from in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to the sales growth in the broadline and other segments 
earnings before income taxes for the sygma segment increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales 
the increase in fiscal was due to operating efficiencies and improved labor productivity realized during the fiscal year 
other segments other segment sales increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal other segment sales as a percentage of total sysco sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal which increased from in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to sales growth in our custom meat cutting operations as well as the timing of acquisitions made during the year 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the year 
earnings before income taxes for the other segment increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the acquisition of a specialty distributor of products to the asian foodservice market  increased earnings from increased gross margins and operating efficiencies at the company s specialty produce operations  and increased earnings from increased sales and gross margins at the company s specialty lodging industry products operations 
these were offset by expenses incurred on a start up operation supplying the health care industry and decreased earnings at the company s specialty meat cutting operations 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased gross margins as meat costs increased in a highly inflationary period 
gross margin percentages on products priced on a mark up per pound basis are difficult to maintain during inflationary periods 
the increase in fiscal was due primarily to the timing of acquisitions made during the periods presented but was offset by a decrease due to the downturn in demand in travel and resort destination cities which are serviced by certain of the specialty companies 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting polices employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
senior management has reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates and this related disclosure 
sysco s most critical accounting policies pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  pension plans and accounting for business combinations 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sysco evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
in addition  allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
the company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including bankruptcy  accounts referred to outside parties for collection and accounts past due over specified periods 
if the financial condition of sysco s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program sysco maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
pension plans sysco maintains defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees 
the company also contributes to various multi employer plans under collective bargaining agreements 
the defined benefit pension plans pay benefits to employees at retirement using formulas based on a participant s years of service and compensation 
sysco also maintains a non qualified  unfunded supplementary executive retirement plan serp for key employees 
in order to meet its obligations under the serp  the company maintains life insurance policies on the lives of participants 
sysco is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies  which are excluded from plan assets in arriving at prepaid accrued benefit cost 
cash surrender values of such policies were  at june  and  at june  sysco accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and these statements require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
for guidance in determining the discount rate  sysco refers to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments  including  among other items  moody s long term aa corporate bond yields 
the discount rate utilized by sysco was and as of june  and june   respectively 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate  as it was at june   when the discount rate was reduced to from and at june  when the discount rate was reduced to from 
the discount rate assumption utilized impacts the recorded amount of pension expense 
the decrease in the discount rate used at june  increased sysco s net pension expense for fiscal by approximately  the decrease in the discount rate of at june  will increase sysco s pension expense for fiscal by approximately  sysco looks to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels 
sysco used a plan specific age related set of rates equivalent to a single rate of  as of june  and june  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was and as of june  and june   respectively 
the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was   and a negative over the twenty year  ten year  five year and one year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in nine of the last fifteen years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate as it was at june  when the expected return was reduced to from and at june  when the expected return was reduced to from 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of pension expense 
the decrease in the assumed rate of return increased sysco s net pension expense for fiscal by approximately  the decrease in the expected return of at june  will increase sysco s net pension expense for fiscal by approximately  amortization of unrecognized net asset losses increased pension expense for fiscal year by approximately  and is expected to further increase pension expense for fiscal year by approximately  changes in assumptions regarding the discount rate together with actual returns on plan assets below the expected return assumptions resulted in the company being required to reflect a cumulative adjustment to other comprehensive income with respect to minimum pension liability of  net of tax  as of june  and  net of tax  as of june  minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in the pension liability and an offsetting charge to shareholders equity  net of tax  through comprehensive loss rather than net income 
the company s prepaid pension cost prior to the recognition of the additional minimum pension liability was  and  at june  and june   respectively 
included in arriving at accrued benefit cost as of june  and june   respectively  are  and  in deferred net actuarial losses resulting from the variance of actual experience from that projected by actuarial assumptions 
a portion of this unrecognized loss is amortized and recognized in accordance with sfas no 
in pension expense over time 
the company recognized net pension costs of  net of an expected asset return of  and  net of an expected asset return of  for fiscal years and  respectively 
changes in the assumptions together with the normal growth of the plan and the impact of losses from prior periods  increased net pension cost  in fiscal and is expected to increase fiscal by  the company s cash contributions to its pension plans were  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
for the past several years no contributions have been required to be made to the qualified pension trust  as determined by government regulations  however  sysco has chosen to voluntarily make contributions 
in fiscal  contributions to the qualified pension trust will also not be required as determined by government regulations 
accounting for business combinations goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  sysco assesses the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values 
the evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions in the industry 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
new accounting standards sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  effective at the beginning of fiscal as a result  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued 
management completed its assessment of the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
had on the company s consolidated financial statements and determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill 
had goodwill amortization been discontinued for all the fiscal years reported  sysco s pro forma net earnings and diluted earnings per share were  and in fiscal   and in fiscal and  and in fiscal sysco adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective in fiscal the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sysco has adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and also requires a guarantor to make certain disclosures regarding guarantees 
this interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements became effective for sysco s financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
sysco adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  in the third quarter of fiscal sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation if a company elects to adopt these provisions 
sfas no 
also specifies required disclosures of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sysco has adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the provisions of eitf no 
are effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  with certain provisions effective for arrangements entered into after november  sysco s historical accounting policies are consistent with the provisions of eitf no 
and thus sysco chose to adopt this accounting policy during the third quarter of fiscal eitf no 
provides guidance as to the recognition and classification of monies received from vendors 
the adoption of this consensus did not have an impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
sysco adopted the provisions of the eitf issue  recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination  effective october eitf no 
addresses the intangible asset recognition criteria of sfas no 
 business combinations  and provides that an intangible asset related to customer relationship intangibles may exist even though the relationship is not evidenced by a contract 
the adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf no 
addresses how to account for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and provides guidance relating to when such arrangements should be divided into components for revenue recognition purposes 
the consensus will be effective for agreements entered into in fiscal with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this consensus will not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
this interpretation introduces a new consolidation model  the variable interests model  which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the interpretation s consolidation provisions apply immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities vie s created after january  and apply in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to vie s acquired before february  the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements 
risk factors low margin business  economic sensitivity the foodservice distribution industry is characterized by relatively high inventory turnover with relatively low profit margins 
sysco makes a significant portion of its sales at prices that are based on the cost of products it sells plus a percentage markup 
as a result  sysco s profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation  even though sysco s gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant 
product cost inflation could also have a negative impact on profit margins if sysco is unable to raise prices to its customers at the same rate its costs increase 
the foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions 
sysco s operating results are also sensitive to  and may be adversely affected by  other factors  including difficulties with the collectability of accounts receivable  inventory control  competitive price pressures  severe weather conditions and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
although these factors have not had a material adverse impact on sysco s past operations  there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect future operating results 
leverage and debt service because historically a substantial part of sysco s growth has been the result of acquisitions and capital expansion  sysco s continued growth depends  in large part  on its ability to continue this expansion 
as a result  its inability to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures through borrowed funds could restrict its ability to expand 
moreover  any default under the documents governing the indebtedness of sysco could have a significant adverse effect on the market value of sysco s common stock 
further  sysco s leveraged position may also increase its vulnerability to competitive pressures 
product liability claims sysco  like any other seller of food  faces the risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of products sold by the company causes injury or illness 
with respect to product liability claims  sysco believes it has sufficient primary or excess umbrella liability insurance 
however  this insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost  or  if available  may not be adequate to cover all of sysco s liabilities 
sysco generally seeks contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying its products  but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited  as a practical matter  to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers 
if sysco does not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available  product liability relating to defective products could materially reduce sysco s net earnings and earnings per share 
interruption of supplies sysco obtains substantially all of its foodservice products from third party suppliers 
for the most part  sysco does not have long term contracts with its suppliers committing them to provide products to sysco 
although sysco s purchasing volume can provide leverage when dealing with suppliers  suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by sysco in the quantities requested 
because sysco does not control the actual production of the products it sells  it is also subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside its control 
these conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers  weather  crop conditions  transportation interruptions  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
sysco s inability to obtain adequate supplies of its foodservice products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise  could mean that sysco could not fulfill its obligations to customers  and customers may turn to other distributors 
labor relations as of june   approximately  employees at operating companies were members of different local unions associated with the international brotherhood of teamsters and other labor organizations 
in fiscal  agreements covering approximately  employees will expire 
failure of the operating companies to effectively renegotiate these contracts could result in work stoppages 
although sysco s operating subsidiaries have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages to date  and sysco believes they have satisfactory relationships with their unions  a work stoppage due to failure of one or more operating subsidiaries to renegotiate a union contract  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on sysco 
integration of acquired companies if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner  its profitability may decrease 
integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when sysco acquires a business in a market in which it has limited or no expertise  or with a corporate culture different from sysco s 
if sysco is unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully  it may incur substantial costs and delays in increasing its customer base 
in addition  the failure to integrate acquisitions successfully may divert management s attention from sysco s existing business and may damage sysco s relationships with its key customers and suppliers 
charter and stockholder rights plan under its restated certificate of incorporation  sysco s board of directors is authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
issuance of these shares could make it more difficult for anyone to acquire sysco without approval of the board of directors  depending on the rights and preferences of the stock issued

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sysco does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
sysco s use of debt directly exposes the company to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
sysco manages its debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that goal 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions
