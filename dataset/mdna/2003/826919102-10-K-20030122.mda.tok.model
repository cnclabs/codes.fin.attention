item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement and factors affecting future operating results under item for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal had weeks and ended on december  fiscal had weeks and ended on december  fiscal had weeks and ended on december  fiscal year will have weeks with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter of the year 
overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for the communications industry 
our innovative ics can dramatically reduce the cost  size and system power requirements of the products that our customers sell to consumers 
we currently offer ics that can be incorporated into communications devices  such as wireless phones and modems  as well as cable and satellite set top boxes  residential communication gateways for cable or dsl  and optical network equipment 
customers during fiscal included agere systems  ambit  echostar  pc tel  samsung  smart link  sony  texas instruments  thomson and wavecom 
our company was founded in our business has grown rapidly since our inception  as reflected by our employee headcount  which increased to employees at the end of fiscal  from employees at the end of fiscal  at the end of fiscal  and at the end of fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also rely on third party assemblers to assemble and package these die prior to final product testing and shipping 
we offer numerous mixed signal communication ics across eight product areas 
we commenced research and development for our first ic product  the daa  in october we introduced our daa product in the first quarter of fiscal  and first received acceptance of this product for inclusion in a customer s device  which we refer to as a design win  in march the first commercial shipment of our daa product was made in april based on the success of our family of daa products  we achieved profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal in  we introduced a voice codec product  an isomodem product and our rf synthesizer product 
in  we introduced our proslic product and a clock and data recovery product suitable for sonet physical layer applications 
in  we introduced several products  including a gsm transceiver chipset  a digital subscriber line analog front end and added several new optical networking products 
in  we expanded our existing product areas by introducing the third generation silicon daa product family  aero transceiver and wideband dual proslic 
during fiscal  our wireless products were responsible for almost half of our revenues 
although we have made progress in diversifying our revenue across a variety of product areas  we expect to generally become more dependent on our wireless products for our future sales as  and to the extent  those products become more widely adopted by gsm handset manufacturers 
for a further description of our eight product areas  please see part i  item business and factors affecting future operating results products 
many of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
during fiscal  one end customer  samsung  represented of our revenues 
during fiscal  three customers  in the aggregate  represented of our revenues  including for pc tel  for agere systems and for samsung 
in fiscal  pc tel accounted for of our revenues 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these years 
two of our distributors  uniquest and edom technology  each selling products to several customers in asia  represented and of our fiscal revenues  and and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
no other distributor accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal years  or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a large percentage of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states as our products receive acceptance in international markets 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our ics can range from month to months or more 
an additional to months or more may be required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding sales  if any 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  generally is substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
our limited operating history and rapid growth across our product areas makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as pcs and wireless telephones  we expect that the demand for our products will be subject to seasonal demand resulting in increased sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year when customers place orders to meet holiday demand 
the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations revenues 
revenues are generated principally by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue upon the transfer of title  which generally occurs upon shipment to our customers 
revenues are deferred on shipments to distributors until they are resold by such distributors to end customers 
our products typically carry a one year replacement guarantee 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues was negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for our products will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
the sales of our wireless products into the highly competitive gsm handset market are expected to comprise a larger percentage of our revenue  resulting in increased downward pressure on our average selling prices for individual products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software and other intellectual property license costs  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  and allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements 
generally  we depreciate equipment over four years on a straight line basis and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the applicable lease term 
recently introduced products tend to have higher cost of revenues per unit due to initially low production volumes required by our customers and higher costs associated with new package variations 
generally  as production volumes for a product increase  unit production costs tend to decrease as our yields improve and our semiconductor fabricators  assemblers and our internal test operations achieve greater economies of scale for that product 
additionally  the cost of wafer procurement  which is a significant component of cost of goods sold  varies cyclically with overall demand for semiconductors and availability of supply from our foundries 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research and development activities and the related new product mask and wafer costs  external consulting and services costs  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
we depreciate our research and development equipment over four years and amortize our purchased software from computer aided design tool vendors over four years 
development activities include the design of new products and creation of new product masks and wafers and test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  patent litigation legal fees  other promotional and marketing expenses  and reserves for bad debt 
write offs of uncollectible accounts have been insignificant to date 
write off of in process research development 
write off of in process research development reflects the write off of in process research and development costs which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of krypton isolation  inc krypton 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization through december includes the amortization of goodwill purchased in connection with our acquisitions of krypton in august and snr in october goodwill was amortized over four to five years using the straight line method 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal and accordingly have ceased amortization of goodwill 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets reflects the charge to write down that portion of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets that are in excess of their fair market value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options and direct issuances of stock to our employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation  representing  for accounting purposes  the difference between the exercise price of option grants  or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
the deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options or shares  generally five to eight years 
the amortization of deferred stock compensation is recorded as an operating expense 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we may from time to time elect to invest in tax advantaged short term investments yielding lower nominal interest proceeds 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our long term debt and capital lease obligations 
other income expense 
other income expense reflects our share of losses in our equity investment  asic design services  inc ads and the gain on the disposal of fixed assets 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we accrue a provision benefit for federal and state income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and interest income from tax advantaged short term investments 
results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to significant growth in the volume of sales for our wireless products  including the aero transceiver and rf synthesizer  reflecting a growing number of customers adopting these products into their offerings 
we also continued to see significant growth in the sales of our wireline products  particularly the isomodem and daa  reflecting increasing demand by existing customers for these products 
during fiscal  we experienced normal decreases in the average selling prices for certain products 
however  these price decreases were offset by the significant increases in sales volumes for our products and the introduction of higher priced next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal was million  or of revenues  an increase of million  or  as compared with gross profit of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volume 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a greater portion of our sales being comprised of our lower margin wireless products which have lower average selling prices and higher material costs than our other products 
the gross margin percentage in fiscal year was also negatively impacted by start up costs associated with the rapid production ramp of our aero transceiver product 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared with research and development expense of million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expense was principally due to increased staffing and associated costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense decreased significantly due to the substantial increase in revenues in fiscal we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales volume and the timing of certain expensive items related to new product development initiatives  such as engineering mask and wafer costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million  or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million  or  as compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense was principally attributable to increased staffing and associated costs  legal fees incurred during patent litigation  sales commissions associated with our higher revenues and employee bonuses resulting from increased earnings 
we expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses  fluctuating with case activity  during fiscal year as a result of the ongoing infringement lawsuit filed against us by tdk semiconductor corporation in august we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our sales channels  marketing efforts and administrative infrastructure 
in addition  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues because of the likelihood that indirect sales distribution channels  which typically entail the payment of commissions  will account for a larger portion of our revenues in future periods and  therefore  increase our selling  general and administrative expense relative to a direct sales force performing at satisfactory levels of productivity  fluctuating usage of advertising to promote our products and  in particular  our newly introduced products  and potential significant variability in our future sales volume 
goodwill amortization 
we did not incur goodwill amortization in fiscal due to the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill amortization in fiscal was million 
in fiscal  we wrote off the majority of our goodwill balances after determining that they were permanently impaired 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of krypton and snr 
as a result of this assessment  we concluded that the value of these assets had become permanently impaired and recorded charges of million to write off related goodwill and million to reduce the carrying value of related intangible assets to their fair value 
during fiscal  we determined that the remaining goodwill of  related to krypton was impaired and wrote off the balance 
there were no other impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  as the case may be  and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options or restricted stock  which resulted in amortization expense of million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect our amortization expense to stay at roughly this same level 
interest income 
interest income in fiscal was million  as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was generally due to lower interest rates on cash and short term investments balances during the current year and our transition to tax exempt investments which bear even lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower debt and lease payable balances during the recent period 
in december we prepaid million in satisfaction of our remaining debt and lease obligations to three equipment financing institutions 
as a result  we expect to pay little to no interest expense in fiscal other income expense 
other expense in fiscal was million  which primarily reflects our share of the losses in our investment in ads 
we did not have any equity investments  and therefore no corresponding losses  in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax provision rate  excluding the impact of goodwill amortization  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and deferred stock compensation amortization  was in fiscal  as compared to our effective tax benefit rate of in fiscal such fiscal effective tax provision rate reflects our tax benefits from our estimated research and development tax credit  tax exempt interest income  and other deductions 
the effective tax benefit in fiscal was attributable to our pre tax loss as well as tax benefits from our estimated research and development tax credit  tax exempt interest income and other deductions 
for additional information regarding our provision benefit for income taxes  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues 
revenues in fiscal were million  representing a decrease of million or from revenues of million in fiscal the decrease in the dollar amount of revenues was primarily due to a decline in the sales volume of our daa family of products  reflecting the rapid deterioration in demand for personal computers 
revenues from non daa products  such as the isomodem  the proslic  the rf synthesizer and our optical networking products  accounted for approximately of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal gross profit 
cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and represented of revenues in fiscal and of revenues in fiscal  respectively 
gross profit in fiscal was million or of revenues  a decrease of million or as compared with gross profit of million or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in both the dollar amount of gross profit and gross margin percentage was primarily due to the substantial decrease in sales volume  decreased utilization of our testing capacity and higher reserves for excess inventory due to greater fluctuations in demand for our products 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal was million or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million or as compared with research and development expense of million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of research and development expense was principally due to significant increases in new product development initiatives  usage of more expensive advanced silicon cmos processes  and increased spending to develop test methodologies for new products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expense increased significantly due to the substantial decrease in sales volume in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was million or of revenues  which reflected an increase of million or as compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million or of revenues in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense was principally attributable to increased staffing  but was partially offset by a decrease in spending on patent litigation fees 
write off of in process research development 
there was no write off of in process research development in fiscal write off of in process research development in fiscal was million as a result of the acquisition of krypton 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions of krypton and snr in late fiscal in fiscal we recorded a charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill as discussed below in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions of krypton and snr 
this assessment was performed because we became aware of the following factors and circumstances the revenue streams associated with those assets had decreased significantly since their acquisition and we did not expect to have any significant or identifiable future cash flows related to those assets  we determined that further development or alternative uses of the acquired technologies were remote  and the krypton office was closed in august of and the related employees had since either ceased to work for us or been reassigned to new projects which were unrelated to the projects on which they previously worked 
as a result of this assessment  we concluded that the value of these assets had become permanently impaired and recorded charges of million to write off related goodwill and million to reduce the carrying value of related intangible assets to their fair value 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we have recorded deferred stock compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants or the issuance price of direct issuances of stock  and the deemed fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants or issuances 
we are amortizing this amount over the vesting periods of the applicable options or restricted stock  which resulted in amortization expense of million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of amortization of deferred stock compensation was due to additional deferred stock compensation for options and restricted stock issued 
interest income 
interest income in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt in fiscal other income expense 
other expense in fiscal was  as compared to other income of million in fiscal provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate  excluding the impacts of non deductible write off of in process research development  amortization of goodwill  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and deferred stock compensation  was a benefit of in fiscal  as compared to our effective tax provision rate of in fiscal the fiscal tax benefit rate was higher than the fiscal tax provision rate primarily due to the fiscal increased tax benefit from the estimated research and development tax credit in proportion to the amount of the fiscal pre tax loss 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of obligations of municipalities and agencies of the us government that have initial maturities of less than one year 
in addition  we have credit available under a bank credit facility with a revolving line of credit for borrowings and letters of credit of up to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable at the bank s prime lending rate  which was as of december  at december   a letter of credit for million related to a building lease was outstanding under the revolving line of credit and million was available for new borrowings or letters of credit 
the bank facility is secured by our accounts receivable  inventories  capital equipment and all other unsecured assets excluding intellectual property 
the line of credit prohibits the payment of cash dividends and requires the maintenance of tangible net worth and compliance with financial ratios that measure our immediate liquidity and our ongoing ability to pay back our outstanding obligations 
we believe we were in compliance with all covenants at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fiscal operating cash flows reflect our net income of million  as adjusted for non cash charges depreciation and amortization and equity investment loss of million  and a net decrease in the non cash components of our working capital of million 
the increase in operating cash flow during fiscal was principally due to net income generated by a higher volume of sales over a relatively fixed cost structure 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash generated of million in fiscal the decrease in cash flows from investing activities during fiscal was principally due to the net purchase of short term investments of million  capital expenditures of million  and investment in other assets of million 
capital expenditures increased by million from principally due to the purchase of additional semiconductor test equipment to allow us to test our wireless products for gsm mobile handsets 
we also made investments in other assets of million to acquire certain technology rights during fiscal  including a million equity investment in ads  a privately held company engaged in the development of ics for networking devices 
we anticipate capital expenditures of million for fiscal assuming the achievement by ads of certain development milestones and satisfaction of other conditions  we may be required to make an additional equity investment in ads of million in fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we will also continue to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other business or technologies that would complement our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash generated of  in fiscal the decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal was principally due to the prepayment of million to extinguish our debt and lease obligations with three institutional lenders 
the decrease was partially offset by the proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
the following is a summary of our consolidated contractual payment obligations at december  see note of the consolidated financial statements  in thousands thereafter facilities leases  net      our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash balances and credit facility are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and gross profit on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales history  backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
to address the difficult  subjective and complex area of judgment in determining appropriate inventory valuation in a consistent manner  we apply a set of methods  assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net inventory amount by completing the following first  we identify any inventory that has been previously reserved in prior periods 
this inventory remains reserved until sold  destroyed or otherwise disposed of 
second  we examine the inventory line items that may have some form of obsolescence due to non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards as identified by our quality assurance personnel and provide reserves 
third  the remaining inventory not otherwise identified to be reserved is compared to an assessment of product history and forecasted demand  typically over the last six months and next six months  or actual firm backlog on hand 
finally  an analysis of the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace driving the outlook for the consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including goodwill  fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past their contractual due date  the current business environment  and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
accounts receivable write offs to date have been immaterial 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas nos 
and  business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
replaced accounting principles board apb no 
and eliminates pooling of interests accounting 
it also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all business combinations completed after june  upon a company s adoption of sfas no 
 a company ceases to amortize goodwill recorded for business combinations consummated prior to july   and intangible assets acquired prior to july  that do not meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
are reclassified to goodwill 
companies are required to adopt sfas no 
for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on december   the beginning of fiscal in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment 
the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  however  it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset as held for sale 
we adopted sfas no 
on december   but the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
since we are continuing to account for stock based compensation according to apb  our adoption of sfas no 
requires us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of fas on reported income and will require us to disclose these affects in the interim financial statements as well 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our investments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
based on our investment holdings as of december   an immediate decline in the interest rates for such instruments would decrease our annual interest income by million 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold
