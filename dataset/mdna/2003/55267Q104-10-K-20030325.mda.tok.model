item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data set forth above and the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview revenues and expenses since its founding  the company has been engaged in the business of investing in  owning and operating second hand vessels 
as of december   the company s fleet included seven liquid petroleum gas lpg carriers  eight containerships and two multipurpose seariver vessels 
each of the company s vessels is owned by a separate wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the company generally employs its vessels on time charter  bareboat charter or spot charter 
with time charters  the company receives a fixed charterhire per on hire day and is responsible for meeting all the operating expenses of the vessels  such as crew costs  voyage expenses  insurance  repairs and maintenance 
in the case of bareboat charters  the company receives a fixed charterhire per day for the vessel and the charterer is responsible for all the costs associated with the vessel s operation during the bareboat charter period 
in the case of voyage charters  the vessel is contracted only for a voyage between two ports the company is paid for the cargo transported and pays all voyage costs 
in all chartering arrangements  both shipowner and charterer will generally employ the services of one or more brokers  who are paid a commission on the total value of the daily charterhire or a lump sum payable under the charterparty or contract 
the level of the company s revenues and expenses will vary from year to year depending on  inter alia  the number of vessels controlled by the company during each year 
cyclicality of shipping industry  fluctuating charter rates and vessel values 
the shipping industry has been highly cyclical  experiencing volatility in profitability  vessel values and charter rates resulting from changes in the supply of  and demand for  shipping capacity 
the demand for ships is influenced by  among other factors  global and regional economic conditions  developments in international trade  changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns  weather patterns  crop yields  armed conflicts  port congestion  canal closures  political developments  conflicts  embargoes and strikes 
the demand for ships is also influenced by  among other things  the demand for consumer goods and perishable foodstuffs  dry bulk commodities  crude oil and oil products 
demand for such products is affected by  among other things  general economic conditions  commodity prices  environmental concerns  weather and competition from alternatives to coal and oil 
the supply of shipping capacity is a function of the delivery of new vessels and the number of older vessels scrapped  converted to other uses  reactivated or lost 
such supply may be affected by regulation of maritime transportation practices by governmental and international authorities 
all of these factors which affect the supply of and demand for vessel capacity are beyond the control of the company 
in addition  the nature  timing and degree of change in the shipping markets in which the company operates  as well as future charter rates and values of its vessels  are not readily predictable

net income loss the net income for the year ended december  was  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  impact of inflation management believes that inflation did not have a material impact upon the company s business during the year ended december  critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a discussion of the accounting policies applied by the company that are considered to involve a higher degree of judgment in their application 
see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein for details of all of the company s material accounting policies 
the company s application of fas rules are based on judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators  which in turn are based on management estimates and assumptions regarding future market performance and future vessel operating and financial performance 
actual results could differ from these estimates and the company may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognised 
at december   the book value of the company s vessels exceeds the market value by approximately  if future events cause the company to conclude that vessels are further impaired  the resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and sources of capital the company generated cash flows from operations of  in compared to  in  on reduced revenues 
the company had  in cash available at december  as compared to  at december  a portion of the cash is restricted at december   deposits totalling  december   are pledged to guarantee the company s performance under various loan agreements 
in addition  it should be noted that  was deposited in vessels operating accounts which are directly operated by the vessel technical managers  in 
in  the company repaid net borrowings of  with cash provided by operating activities 
included in this repayment was the retirement of  of notes in exchange for consideration of  the company s long term debt including the current portion increased from  as of december  to  as of december  the increase is due to the  loan incurred to buy four container vessels in april see note long term debt 
aggregate maturities of long term debt subsequent to december  are as follows and thereafter total  in june  the company sold the built container vessel maersk tampa to a non affiliated company with the maersk charter attached 
in the event maersk does not extend the present charter at its expiry in november  the company is committed to charter the vessel back from the buyer for a period of eighteen months 
the charter rate will be  per day for twelve months and  per day for the remaining six months 
the aggregate amount of the commitment under this agreement is approximately  as follows total  these amounts do not take into consideration any revenues the company will earn from chartering the vessel to another party 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased from at december  to at december  consequent upon the acquisition of four containerships in april  the company s cash balances decreased by approximately  and the current portion of long term debt increased by  following the drawdown of the loan granted to the company by nedship bank to finance the acquisition of the vessels the cash flows from the purchased vessels are expected to be sufficient to cover the expected interest and principal repayments 
management believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and sale of some vessels will provide sufficient funds to enable the company to meet its liquidity requirements throughout  based on current levels of charter rates 
the company does not currently have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swaps the company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements  which are used to hedge the company s interest rate exposure associated with its long term debt 
at december   one swap agreement had a notional amount of  a fair market value of  in favour of the bank and an interest rate of 
it will expire in september the second swap agreement had a notional amount of  a fair market value of  in favour of the bank and an interest rate of 
it will expire in september long term debt the company is subject to interest rate risk associated with certain variable rate long term debt as described below 
at december   the company had approximately  in variable long term debt outstanding which was not hedged by interest rate swaps  corresponding to the outstanding amount of the credit facility of  granted in june to the company by fortis bank and bnp 
the facility bears interest at libor plus and matures in june for every one percent variation in interest rate  the interest expense would vary by  impact of currency fluctuations the company s functional currency is the us dollar  however  a number of transactions are performed in other currencies 
in  approximately of total revenues and approximately of total costs and expenses were denominated in currencies other than us dollars
