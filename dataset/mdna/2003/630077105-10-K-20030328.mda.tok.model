in order to raise market awareness of our products  we advertise in trade publications  distribute promotional materials  publish technical articles  conduct marketing programs  issue press releases regarding new products  work with a public relations firm and participate in industry trade shows and conferences 
technology we believe that our engineering expertise  technology acquisitions  supplier alliances and short cycle production strategies enable us to develop and offer advanced solutions that address industry trends 
by offering common metrology platforms that can be configured with a variety of measurement technologies  our customers can i specify high performance systems not offered by other suppliers or ii narrowly configure a system for a specific application as a cost saving measure 
spectroscopic reflectometry 
we pioneered the use of micro spot spectroscopic reflectometry for semiconductor film metrology in the late s 
spectroscopic reflectometry uses multiple wavelengths colors of light to obtain an array of data for analysis of film thickness and other film parameters 
today s semiconductor manufacturers still depend on spectroscopic reflectometry for most film metrology applications 
reflectometry is the measurement of reflected light 
for film metrology  a wavelength spectrum in the visible region is commonly used 
light reflected from the surfaces of the film and the substrate is analyzed using computers and measurement algorithms 
the analysis yields thickness information and other parameters without contacting or destroying the film 
in the mid s  we introduced a duv reflectometer for material analysis 
in  we were awarded a patent for the determination of absolute reflectance in the ultraviolet region 
this technology provides enhanced measurement performance for thinner films and films stacked on top of one another 
spectroscopic ellipsometry 
like reflectometry  ellipsometry is a non contact and non destructive technique used to analyze and measure films 
an ellipsometer analyzes the change in a polarized beam of light after reflection from a film s surface and interface 
our systems are spectroscopic  providing ellipsometric data at many different wavelengths 
i spectroscopic ellipsometry provides a wealth of information about a film  yielding very accurate and reliable measurements 
in general  ellipsometers are used for thin films and complex film stacks  whereas reflectometers are used for thicker films and stacks 
optical critical dimension technology 
our ocd technology is a patented critical dimension measurement technology that is used to precisely determine the dimensions on the semiconductor wafer that directly control the resulting performance of the integrated circuit devices 
this non destructive  cd measurement technology is compatible with the current micrometer manufacturing technology and is extendible below micrometer for future requirements in both photolithography and etch applications 
ocd combines non contact optical technology with extremely powerful data analysis software to provide highly accurate measurement results for line width  height and sidewall angles 
this technology is available in both standalone and integrated platforms 
overlay registration 
overlay registration refers to the relative alignment of two layers in the thin film photolithographic process 
our microscope based  measurement technology utilizes a high magnification  low distortion imaging system combined with proprietary software algorithms to numerically quantify the alignment 
optical profilometry 
we recently developed an optical profiler for the measurement of copper metal loss during the chemical mechanical planarization process 
this technology uses the combination of an optical interferometer and our reflectometer technology to accurately determine metal loss  even over multiple layers during the final steps of metallization 
our technology is a unique method for precisely and accurately controlling this process step 
broadband light scattering 
our new  broadband  white light inspection technology is used to detect and accurately locate particles and defects on the front and back sides of wafer surfaces  which could potentially lead to device failures and critical yield loss during the semiconductor manufacturing process 
the technology combines a high efficiency  broadband light source with a high resolution detection system and proprietary digital image processing for defect and contamination detection on a wide variety of films and surfaces 
this technology can be readily extended to other manufacturing processes  such as magnetic thin film heads and flat panel displays and represents a new market for us 
customer service and support we believe that customer service and technical support are important factors to distinguish us from our competitors and are essential to building and maintaining close  long term relationships with our customers 
we provide support to our customers with telephonic technical support access  direct training programs and operating manuals and other technical support information 
we use our demonstration equipment for training programs  as well as for our sales and marketing efforts

service  applications  and sales support for the european continent are provided through our operations in italy and germany 
in asia  service is provided by direct offices in japan  korea  taiwan  singapore and by a new office that we opened in in shanghai  china 
our distributors and representatives also provide service in other countries in asia 
we provide a one year warranty on parts and labor for products sold domestically and in foreign markets 
service revenue  including sales of replacement parts  represented approximately  and of total net revenues in  and  respectively 
backlog as of december  our backlog was approximately million 
as of december   our backlog was approximately million 
backlog includes orders for products that we expect to ship within months 
orders from our customers are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer without penalty 
historically  order cancellations and order rescheduling have not been significant 
however  orders presently in backlog could be canceled or rescheduled 
as only a portion of our revenues for any fiscal quarter represent systems in backlog  we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful or accurate indication of our future revenues and performance 
competition the market for our metrology systems is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology 
we compete i on a global basis with both larger and smaller companies in the united states  japan  israel and europe 
our products compete primarily with stand alone thin film measurement products from kla tencor corporation  therma wave  inc  rudolph technologies and dai nippon screen  integrated thin film measurement products from nova measuring instruments ltd 
and therma wave  and overlay measurement products from kla tencor  bio rad laboratories inc and schlumberger ltd 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
significant competitive factors in our industry include measurement technology  system performance  including automation and software capability  ease of use  reliability  established customer bases  cost of ownership  price and global customer service 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors  but we must continue to develop and design new and improved products in order to maintain our competitive position 
manufacturing we manufacture our products in the united states  japan and korea 
we combine proprietary measurement components and software produced in our facilities with components and subassemblies obtained from outside suppliers 
certain of our products include system engineering and software development to meet specific customer requirements 
our manufacturing operations do not require a major investment in capital equipment 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
we do not maintain any long term supply agreements with any of our suppliers 
we have entered into an agreement with ja woollam company for the purchase of the spectroscopic ellipsometer components 
additionally  we use newport corporation as our primary source of robotics components 
research and development our research and development is directed towards enhancing existing products and developing and introducing new products to maintain technological leadership and to meet current and evolving customer needs 
our process  engineering  marketing  operations and management personnel have developed close collaborative relationships with many of our customers counterparts and have used these relationships to identify market demands and target our research and development to meet those demands 
we are working to develop potential applications of new and emerging technologies  including improved metrology methods 
we conduct research and development at our facilities in california  korea and japan

we also have extensive experience in systems integration engineering required to design compact  highly automated systems for advanced clean room environments 
expenditures for research and development during  and were million  million and million  and represented  and of total net revenues  respectively 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on the technical innovation of our products 
we actively pursue a program of filing patent applications to seek protection of technologically sensitive features of our metrology systems 
as of december   we held united states patents with patent applications pending  of which were filed during the united states patents  issued during the period to  will expire between to while we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents and non disclosure agreements  we believe that our success will depend to a greater degree upon innovation  technological expertise and our ability to adapt our products to new technology 
we may not be able to protect our technology and competitors may be able to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
from time to time we receive communications from third parties asserting that our metrology systems may contain design features that are claimed to infringe their proprietary rights 
we typically refer such matters to our legal counsel 
employees at december   we employed approximately persons worldwide  including in research and development  in manufacturing and manufacturing support  in marketing  sales and field service and in general administration and finance 
none of these employees is represented by a union and we have never experienced a work stoppage as a result of union actions 
many of our employees have specialized skills of value to us 
our future success will depend in large part upon our i ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific  technical  managerial  financial and marketing personnel  who are in great demand in the industry

overview we are a leader in the design  manufacture  marketing and support of thin film metrology systems for the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
our systems precisely measure a wide range of film types deposited on substrates during manufacturing in order to control manufacturing processes and increase production yields 
our business our business is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors  flat panel displays and magnetic recording heads and their suppliers 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers for our products is  in turn  dependent on the current and future market demand for semiconductors and products utilizing semiconductors  disk drives and computers that utilize disk drives and flat panel displays for use in laptop computers  pagers  cell phones and a variety of other applications 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors  flat panel displays and magnetic recording heads is also an important factor in the demand for our metrology systems 
we derive our revenues from product sales and services  which include sales of accessories and service to the installed base of our products 
for the year ended december   we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
revenues from product sales and replacement and spare parts are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
revenues from service work are recognized when performed 
in certain geographical regions where risk of loss and title do not transfer upon shipment  payments received are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized upon customer acceptance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our revenue recognition policy 
current trends changing trends in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head manufacturing industries are increasing the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include o adoption of chemical mechanical planarization 
manufacturers now use cmp to flatten  or planarize  thin films to obtain the ultra flat surfaces required for advanced photolithography 
in addition  the introduction of new copper interconnect techniques has increased the need for cmp 
accordingly  semiconductor manufacturers are seeking metrology solutions that can help control the cmp process by measuring the thin film layer to determine precisely when the appropriate thickness has been achieved 
o dynamic etch time adjustment 
semiconductor manufacturers are adjusting etch time on the fly to compensate for measured variation and feedback is used to control the dose in lithography for the next wafer 
if not properly controlled  cd variations in high end microprocessors can cause some chips to run at slower speeds  affecting their ability to command premium pricing 
o adoption of new types of thin film materials 
manufacturers are adopting new processes and technologies that increase the importance and utilization of thin film metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers are utilizing copper and new  low dielectric constant low k insulating materials that require enhanced metrology solutions for the manufacturing process 
ii o increasing complexity of semiconductors 
semiconductors are becoming more complex as they operate at faster speeds with smaller feature sizes  employ larger dies that contain more transistors and utilize increasing numbers of manufacturing process steps 
the value of processed wafers and the cost of rework is significantly higher for these complex semiconductors and therefore  manufacturers are seeking to use metrology solutions to increase production yields and limit the amount of rework o need for rapid ramp of production efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on the manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
semiconductor device manufacturers are using metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
nanometrics is committed to providing customers with solutions to the problems they experience in these areas 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations  income taxes and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  warranty accrual  income tax assets and liabilities including the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  goodwill and stock based compensation due to the estimates and judgments involved with each of these items 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for product sales  this generally occurs at the time of shipment if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment 
all other product sales are recognized upon customer acceptance 
in certain geographical regions  where risk of loss and title transfers upon customer acceptance  revenue is also recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized on shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
revenue related service contracts are recognized ratably over the period under contract 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based primarily on the magnitude and age of outstanding customer invoices in general  as well as on the status of collections issues with specific customers 
customer accounts are reviewed on a continuous basis 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we track the age of our unused inventory on a monthly basis and if management determines that inventory has become obsolete or is considered to be excess inventory  it will be written down to its estimated market value 
management s determination to write down inventory is generally based on such factors as economic conditions  expected demand and obsolescence based on engineering redesigns 
warranty accrual we sell the majority of our products with a one year repair or replacement warranty and record a provision for estimated claims at the time of sale 
the warranty accrual is generally based on our historical warranty repair cost patterns  including the cost of parts and labor 
the warranty accrual is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is based on estimates of our effective income tax rate for the year 
the effective tax rate is generally estimated based on the geographic distribution of profits  the tax rates in different regions and the availability of tax credits 
if ii actual results differ from our estimates  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or to adjust our effective tax rate  which could have a material effect on our financial results 
goodwill on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon implementation of this statement  the transition impairment test was performed as of january   and no impairment loss was recorded 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we elected to test our goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of based upon the results of the annual impairment test  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of the fair value of the segment was estimated using the discounted cash flows method 
as of december   we had no goodwill on our balance sheet

net income loss ii years ended december   and total net revenues 
total net revenues decreased from million in to million in product sales decreased from million in to million in unit sales of automated  integrated and tabletop systems were each down from their levels 
the decrease in product sales resulted from reduced demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment in  particularly in the us and asia 
we believe that this reduced demand was attributable primarily to continued overcapacity and price pressures  particularly for dram products  in the semiconductor industry as well as the continued economic slowdown in the us and japan in service revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which is partly due to a larger installed base of systems that have passed their warranty periods 
total net revenues decreased from million in to million in product sales decreased from million in to million in unit sales of automated  integrated and tabletop systems were each down from their levels 
the decrease in product sales resulted from reduced demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment in  particularly in the us and asia 
we believe that this reduced demand was attributable primarily to overcapacity in the semiconductor industry as well as the economic slowdown in the us and japan in service revenue decreased from million in to million in the decrease in service revenue is primarily attributable to lower sales of parts and services in the us and asia in due in part to the decline in the semiconductor market during discussed above 
international revenues  which includes sales by our foreign subsidiaries  constituted approximately  and of total net revenues for  and  respectively 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from in to in primarily due to lower sales volumes in resulting in higher per unit manufacturing costs  along with a continued increase in manufacturing capacity added to our us facility in the increased manufacturing capacity is part of a strategic move to internalize the production of key parts and components  allowing us to have greater control over their development  delivery  quality and cost 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased from in to in primarily because of lower sales volumes in resulting in higher per unit manufacturing costs  along with increased manufacturing capacity added to our us facility in cost of service 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue decreased from in to in primarily as a result of higher service sales  which exceeded our costs of service in the u 
s and asia 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in primarily as a result of lower service sales in the u 
s and asia and the addition of service personnel in singapore 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in as a result of increased headcount and higher materials expenses used in the development of new products in  such as the nanoudi  the nanoclp  the nanoocd and other unreleased products 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in as a result of additional headcount and higher materials expenses used in the development of new products in we are committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believe that new product introductions are required for us to maintain our competitive position 
during  research and development expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to in and in selling 
selling expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to increased headcount of sales and support employees and an increase in related expenses for the purpose of promoting our products to existing and potential customers 
selling expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily because of lower sales and related expenses  including commissions  in in  selling expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to in and in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase resulted primarily from higher legal  patent  audit  tax and software related costs in general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in during  general and administrative expenses represented of total net revenues  compared to in and in ii goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon implementation of this statement  the transition impairment test was performed as of january   and no impairment loss was recorded 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
we elected to test our goodwill for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of based upon the results of the annual impairment test  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of the fair value of the segment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
total other income  net 
total other income  net decreased from million in to  in primarily due to lower interest income in  resulting from lower investment balances and lower interest rates 
total other income  net decreased from million in to million in primarily due to lower interest income in provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was a benefit of in  versus an expense of in the difference relates primarily to the results of operations for each respective period 
our effective income tax benefit rate was in  which exceeded the us statutory rate due primarily to state income tax benefits and the utilization of tax credits 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to profits earned by our japanese subsidiary that could not be offset against losses from our other subsidiaries 
the effective income tax rate in exceeded the us statutory rate due primarily to foreign tax provision higher than us rates and changes in the valuation allowance partially offset by the realization of foreign sales corporation benefit  while in  the effective rate was lower than the us statutory rate due primarily to utilization of tax credits  higher foreign sales corporation benefit and change in valuation allowance offset by higher state income tax 
cumulative effect of change in revenue recognition principle sab 
the cumulative effect of million in is the net result of recording million in net revenues  which were previously recorded in  offset by million in related costs and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at december  these funds are invested primarily in us treasury bills 
our working capital of million at december  decreased from million at december  we believe that our working capital  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our needs at least through the next twelve months 
operating activities during used cash of million primarily from the net loss and lower levels of deferred income taxes  deferred revenue as well as other current liabilities  such as accounts payable that  in part  reflected a decline in the purchase of inventory in this decrease was partially offset by the goodwill impairment write off  lower inventories supporting the lower sales level in and lower accounts receivable  resulting in part from the decline in sales during investing activities used million due primarily to net purchases of short term investments of million and million in capital expenditures used primarily to expand our manufacturing capacity in the us in financing activities provided cash of  primarily from the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans  offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations in japan 
operating activities during used cash of million primarily from increased inventory and lower other current liabilities offset partially by lower accounts receivable resulting from reduced sales levels in investing activities provided million due primarily to net sales of short term investments of million offset to some extent by million in capital expenditures used to improve our facilities and to expand our manufacturing capacity in financing activities provided cash of  primarily from the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations in japan 
operating activities during provided cash of million primarily from net income and increased accounts payable and other current liabilities offset partially by higher accounts receivable and inventory levels 
investing activities used million due to net purchases of short term investments of million and million in capital expenditures used for the purchase and improvement of our building in milpitas  california in financing activities provided cash of million primarily from a public offering of common stock in march  the issuance of debt obligations and the sale of shares under the employee stock purchase and option plans offset by the net repayment of debt obligations in japan 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
ii recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this statement eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires that goodwill be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
upon implementation of this statement  the transition impairment test for goodwill was performed as of january   and no impairment loss was recorded 
during  we recorded a charge of  for impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had no goodwill on our balance sheet at december  this statement also requires that the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets be reassessed and the remaining amortization periods be adjusted accordingly 
adoption of this statement did not require any adjustments to be made to the useful lives of existing intangible assets and no reclassifications of intangible assets to goodwill were necessary 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains its fundamental provision for recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
this statement requires that all long lived assets to be disposed of by sale be carried at the lower of carrying amount of fair value less cost to sell  and that depreciation cease to be recorded on such assets 
sfas no 
standardizes the accounting and presentation requirements for all long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  and supersedes previous guidance for discontinued operations of business segments

factors that may affect future operating results you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
ii risks related to our business cyclicality in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries has led to substantial decreases in demand for our systems and may from time to time continue to do so 
our operating results have varied significantly due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
the majority of our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor device and capital equipment manufacturers 
these manufacturers capital expenditures  in turn  depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products using semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these downturns have often resulted in substantial decreases in the demand for capital equipment  including metrology systems 
we have found that the resulting decrease in capital expenditures has typically been more pronounced than the downturn in semiconductor device industry revenues 
we expect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  and therefore  our business  to continue in the foreseeable future 
currently  the semiconductor industry is experiencing a downturn  which has existed for the past few years 
should the downturn continue or become more severe  our business and results of operations could suffer 
we are highly dependent on international sales and operations  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
sales to customers in foreign countries accounted for approximately and of our total net revenues in and  respectively 
we maintain facilities in japan and korea 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our reliance on international sales and operations exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  including o political  social and economic instability  o trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  o import and export license requirements and restrictions  o difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  o disruptions in international transport or delivery  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o difficulties in collecting receivables  and o potentially adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize  our international sales could decrease and our foreign operations could suffer 
because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales in asia  our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected by the instability of asian economies 
our sales to customers in asian markets represented approximately and of our total net revenues in and  respectively 
countries in the asia pacific region  including japan  korea and taiwan  each of which accounted for a significant portion of our business in that region  have experienced general economic weaknesses over the past year  which has adversely affected our sales to semiconductor manufacturers located in these regions and could harm our sales in future periods 
our largest customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and our revenues would significantly decline if one or more of these customers were to purchase significantly fewer of our systems or if they delayed or cancelled a large order 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and each year has been derived from sales to a relatively few number of customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
there are only a limited number of large companies operating in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries 
accordingly  we expect that we will continue to depend on a small number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
if any of our key customers were to purchase significantly fewer systems  or if a large order were delayed or cancelled  our revenues would significantly decline 
in  sales to applied materials accounted for of our total net revenues 
in  sales to applied materials accounted for of our total net revenues 
ii the success of our product development efforts depends on our ability to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of semiconductor device manufacturers 
in order to anticipate these trends and ensure that critical development projects proceed in a coordinated manner  we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers 
our relationships with our customers provide us with access to valuable information regarding industry trends  which enables us to better plan our product development activities 
if our current relationships with our large customers are impaired  or if we are unable to develop similar collaborative relationships with important customers in the future  our long term ability to produce commercially successful systems could be adversely affected 
we depend on applied materials for sales of our integrated metrology systems  and the loss of applied materials as a customer could harm our business 
we believe that sales of integrated metrology systems will be an important source of future revenues 
sales of our integrated metrology systems depend upon the ability of applied materials to sell semiconductor equipment products that include our metrology systems as components 
if applied materials is unable to sell such products  or if applied materials chooses to focus its attention on products that do not integrate our systems  our business could suffer 
we may be unable to retain applied materials as a customer 
if we lose applied materials as a customer for any reason  our ability to realize sales from integrated metrology systems would be significantly diminished  which would harm our business 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and probably will continue to vary significantly in the future  which will cause volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that may influence our operating results and subject our stock to extreme price and volume fluctuations include o changes in customer demand for our systems  o economic conditions in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries  o the timing  cancellation or delay of customer orders and shipments  o market acceptance of our products and our customers products  o competitive pressures on product prices and changes in pricing by our customers or suppliers  o the timing of new product announcements and product releases by us or our competitors and our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a timely and cost effective basis  o the timing of acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  o the levels of our fixed expenses  including research and development costs associated with product development  relative to our revenue levels  and o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the japanese yen 
if our operating results in any period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
we obtain some of the components and subassemblies included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and significant loss of revenue 
we rely on outside vendors to manufacture many components and subassemblies 
certain components  subassemblies and services necessary for the manufacture of our systems are obtained from a sole supplier or limited group of suppliers 
we do not maintain any long term supply agreements with any of our suppliers 
we have entered into arrangements with ja woollam company for the purchase of the spectroscopic ellipsometer component and newport corporation for the robotics incorporated in our advanced measurement systems 
our reliance on a sole or a limited group of suppliers involves several risks  including the following o we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of required components  o we have reduced control over pricing and the timely delivery of components and subassemblies  and ii o our suppliers may be unable to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new systems 
some of our suppliers have relatively limited financial and other resources 
because the manufacturing of certain of these components and subassemblies involves extremely complex processes and requires long lead times  we may experience delays or shortages caused by our suppliers 
if we were forced to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture such components or subassemblies internally  we could be forced to redesign our systems  which could cause production delays and prevent us from shipping our systems to customers on a timely basis 
any inability to obtain adequate deliveries from our suppliers  or any other circumstance that would restrict our ability to ship our products  could damage relationships with current and prospective customers  harm our business and result in significant loss of revenue 
our current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  and increased competition could impair sales of our products 
we operate in the highly competitive semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries and face competition from a number of companies  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or market developments by devoting greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  which could impair sales of our products 
moreover  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity among our competitors and potential competitors 
these transactions by our competitors and potential competitors may provide them with a competitive advantage over us by enabling them to rapidly expand their product offerings and service capabilities to meet a broader range of customer needs 
many of our customers and potential customers in the semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head industries are large companies that require global support and service for their metrology systems 
some of our larger or more geographically diverse competitors might be better equipped to provide this global support 
variations in the amount of time it takes for us to sell our systems may cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could adversely affect our stock price 
variations in the length of our sales cycles could cause our revenues to fluctuate widely from period to period 
our customers generally take long periods of time to evaluate our metrology systems 
we expend significant resources educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the uses and benefits of our systems 
the length of time that it takes for us to complete a sale depends upon many factors  including o the efforts of our sales force and our independent sales representatives and distributors  o the complexity of the customer s metrology needs  o the internal technical capabilities and sophistication of the customer  o the customer s budgetary constraints  and o the quality and sophistication of the customer s current processing equipment 
because of the number of factors influencing the sales process  the period between our initial contact with a customer and the time at which we recognize revenue from that customer  if at all  varies widely 
our sales cycles  including the time it takes for us to build a product to customer specifications after receiving an order  typically range from three to six months 
occasionally our sales cycles can be much longer  particularly with customers in asia who may require longer evaluation periods 
during the sales cycles  we commit substantial resources to our sales efforts in advance of receiving any revenue  and we may never receive any revenue from a customer despite our sales efforts 
if we do complete a sale  customers often purchase only one of our systems and then evaluate its performance for a lengthy period of time before purchasing additional systems 
the purchases are generally made through purchase orders rather than through long term contracts 
the number of additional products that a customer purchases  if any  depends on many factors  including a customer s capacity requirements 
the period between a customer s initial purchase and any subsequent purchases is unpredictable and can vary from three months to a year or longer 
variations in the length of this period could cause fluctuations in our operating results  which could adversely affect our stock price 
ii relatively small fluctuations in our system prices may cause our operating results to vary significantly each quarter 
during any quarter  a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our automated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system  our integrated metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system and our tabletop metrology systems range in price from approximately  to  per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number or types of systems that we sell could cause significant changes in our operating results 
we depend on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter  and therefore our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter and shipments from backlog 
our backlog at the beginning of each quarter does not include all systems sales needed to achieve expected revenues for that quarter 
consequently  we are dependent on obtaining orders for systems to be shipped in the same quarter that the order is received 
moreover  customers may reschedule shipments  and production difficulties could delay shipments 
accordingly  we have limited visibility of future product shipments  and our results of operations may be subject to significant variability from quarter to quarter 
because of the high cost of switching equipment vendors in our markets  it is sometimes difficult for us to attract customers from our competitors even if our metrology systems are superior to theirs 
we believe that once a semiconductor  flat panel display or magnetic recording head customer has selected one vendor s metrology system  the customer generally relies upon that system and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s system  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s metrology system has been installed  a customer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience downtime in order to switch to another vendor s metrology system 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales from that customer once it has selected another vendor s system for an application 
if we deliver systems with defects  our credibility will be harmed  the sales and market acceptance of our systems will decrease and we could expend significant capital and resources as a result of such defects 
our systems are complex and have occasionally contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced 
if we deliver systems with errors  defects or bugs  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our systems would be harmed 
further  if our systems contain errors  defects or bugs  we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems 
defects could also lead to product liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability arising from defects in our systems 
in the event of a successful product liability claim  we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits 
if we are not successful in developing new and enhanced metrology systems we will likely lose market share to our competitors 
we operate in an industry that is subject to technological changes  changes in customer demands and the introduction of new  higher performance systems with short product life cycles 
to be competitive  we must continually design  develop and introduce in a timely manner new metrology systems that meet the performance and price demands of semiconductor  flat panel display and magnetic recording head manufacturers and suppliers 
we must also continue to refine our current systems so that they remain competitive 
we may experience difficulties or delays in our development efforts with respect to new systems  and we may not ultimately be successful in developing them 
any significant delay in releasing new systems could adversely affect our reputation  give a competitor a first to market advantage or cause a competitor to achieve greater market share 
lack of market acceptance for our new products may affect our ability to generate revenue and may harm our business 
we have recently introduced new products to market and cannot accurately predict their future level of acceptance by our customers 
as a result  we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue from these products 
we have only recently started selling macro defect inspection products  millimeter technology platform products  wireless nanonet technology and wafer stress management products 
while we anticipate that these products will become an increasingly larger component of our ii business  their failure to gain acceptance with our customers could materially harm our business 
additionally  if our new products do gain market acceptance  our ability to sell our existing products may be impeded 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the introduction of these products will be commercially successful or that these products will result in significant additional revenues or improved operating margins in future periods 
successful infringement claims by third parties could result in substantial damages  lost product sales and the loss of important intellectual property rights by us 
our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties 
from time to time we may receive communications from third parties asserting that our metrology systems may contain design features  that are claimed to infringe on their proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that our new or current products do not infringe any valid intellectual property rights 
our intellectual property may be infringed upon by third parties despite our efforts to protect it  which could threaten our future success and competitive position and adversely affect our operating results 
our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families  and we rely  in part  on patent  trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we own or have licensed a number of patents relating to our metrology systems  and have filed applications for additional patents 
any of our pending patent applications may be rejected  and we may not in the future be able to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable 
in addition  the patents we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties 
third parties may also design around these patents 
in addition to patent protection  we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology 
we routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees 
however  in the event that these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies 
our confidential and proprietary information and technology might also be independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties 
we may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us  or to determine the scope or validity of a third party s patent or other proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re engineer our product or obtain expensive licenses from third parties  any of which would adversely affect our business and operating results 
we must expend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new products  and if these products do not achieve commercial acceptance  our operating results may suffer 
we expect to spend a significant amount of time and resources to develop new systems and refine existing systems 
in light of the long product development cycles inherent in our industry  these expenditures will be made well in advance of the prospect of deriving revenue from the sale of new systems 
our ability to commercially introduce and successfully market new systems is subject to a wide variety of challenges during this development cycle that could delay introduction of these systems 
in addition  since our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our systems  our anticipated product orders may not materialize  or orders that do materialize may be cancelled 
as a result  if we do not achieve market acceptance of new products  our operating results may suffer 
we must attract and retain key personnel with relevant industry knowledge to help support our future growth 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  customer support  finance and manufacturing personnel 
we do not enter into employment contracts with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of these key personnel  who would be difficult to replace  could harm our business and operating results 
to support our future growth  we will need to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
competition for such personnel in our industry is ongoing  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees 
ii we manufacture all of our systems at a limited number of facilities  and any prolonged disruption in the operations of those facilities could reduce our revenues 
we produce all of our systems in our manufacturing facilities located in milpitas  california and through our subsidiaries in japan and korea 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and require sophisticated  costly equipment and specially designed facilities 
as a result  any prolonged disruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities could seriously harm our ability to satisfy our customer order deadlines 
a significant portion of our operations are located in japan and korea  which may be subject to regional political and economic instability 
if we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired business in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
to achieve this  from time to time we have acquired complementary businesses  products  or technologies instead of developing them ourselves and may choose to do so in the future 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions  or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably or retain its key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology that we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of an equity financing  that result in dilution to our shareholders 
if we are unable to integrate any acquired entities  products or technologies effectively  our business will suffer 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
in and  and  respectively  of our total net revenues were derived from sales to customers in foreign countries  including certain countries in asia  such as taiwan  korea and japan 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in such countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in those countries 
continuing economic and political instability could affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing threat of terrorism targeted at the united states or other regions where we conduct business increases the uncertainty in our markets and the economy in general 
this uncertainty is likely to result in continued economic stagnation  which would harm our business 
in addition  increased international political instability may hinder our ability to do business by increasing our costs of operations 
for example  our transportation costs  insurance costs and sales efforts may become more expensive as a result of geopolitical tension 
these tensions may also negatively affect our suppliers and customers 
if this international economic and political instability continues or increases  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
instead  we actively manage the balances of current assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to minimize currency fluctuation risk 
as a result  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates at december  and would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the short term nature of these investments  interest rate changes would not have a material impact on their value at december  and we also have fixed rate yen denominated debt obligations in japan that have no interest rate risk 
at december  and  our total debt obligation was million and million  respectively  with a long term portion of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change in interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on our results of operations
