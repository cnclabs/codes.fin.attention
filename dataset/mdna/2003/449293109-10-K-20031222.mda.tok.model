item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results in operations introduction the company s revenues are primarily derived from product sales and toll services in the polymers processing industry 
product sales entail the company purchasing resin which is further processed within the company s operating facilities 
the further processing of the material may involve size reduction services and or compounding services 
compounding services include the manufacture and sale of concentrates 
after processing  the company sells the finished products to customers 
toll services involve both size reduction and compounding services whereby these services are performed on customer owned material 
service revenues are recognized as the services are performed and  in the case of product sales  revenue s are recognized when the title of the product passes to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
cost of sales and services is primarily comprised of purchased raw materials  compensation and benefits to non administrative employees  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance  electricity and equipment costs and supplies 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to the sales and marketing  executive management  information technology  accounting  legal  human resources and other administrative employees of the company  other sales and marketing expenses  communications costs  systems costs  insurance costs and legal and accounting professional fees 
demand for the company s products and services tends to be driven by overall economic factors and  particularly  consumer spending 
the trend of applicable resin prices also impacts customer demand 
as resin prices are falling  customers tend to reduce their inventories and  therefore  reduce their need for the company s products and services 
conversely  as resin prices are rising  customers often increase their inventories and accelerate their purchases of products and services from the company 
additionally  demand for the company s products and services tends to be seasonal  with customer demand being weakest during the company s first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and also due to property taxe s levied in the us on customers inventories on december the company s fourth fiscal quarter also tends to be softer compared to the company s second and third fiscal quarters  in terms of customer demand  due to vacation periods in the company s european markets 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to employee benefit liabilities  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  workers compensation  inventor y reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable  and commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable 
revenue and related cost recognition the company recognizes revenue from services upon completion of the services and related expenses are recognized as incurred 
for product sales  revenues and related expenses are recognized when ownership is transferred  which generally occurs when the products are shipped 
impairment of property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review includes comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets with the associated assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which established standards for reporting acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement accounts for goodwill based on the reporting units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level  rather than being amortized  and the amortization period of intangibl e assets with finite lives is no longer limited to forty years 
currency translation amounts in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars 
when local functional currency is translated to us dollars  the effects are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss 
exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in earnings 
stock options effective october   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after october  the company adopted the prospective method to implement sfas under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas awards under the company s plans vest over periods ranging from immediate vesting to five years 
overview in  the company incurred a net loss of  including the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  net of income taxes 
our operating loss of  was the fourth operating loss we have suffered in the last five years 
among the challenges we faced in were higher resin prices  lower tolling services volumes in a weak economic climate in north america and europe  and competitive pressures that prevented the full recovery of raw material cost increases 
while we anticipate that our fourth quarter cost reductions should begin to show results in  we still expect to incur a net loss in however  absent adverse factors outside our control such as those described in forward looking statements and risk factors  we believe that our liquidity an d access to cash will be sufficient to fund our current operations and commitments through we believe that the north american and european economic environment must improve for us to continue to operate at our current size and expense level for the long term 
if the economic environment does not improve  we may find it necessary to further downsize our administrative costs and or our operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following are considered by management as key measures of liquidity applicable to the company cash and cash equivalents working capital cash and cash equivalents decreased  and working capital decreased  during fiscal due to the factors described below 
for fiscal  cash used for operating activities by continuing operations was  compared to cash used of  for fiscal this change occurred due to a net decrease in the company s loss from continuing operations net of non cash adjustments offset by a use of cash in various working capital accounts 
capital expenditures totaled  during fiscal these expenditures were made primarily to expand the company s operating capacity 
the company anticipates that available cash and existing and future credit facilities will be sufficient to fund fiscal capital expenditure requirements 
the company received  and  net of transaction costs and cash disposed on the sale of its oilfield services business in fiscal years and  respectively 
cash used for financing activities for continuing operations was  during fiscal  compared to cash used of  during fiscal the change was primarily the result of the company s purchase during the first quarter of fiscal of  principal amount of its senior notes due a summary of future payments owed for contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  are shown in the table below total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations commercial commitments credit facilities total contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s foreign credit facilities are generally collateralized by assets owned by subsidiaries of the company and also carry various financial covenants

total credit availability net of outstanding borrowings  letters of credit and applicable foreign currency contracts totaled approximately  and  at september  and  respectively 
the company anticipates that existing cash balances  together with the borrowing capacity will provide adequate liquidity for fiscal there can  however  be no assurance the company will be successful in obtaining sources of capital that will be sufficient to support the company s capital requirements in the long term 
in connection with the company s november repurchase of  principal amount of the company s outstanding senior notes  the terms of the senior notes indenture were amended significantly 
the amended senior notes indenture contains a number of covenants including restrictions on the sale of assets of the company in excess of  and a change of control provision that requires the company to repurchase all of the senior notes at a repurchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control

if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the company s indebtedness subjects it to restrictive covenants and may limit its ability to borrow additional funds and efficiently operate the business 
the indebtedness represented by the senior notes due in has several important implications for the company  including  but not limited to  the following i a portion of the company s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to service the company s indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  ii the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions or for other purposes may be restricted  iii the indenture relating to the senior notes contains  and future agreements relating to the company s indebtedness may contain  certain restrictive covenants  including  among other things  limitations on the ability of the company to merge or consolidate with another entity failure to comply with these provisions may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on the company  and iv the ability of the company to satisfy its obligations pursuant to such indebtedness will be dependent upon the company s future performance which  in turn  will be subject to general economic conditions and management  financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting the business and operations of the company  some of which are not in the company s control 
to the extent that the company is unable to repay the principal amount of the notes out of cash on hand  it may i seek to repay the notes with the proceeds of an equity offering  ii seek refinancing  or iii sell significant assets 
there can be no assurance that any of the forgoing alternatives will be available to the company at all or on terms that are favorable to the company 
if the company cannot satisfy its obligations related to such indebtedness  substantially all o f the company s long term debt could be in default and could be declared immediately due and payable which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
changes in economic activity and in the costs of raw materials could adversely affect the company 
the company s business cycles are affected by changes in the level of economic activity in the various regions in which the company operates and changes in the cost of the polymers ie resins produced by the major chemical companies 
these costs are outside of the company s control and the business cycles are generally volatile and relatively unpredictable 
in addition  the company is affected by cycles in the petroleum and oil and gas industries 
the company s success is partly dependent on the company s ability to develop superior proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets 
the operations of the company s business are dependent to a certain degree upon proprietary technology  know how and trade secrets either developed by the company or licensed to it by third parties 
in many cases  these or equivalent processes or technologies are available to the company s competitors  customers and others 
in addition  there can be no assurance that such persons will not develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary processes and technologies 
the availability to  or development by others of equivalent or superior information  processes or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company could be materially adversely affected by a failure to properly identify  finance and integrate acquisitions 
over the past several years  the company has made business acquisitions  and other businesses may be acquired in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates and their owners  or that the company will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company at all  or without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
there can be no assurance that businesses acquired will achieve sales and profitability that justify the investment made by the company 
any inability on the part of the company to control these risks effectively and integrate and manage acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the comp any may  to the extent allowed by agreements  incur indebtedness to finance future acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any such financing or that  if available  such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense  increased interest expense  increased financial leverage or decreased operating income  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
the company has also made significant dispositions  including the sale of all of the company s oilfield services business in and  and the company may dispose of additional assets or businesses in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in investing or spending any capital obtained in connection with any such disposition  or that the company s remaining assets will perform as expected after any such disposition 
the failure to properly manage inventories could expose the company to material financial losses 
the company s product sales business  including the company s concentrate manufacturing operations require the company to buy inventories of supplies and products and to manage the risk of ownership of commodity inventories having fluctuating market values 
the maintenance of excessive inventories in these businesses could expose the company to losses from drops in market prices for its products while maintenance of insufficient inventories may result in lost sales to the company 
international events may hurt the company s operations 
a majority of the company s current operations is conducted in international markets  particularly the company s european  south american and pacific region specialty polymers processing services business 
the company expects to continue to seek to expand its international operations  primarily through internal growth 
the company s international operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties normally associated with international operations  including among others  risks of government policies regarding private property  taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions and currency fluctuations and other restrictions arising out of foreign governmental sovereignty over areas in which the company conducts business that may limit or disrupt m arkets  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights  and  possibly  civil disturbance or other forms of conflict 
losses from the factors above could be material in those countries where the company now has or may in the future have a concentration of assets 
the company continues to experience significant losses and may never be profitable  which could result in a decline in the value of its common stock and a loss of your investment 
the company sustained net losses of  and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the company s operating loss of  was the fourth operating loss it has suffered in the last five years 
the company expects to incur a net loss during fiscal year  and it cannot guarantee that it will achieve profitability in the future 
due to the company s lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in its business could materially adversely impact the company s operations 
since the company s disposition of its oilfield services operations  it relies exclusively on the revenues generated from the manufacturing of resins and concentrates and provision of specialized polymers processing services 
due to its lack of asset diversification  an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets 
if the company s common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  you may have greater difficulty disposing of your shares  the company s stock price may decline  and the company may find it more difficult to raise additional capital 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company s stock price traded below for consecutive days  and nasdaq informed the company that its common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq national market unless the closing bid price of the common stock equaled or exceeded per share for at least ten consecutive trading days prior to april  the closing bid of the company s stock price has since exceeded per share for well in excess of ten consecutive trading days  and it has been notified by nasdaq that the company is once again in compliance with its minimum bid price requirements for the nasdaq national market 
however  the company s stock price has been volatile in recent years  and may again fail to me et nasdaq s minimum bid price requirements for an extended period 
if the company s common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market  it may not be able to list the stock on the nasdaq smallcap market or any other exchange or automated trading system 
in such event  you may find it more difficult to obtain accurate quotations of the market value of the company s common stock and to dispose of shares of the company s common stock in the secondary market 
some of the institutional holders of the company s common stock may be required  under their internal investment parameters  to divest themselves of company securities  and this may have the effect of lowering the trading price of the company s common stock 
also  the delisting of the company s common stock from the nasdaq national market could also impair the company s future ability to raise capital 
operational risks such as personal injury  property damages  pollution and environmental damages could adversely affect the company s business 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge and careful evaluation  may not be overcome
