item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the following discussion and analysis should be read with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of you can identify forward looking statements by those that are not historical in nature  particularly those that use terminology such as may  will  should  could  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  project  predict  intend  potential  continue or the negative of these or similar terms 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially depending on a variety of factors including those set forth above in part i  item under the heading titled certain risk factors 
overview and critical accounting policies we are the leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality  adjustable firmness beds 
the air chamber technology of our proprietary sleep number bed allows adjustable firmness on each side of the mattress and provides a sleep surface that is clinically proven to provide better sleep quality and greater relief of back pain compared to traditional mattress products 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  accrued sales returns  accrued warranty costs and impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of by us 
the effect of these policies on our financial statements is incorporated in the discussion below 
net sales we generate revenue by selling our products through four complementary distribution channels 
three of these channels  retail  direct marketing and e commerce  are company controlled and sell directly to consumers 
our wholesale channel sells to leading home furnishings retailers  specialty bedding retailers and the qvc shopping channel 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue at the time product is shipped to our customer  except when beds are delivered and set up by our home delivery employees  in which case revenue is recorded at the time the bed is delivered and set up in the home 
accrued sales returns 
we reduce sales at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns 
this estimate is based on historical return rates  which are reasonably consistent from period to period 
if actual returns vary from expected rates  revenue in future periods is adjusted  which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
channel sales 
the proportion of our total net sales  by dollar volume  from each of our channels during the last three years is summarized as follows retail direct marketing e commerce wholesale the number of company operated retail locations during the last three years is summarized as follows beginning of year opened closed end of year we anticipate opening to new retail stores and expect to close approximately five stores in company operated stores included leased departments within  and bed  bath beyond stores as of  and  respectively 
comparable store sales increased decreased by  and in  and  respectively 
in  total net sales and comparable store sales were positively affected by the increased investment in advertising and improved product mix that resulted from improvements in our product line  the design of our promotional programs and improvements in our selling process 
cost of sales cost of sales includes costs associated with purchasing materials  manufacturing costs and delivering our products to our customers 
in  we elected to reclassify costs associated with the delivery of our products to customers from sales and marketing expenses to cost of sales 
as a result of this change  cost of sales increased and sales and marketing expenses decreased 
this change in classification does not affect operating income or net income 
accrued warranty costs 
cost of sales also includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of customers 
this estimate is based on historical claim rates during the warranty period 
because this estimate covers an extended period of time  a revision of estimated claim rates could result in a significant adjustment of estimated future costs of fulfilling warranty commitments 
an increase in estimated claim rates could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
gross profit our gross profit margin is dependent on a number of factors and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these factors include the mix of products sold  the level at which we offer promotional discounts to purchase our products  the cost of materials and manufacturing and the mix of sales between wholesale and company controlled distribution channels 
sales directly to consumers through company controlled channels generally generate higher gross margins than sales through our wholesale channels because we capture both the manufacturer s and retailer s margin 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include advertising and media production  other marketing and selling materials such as brochures  videos  customer mailings and in store signage  sales compensation  store occupancy costs and customer service 
in  we elected to reclassify costs associated with the delivery of our products to customers from sales and marketing expenses to cost of sales 
as a result of this change  cost of sales increased and sales and marketing expenses decreased 
this change in classification does not affect operating income or net income 
store opening costs are expensed as incurred and advertising costs are expensed the first time the advertisement is aired 
advertising expense was million in  million in and million in future advertising expenditures will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of the advertising in creating awareness of our products and brand name  generating consumer inquiries and driving consumer traffic to our points of sale 
we anticipate that full year advertising expenditures in will approximate million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with management of functional areas  including information technology  investor relations  risk management and research and development 
costs include salary  bonus and benefits  information hardware  software and maintenance  office facilities  insurance and shareholder relations costs and other overhead 
store closing and asset impairment expenses we evaluate our long lived assets  including leaseholds and fixtures in existing stores and stores expected to be remodeled  based on expected cash flows through the remainder of the lease term after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements and marketing programs 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
store assets are written off when we believe these costs will not be recovered through future operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as percentages of net sales 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative store closings and asset impairments total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and extraordinary loss income tax benefit expense income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss  net of tax net income loss quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing  amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures  any changes in sales return rates or warranty experience  the timing of new store openings and related expenses  net sales contributed by new stores  competitive factors  any disruptions in supplies or third party service providers and general economic conditions and consumer confidence 
furthermore  a substantial portion of net sales is often realized in the last month of a quarter  due in part to our promotional schedule and commission structure 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner  and our business  financial condition and operating results may be significantly harmed 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future period 
comparison of and net sales net sales in increased to million from million in due to a increase in mattress unit sales and higher average selling prices resulting primarily from improvements in product mix and lower return rates 
the increase in net sales by sales channel was attributable to i a million increase in sales from company controlled retail stores  including an increase in comparable store sales of million  ii a million increase in direct marketing sales  iii a million increase in sales from our wholesale channel and iv a million increase in sales from our e commerce channel 
gross profit gross profit margin increased to in from in primarily due to improved product sales mix  savings in processing returned product  reduced product delivery costs  reduced warranty claim rates resulting from improved product quality and greater manufacturing leverage 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in increased to million from million in  but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the million increase was primarily due to additional media investments  sales based compensation and retail occupancy costs 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was attributable to greater leverage in fixed selling expenses and lower cost promotional offerings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased to million in from million in of the increase  million was due to additional incentive compensation costs resulting from our improved performance  with the remaining increase primarily resulting from an increased investment in information technology 
we expect g a growth rates to be lower in the future due to planned lower incentive compensation costs 
store closing and asset impairment expenses store closing and asset impairment expenses in were million compared to million in in  the entire amount represented impairments related to store closures 
in  the expenses included million related to store closures and million related primarily to the write off of unusable fixtures for the merchandising of our sleeper sofa products 
other income expense  net other expense decreased million to approximately million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest income from our improved cash position  partially offset by increased interest expense associated with our senior secured debt 
this debt was paid off in december income tax benefit expense income tax benefit was million in as compared to zero in the million income tax benefit for was the result of recording a non recurring  non operating  non cash addition to earnings due to the expected realization of tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we expect to begin recording income tax expense at an estimated rate of during comparison of and net sales net sales in decreased to million from million in due primarily to a decrease in mattress unit sales and lower average selling prices 
the average selling price per mattress set declined slightly as a result of lower selling prices for products sold to qvc and wholesale customers  slightly offset by higher average selling prices in our company controlled distribution channels 
the change in net sales was attributable to i an million decrease in sales from company controlled retail stores  including a decrease in comparable store sales of million  ii an million decrease in direct marketing sales  iii a million increase in sales from our wholesale channel and iv a million increase in sales from our e commerce channel

sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in decreased to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the million decrease in expenses and the decrease as a percentage of net sales were primarily due to reductions in promotional and fulfillment materials  reduced sales support staffing and lower retail occupancy costs  partially offset by increases in media production expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the million decrease was primarily due to staffing reductions and reduced occupancy expense resulting from the consolidation of our two corporate offices

income loss before extraordinary loss extraordinary loss  net of tax net income loss sales are subject to some seasonal influences  with lower sales in the second quarter and higher sales during the fourth quarter holiday season due to increased mall traffic 
pro forma diluted net income loss per share reflects the effects on net income from specific non recurring items and from the recognition of an income tax benefit provision for years where a regular tax provision  at a rate of  was not recorded 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap did not allow us to reduce net income for income tax expense in or to provide an income tax benefit in because we expect to record income tax expense in future periods  we believe pro forma diluted net income loss per share provides a more meaningful comparison than gaap net income loss per share for the periods presented and for future periods 
in addition  we excluded the effect of the extraordinary after tax  non cash charges associated with early repayment of our million of senior secured debt in december a reconciliation of diluted net income loss per share as determined in accordance with gaap to pro forma diluted net income loss per share is as follows quarter quarter dec

historically  our primary source of capital has been from external sources  most recently from the completion of our million convertible debt offering in june and our million senior secured term debt financing in september the million in convertible debt was converted to equity in the second quarter of and the million of senior debt was prepaid in december with cash generated from operations 
in february  our board of directors approved an expanded share repurchase program of up to million 
we are currently pursuing a new bank revolving line of credit 
while it is not currently anticipated that this line will be necessary for short or long term liquidity needs  the line would provide additional cash flexibility 
barring any unexpected significant external or internal developments  we expect current cash balances on hand and free cash flow generated from operations to be sufficient to meet our short term and long term liquidity needs 
net cash provided by used in operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accrued compensation and benefits  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses 
the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from improved company performance  which were paid in early prepaid expenses increased in primarily due to the timing of payments related to marketing and advertising expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of a decrease in inventories and prepaid expenses  partially offset by the net loss adjusted for non cash expenses and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued sales returns 
inventory levels were reduced in as a result of two primary activities i the closure of one of our manufacturing plants and ii a focus on reducing supplier lead times  resulting in lower in stock raw material levels required at our manufacturing plants 
prepaid expenses were reduced in as a result of lower prepaid advertising levels  consistent with the timing and form of media placements at the end of versus those in place at the end of the decrease in accounts payable in was due primarily to a decrease in the number of stores open at the end of and to extended payment terms being in place with some of our key suppliers at the end of the terms with those key suppliers had normalized at the end of the balance in our accrued sales returns in decreased as a result of the change in our sales return policy from days at the end of to days at the end of the shorter return period resulted in a smaller balance of sales that had not yet been returned at the end of net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the net loss adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts receivable at the end of was primarily due to the timing of credit card settlements 
payables increased at the end of due to additional retail stores being open as of year end and extended payment terms with suppliers 
net cash provided by used in investing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
investing activities consisted of purchases of property and equipment related to investment in information technology and the opening of new retail stores in all periods 
in  we made investments of million in marketable securities and had million of marketable securities mature 
in and we liquidated million and million  respectively  of marketable securities to support our continuing operations 
in  we expect to open to new retail stores and to remodel approximately stores 
our anticipated capital investment related to our new stores and remodeling is expected to be approximately million 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in we expect our new stores to be cash flow positive within the first months of operation  and as a result  are not expected to have a significant negative effect on net cash provided by operations 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in resulted primarily from the repayment of our million of senior secured debt 
the total cash used in financing activities in was partially offset by cash received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of options and warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from the issuance of common stock and from the financing of million of convertible debt and million of senior secured term debt 
fees and expenses of million were netted against the proceeds from debt issuances 
net cash provided by financing activities in resulted from cash received from the issuance of common stock 
our liquidity is impacted by minimum cash payment commitments resulting from long term debt outstanding and operating leases 
the table below outlines those minimum cash commitments  during the periods indicated in thousands payments due by period total year years years years long term debt   operating leases      total      in addition  we have secured a million stand by letter of credit with cash 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  of which  will expire between and and the remainder will expire between and we have recorded a valuation allowance of  for capital loss carryforwards that are not likely to be utilized within the applicable carryforward periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our debt obligations consist of a million non interest bearing subordinated convertible debenture 
as a result  we do not believe we have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
other financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments 
the counterparties to the agreements consist of government agencies and various major corporations of investment grade credit standing 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties because we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and any one type of investment
