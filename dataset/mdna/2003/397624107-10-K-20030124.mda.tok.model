as of october   we owned approximately  acres of timberland in the southeastern united states and approximately  acres of timberland in canada 
our timber management is focused on the active harvesting and regeneration of our timber properties to achieve sustainable long term yields on our timberland 
while timber sales are subject to fluctuations  we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule  within the limits of market and weather conditions 
van leer industrial packaging acquisition in march  we acquired royal packaging industries van leer nv  a dutch company  huhtamaki holdings do brasil ltda  a brazilian company  van leer france holding sas  a french company  van leer containers  inc  a sas company  and american flange manufacturing co  inc  a us company  which are collectively referred to as van leer industrial packaging 
we acquired van leer industrial packaging for million less the amount of certain of its debt and other obligations million that were assumed by us as of the closing date 
van leer industrial packaging was a worldwide provider of industrial packaging and components  including steel  fibre and plastic drums  polycarbonate water bottles  ibcs and closure systems for industrial shipping containers 
in connection with the van leer industrial packaging acquisition  we acquired a interest in socer embalagens  lda 
and a interest in balmer lawrie van leer 
socer embalagens reconditions used drums at its facility in portugal and resells them to customers 
balmer lawrie van leer manufactures closure systems for industrial shipping containers at its two facilities in india 
the results of the operations of van leer industrial packaging are included in the consolidated financial statements for eight months of and for the entire year in  but are not included in the consolidated financial statements for or for the first four months of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements  in accordance with these principles  require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that the consistent application of these policies enables us to provide readers of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
the following are the accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for bad debts based on the length of time receivables are past due with allowance percentages  based on our historical experiences  applied on a graduated scale relative to the age of the receivable amounts 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected bad debt experience or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory reserves reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
we continuously evaluate the adequacy of these reserves and make adjustments to these reserves as required 
net assets held for sale net assets held for sale represent land  buildings and land improvements less accumulated depreciation for locations that have been closed  primarily as a result of the consolidation plans in the industrial packaging services segment 
we record net assets held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value is based on the estimated proceeds from the sale of the facility utilizing recent buy offers  market comparables and or data obtained from our commercial real estate broker 
our estimate as to fair value is regularly reviewed and subject to changes in the commercial real estate markets and our continuing evaluation as to the facility s acceptable sale price 
properties  plants and equipment depreciation on properties  plants and equipment is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets 
depletion on timber properties is computed on the basis of cost and the estimated recoverable timber acquired 
we believe that the lives and methods of determining depreciation and depletion are reasonable  however  using other lives and methods could provide materially different results 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring liabilities restructuring liabilities are determined in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance  including emerging issues task force eitf no 
 eitf no 
and staff accounting bulletin no 
 depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
restructuring liabilities recorded in connection with existing and acquired companies are further discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit expenses are determined by our actuaries using assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase and health care cost trend rates 
further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans and related assumptions is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the actual results would be different using other assumptions 
income taxes our effective tax rate  taxes payable and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect current tax rates in our domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions and our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of ongoing and potential future tax audits 
valuation allowances are established where expected future taxable income does not support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
environmental cleanup costs we expense environmental expenditures related to existing conditions caused by past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernable 
our estimates of environmental remediation costs are based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the results of environmental studies and testing  and considering existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites 
expenditures that extend the life of the related property  or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized 
we determine our liability on a site by site basis and record a liability at the time when it is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our estimated liability is reduced to reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of the relevant costs 
our potential future obligations for environmental contingencies related to facilities acquired in the van leer industrial packaging acquisition may  under certain circumstances  be reduced by insurance coverage and seller cost sharing provisions 
the insurance policy  which has a year term  insures for environmental contingencies unidentified at the acquisition date subject to a million aggregate self insured retention 
unidentified environmental contingencies at the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquisition date up to million are shared by the seller and by us if they are identified within years following the acquisition date 
identified environmental contingencies at the acquisition date are first provided for by us up to an aggregate million and shared on a basis by us and the seller  respectively  thereafter 
actual costs to be incurred in future periods at the identified sites may vary from the estimates  given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
future information and developments will require us to continually reassess the expected impact of these environmental matters 
contingencies various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us  including those pertaining to environmental  product liability  safety and health matters 
we are continually consulting legal counsel and evaluating requirements to reserve for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
while the amounts claimed may be substantial  the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist 
based on the facts currently available  we believe the disposition of matters that are pending will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over or years based on consideration regarding the age of the acquired companies  their customers and the risk of obsolescence of their products 
the costs of acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of to years 
our policy is to periodically review goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets based upon the evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant adverse event or change in the environment in which the business operates  or if the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest would become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be periodically reviewed for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as such  we will adopt sfas no 
at the beginning of our fiscal year 
we anticipate that the application of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
will increase our net income upon adoption 
amortization expense related to our goodwill and indefinite lived item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assets was million and million for the fiscal years ended october  and  respectively 
at this time  the effect of the impairment provisions provided by sfas no 
is not known 
other items that could have a significant impact on the financial statements include the risks and uncertainties listed in this annual report under the safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of below 
actual results could differ materially using different estimates and assumptions  or if conditions are significantly different in the future 
results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors 
our year to year comparisons have been significantly affected by our acquisition of van leer industrial packaging in march we define ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries  equity in earnings of affiliates  debt extinguishment charge and foreign currency effects 
ebitda is included in this section because it is a basis on which we assess our financial performance and debt service capabilities 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for cash flow from operations  net income or other measures of performance as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or as a measure of our company s profitability or liquidity 
while ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table sets forth the net sales and ebitda for each of our business segments for  and dollars in millions for the years ended october  net sales industrial packaging services paper  packaging services timber total net sales ebitda industrial packaging services paper  packaging services timber total segment restructuring charge corporate and other total ebitda depreciation  depletion and amortization expense debt extinguishment charge interest expense  net foreign currency effects income before income taxes  minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries and equity in earnings of affiliates fiscal year compared to fiscal year overview net sales increased to  million  an increase of  in from  million in this increase resulted from a million increase in net sales from outside north america  partially offset by a million decrease in net sales from the north american operations 
the decrease in the north american operations was due to lower net sales in the paper  packaging services segment million decrease  which were partially offset by the industrial packaging services segment million increase and the timber segment million increase 
the higher net sales in the north american operations of the industrial packaging services segment  as well as the higher net sales outside north america  were primarily due to the inclusion of van leer industrial packaging sales volume for all of compared to eight months in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ebitda was million  before the million fourth quarter restructuring charge  for as compared to million  before the million second quarter restructuring charge  for the million decrease in ebitda was attributable to lower gains on the sale of timberland million decrease and the paper  packaging services segment million decrease  which were partially offset by the inclusion of the van leer industrial packaging operations and higher timber sales 
segment review industrial packaging services the industrial packaging services segment had an increase in net sales of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in net sales outside north america and an increase of million in net sales in north america due to additional sales volume from the inclusion of an entire year of the van leer industrial packaging operating results in compared to eight months in in addition  increased pricing for this segment s products in response to higher raw material costs  especially for steel and resin during  contributed to the increase in net sales 
net sales outside of north america also benefited from an improvement in currency exchange rates in europe  which were offset by lower net sales in south america  in particular argentina and venezuela  and africa caused by unstable economic conditions and currency devaluations 
finally  sales volumes in north america were lower due to the weak economic conditions that prevailed throughout ebitda for industrial packaging services increased to million  before the million fourth quarter restructuring charge  for as compared to million  before the million second quarter restructuring charge  for the primary reasons for this increase relate to improved sales volumes as a result of the van leer industrial packaging acquisition  lower raw material costs as a percentage of net sales  positive contributions from the prior year consolidation plan and other cost savings initiatives 
paper  packaging services the paper  packaging services segment had a decrease in net sales of million  or  in as compared to this decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices for linerboard and medium of approximately  partially offset by an improvement in sales volumes on most of the segment s products 
however  our multiwall bag operations had reduced sales volumes resulting primarily from weaknesses in the agricultural industry  particularly in the midwestern united states 
ebitda for the paper  packaging services segment decreased to million for as compared to million for the decline was item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued caused by lower net sales and higher raw material costs  especially for old corrugated containers occ  on a quarter over quarter comparison 
timber the timber segment had an increase in net sales of million  or  for as compared to while timber sales are subject to fluctuations  we seek to maintain a consistent cutting schedule  within the limits of market and weather conditions 
the sales of timber are recorded as net sales  while timberland sales are included in gain on sale of timberland 
the gain on sale of timberland was million for as compared to million for see timberland transactions below 
ebitda for the timber segment decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease in ebitda was primarily the result of the significant gain on sale of timberland in the prior period slightly offset by higher timber sales 
other income statement changes gain on sale of timberland gain on sale of timberland decreased million in as compared to primarily due to the timberland sales described in the timberland transactions section below 
other income  net other income  net increased million in as compared to the change in other income was primarily due to an increase from gains on the sale of closed facilities and equipment in comparison to cost of products sold the cost of products sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in this increase was primarily caused by weakening in the paper  packaging services segment  which was affected by increased raw material costs  especially occ  without a corresponding increase in sales prices 
the increase was partially offset by an overall improvement in the industrial packaging services segment  which resulted from lower raw material costs  as a percentage of net sales  and improved operating efficiencies 
higher timber segment sales  which have a very low cost associated with them  also benefited our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million of net sales in as compared to million of net sales in the million increase was primarily due item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to additional sg a expenses related to van leer industrial packaging  including million of additional amortization expense related to the acquisition s goodwill and other intangible assets 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  primarily increased as a result of lower sales volumes  on a comparable structure basis  for industrial packaging services and lower net sales in the paper  packaging services segment 
in addition  the results were impacted by higher employee benefit costs and certain non recurring costs related to our organizational improvement initiatives and ongoing reorganization activities 
restructuring charge during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pretax restructuring charge due to the reorganization activities described in the restructuring plans section below 
debt extinguishment charge during  we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of million million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter related to the extinguishment of the indebtedness outstanding under the million senior secured credit agreement 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased to million during as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding of million during as compared to million during the increase in average debt outstanding was primarily the result of borrowings made in connection with the van leer industrial packaging acquisition 
because the acquisition occurred on march   the acquisition related debt was outstanding for only eight months in as compared to all of income taxes the effective tax rate decreased to for as compared to in  primarily as a result of a change in the mix of income from outside north america 
minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries as part of the van leer industrial packaging acquisition  we acquired majority holdings in various companies 
the operating results of these companies have been included in the consolidated results following the acquisition on march   and the minority interest of other persons in the respective net income of these companies has been reflected as an expense

the increase in net sales from the north american operations was due to the industrial packaging services segment million increase  which was partially offset by lower net sales in the paper  packaging services segment million decrease and the timber segment million decrease 
the higher net sales in the north american operations of the industrial packaging services segment were primarily due to the inclusion of additional sales volume from the operations of van leer industrial packaging 
the weaker economic conditions in the united states that prevailed throughout compared to caused lower sales volumes and increased competitive pricing in both the industrial packaging services and paper  packaging services segments 
ebitda was million  before the million second quarter restructuring charge  for as compared to million for the million increase in ebitda was attributable to higher gains on the sale of timberland million increase and the inclusion of the operations of van leer industrial packaging

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring plans during the second quarter of  we approved a plan to consolidate some of our locations in order to eliminate duplicate facilities caused by the van leer industrial packaging acquisition and improve operating efficiencies and capabilities 
the plan was the result of an in depth study to determine whether certain locations  either existing or newly acquired  should be closed and the sales and manufacturing volume associated with such plants relocated to a different facility 
six existing company owned plastic drum and steel drum plants were identified to be closed 
these plants are located in north america

balance sheet changes the reduction in trade accounts receivable was due mostly to lower net sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories were higher primarily due to the increases in our raw material costs 
the increase in accounts payable was due to higher raw material costs and the timing of payments made to our suppliers 
accrued payroll and employee benefits were higher as a result of the increase in these costs as well as timing of our payments 
the restructuring reserves decreased as a result of plant closings and other reorganization costs see restructuring plans section above

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued forward looking statements  certain factors affecting future results statements contained in this form k or any other reports or documents prepared by us may be forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our operating results to differ materially from those projected 
the following factors  among others  in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our actual financial performance 
changes in general economic or business conditions 
our customers generally consist of other manufacturers and suppliers who purchase our industrial shipping containers and containerboard for their own containment and shipping purposes 
because we supply a cross section of industries  such as chemicals  food products  petroleum products  pharmaceuticals and metal products  demand for our industrial shipping containers and containerboard and related corrugated products has historically corresponded to changes in general economic and business conditions of the industries and countries in which we operate 
accordingly  our financial performance is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions existing in these industries and countries  and any prolonged or substantial economic downturn could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
currency exchange and political risk 
we have operations in over countries 
as a result of our non us operations  we are subject to certain risks which could disrupt our operations or force us to incur unanticipated costs 
our operating performance is affected by devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates by translations into us dollars for financial reporting purposes of the assets and liabilities of our non us operations conducted in local currencies  and gains or losses from non us operations conducted in currencies other than their functional currency 
we are subject to various other risks associated with operating in non us countries  such as the following political  social and economic instability  war  civil disturbance or acts of terrorism  taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation  changes in government policies and regulations  imposition of limitations on conversions of non us currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by non us subsidiaries  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non us subsidiaries  hyperinflation in certain non us countries  and impositions or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by non us governments 
competition 
our business of manufacturing and selling industrial shipping containers  containerboard and corrugated products is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are price  quality and service 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have significantly greater financial resources 
changes in industry demands 
industry demand for containerboard has declined in recent years causing competitive pricing pressures in the containerboard market which has negatively impacted our financial performance in recent years 
we compete in industries which are capital intensive  which generally leads to continued production as long as prices are sufficient to cover marginal costs 
as a result  changes in industry demands  including industry over capacity  may cause substantial price competition and  in turn  negatively impact our financial performance 
continuing consolidation of customer base for containerboard and corrugated products 
over the last few years  many of our large containerboard and corrugated products customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines 
this consolidation has increased the concentration of this segment of our business with our largest customers and resulted in increased pricing pressures from our customers 
the continuing consolidation of the customer base in this segment may negatively impact our financial performance 
raw material and energy price fluctuations and shortages 
the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are steel  resins  pulpwood  waste paper for recycling and paper  which we purchase in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
some of these materials have been  and in the future may be  in short supply 
however  we have not recently experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining our principal raw materials 
we do not have long term supply contracts or hedging arrangements in place for obtaining our principal raw materials 
the cost of producing our products is sensitive to the price of energy 
energy prices  in particular oil and natural gas  have increased significantly over the past year  with a corresponding effect on our production costs 
environmental and health and safety matters  product liability claims 
we must comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding federal  state  local and non us environmental matters  such as air and water quality and waste disposal 
we must also comply with extensive rules and regulations regarding safety and health matters 
the failure to materially item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded comply with such rules and regulations could adversely affect our operations 
furthermore  litigation or claims against us with respect to such matters could adversely affect our financial performance 
we may also become subject to product liability claims which could adversely affect us 
work stoppages 
we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a significant number of our north american employees are represented by collective bargaining units 
we have experienced work stoppages and strikes in the past  and there may be work stoppages and strikes in the future 
any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks associated with acquisitions 
during the past several years we have invested  and for the foreseeable future we anticipate investing  a substantial amount of capital in acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the failure to retain key employees and contracts and the inability to integrate businesses without material disruption 
in addition  other companies in our industries have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into our operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that we will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions 
in addition  the costs of unsuccessful acquisition efforts may adversely affect our financial performance 
risks of property loss 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire and extended coverage insurance on most of our facilities  with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  acts of terrorism  or natural disasters  that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in that property  as well as the anticipated future revenues derived from the manufacturing activities conducted at that property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any such loss would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
timber and timberland sales 
we have a significant inventory of standing timber and timberlands 
the frequency and volume of sales of timber and timberlands will have an effect on our financial performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk related to our financial instruments that include borrowings under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement and interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million as of october  we do item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements have been entered into to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates and changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the existing amended and restated senior secured credit agreement  the table presents scheduled amortizations of principal and the current weighted average interest rate by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents annual amortizations of notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
under the swap agreements  we receive interest quarterly from the counterparties and pay interest quarterly to the counterparties 
the fair value of the existing amended and restated senior secured credit agreement is based on current rates available to us for debt of the same remaining maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements has been determined based upon the current market settlement prices of comparable contracts 
financial instruments dollars in millions expected maturity date total fair value after amended and restated senior secured credit agreement scheduled amortizations average interest rate interest rate swaps scheduled amortizations average pay rate average receive rate variable rate specified is based on the libor rate or an alternative base rate plus a calculated margin at october  the average pay rate is based upon the fixed rates we were scheduled to pay at october   along with one additional agreement where we pay the libor rate plus 
the average receive rate is based upon the libor rates we were scheduled to receive at october   along with one additional agreement where we receive a fixed rate of 
the rates presented are not intended to project our expectations for the future 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed by the counterparties at october   a basis point increase in interest rates would improve the fair value of the swap agreements to a liability of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concluded million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a fair value liability of million 
foreign currency risk as a result of our acquisition of van leer industrial packaging  our operating income is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the geographic presence of our operations mitigates this exposure to some degree 
additionally  our transaction exposure is somewhat limited because we produce and sell a majority of our products within each country in which we operate 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain short term intercompany loan balances among our foreign businesses 
at october   we had contracts outstanding of million 
the fair value of these contracts at october  resulted in a loss of million 
each of these contracts hedges the exposure of the euro against the fluctuation of various other currencies 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the euro against these other currencies indicates that if the euro uniformly weakened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million 
conversely  if the euro uniformly strengthened by against all of the hedged currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would increase by million 
any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
commodity price risk our operating income is potentially affected to a significant degree by fluctuations in the cost of our raw materials and energy see safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 
we do not have long term supply contracts or hedging arrangements in place for obtaining our principal raw materials 
in general  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices
