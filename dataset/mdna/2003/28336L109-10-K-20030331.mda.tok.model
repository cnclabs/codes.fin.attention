item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the subheading recent developments 
further  for environmental matters  it is also possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from our current or past operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities in the future 
as new information regarding our outstanding legal matters  environmental matters and rates and regulatory matters becomes available  or relevant developments occur  we will review our accruals and make any appropriate adjustments 
the impact of these changes may have a material effect on our results of operations  our financial position  and on our cash flows in the period the event occurs 
other matters lng time charters 
during and  we contracted to charter four lng tankers  with an option to charter a fifth ship  to transport lng from supply areas to domestic and international market centers 
in february  following our announced plan to minimize our involvement in the lng business  we entered into various agreements with the ship owners under which all four of the ship charters and our option for chartering the fifth ship were cancelled in consideration of payments by us totaling million 
on two of the ship charters  the ship owners assumed responsibility for the charter of those vessels  and we paid million for the capital costs associated with fitting those two ships with regasification capabilities 
in connection with transferring the chartering responsibilities back to the ship owners  we agreed to provide letters of credit  fully collateralized by cash  equal to million that could be drawn on by ship owners to cover additional capital costs and any shortfalls in the rates at which they are able to charter the vessels compared to the rates provided for in the original charter agreements adjusted for capital costs we have already paid 
in the event that the ship owners are able to charter the ships at rates in excess of the original rates  as adjusted  we will share in the benefits 
we also retained rights to charter some of the vessels for use in our future lng activities 
in connection with these transactions  our future exposure to the ship arrangements is limited to million 
enron bankruptcy 
in december  enron corp 
and a number of its subsidiaries  including enron north america corp 
and enron power marketing  inc  epmi filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
we had contracts with enron north america  enron power marketing and other enron subsidiaries for  among other things  the transportation of natural gas and ngl and the trading of physical natural gas  power  petroleum and financial derivatives 
our merchant energy positions are governed under a master international swap dealers association  inc agreement  various master natural gas agreements  a master power purchase and sale agreement  and other commodity agreements 
we terminated most of these trading related contracts  which we believe was proper and in accordance with the terms of these contracts 
in october  we filed proofs of claim for our domestic trading positions against enron trading entities in an amount totaling approximately million 
also in october  our european trading business asserted million in claims against enron capital and trade resources limited which is subject to proceedings in the united kingdom 
after considering the cash margins enron has deposited with us as well as the reserves we have established  our overall merchant energy exposure to enron is million  which is classified as current accounts and notes receivable 
we believe this amount is reasonable based on offers received to purchase the claims 
in february  merchant energy received a letter from epmi demanding payment under a march power purchase and sale agreement agreement of approximately million 
merchant energy responded to the february demand letter denying that any sums were due epmi under the agreement 
in addition  epmi has now made demand on us for this sum based on an august  guaranty agreement 
epmi has now filed a lawsuit against merchant energy and el paso in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york seeking to collect these sums 
we have denied liability 
in addition  various enron subsidiaries had transportation contracts on several of our pipeline systems 
most of these transportation contracts have now been rejected  and our pipeline subsidiaries have filed proofs of claim totaling approximately million 
epng filed the largest proof of claim in the amount of approximately million  which included million for amounts due for services provided through the date the contracts were rejected and million for damage claims arising from the rejection of its transportation contracts 
the september order in the epng capacity allocation proceeding discussed in rates and regulatory matters above prohibits epng from remarketing enron capacity that was not remarketed prior to may  epng has sought rehearing of the september order 
we have fully reserved for the amounts due through the date the contracts were rejected  and we have not recognized any amounts under these contracts since the rejection date 
as a result of current circumstances surrounding the energy sector  the creditworthiness of several industry participants has been called into question 
we have taken actions to mitigate our exposure to these participants  however  should several industry participants file for chapter bankruptcy protection and contracts with our various subsidiaries are not assumed by other counterparties  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
broadwing arbitration 
in june  el paso global networks epgn  formerly known as el paso communications company  entered into an agreement with broadwing communications services broadwing to construct and maintain a fiber optic telecommunications system from houston  texas to los angeles  california 
in may  epgn terminated its agreements with broadwing due to broadwing s failure to meet its contractual obligations 
broadwing disputed epgn s right to terminate the agreements 
subsequently  epgn filed a demand for arbitration and named its arbitrator 
we have also sought and obtained injunctive relief to require broadwing to perform maintenance activity and prohibit it from removing materials or equipment purchased for the project 
if it is determined that we properly terminated the contract  broadwing is required to return all money paid by us which is million and transfer all of the work completed to date free and clear of any liens 
the arbitration is scheduled for the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the value of this long haul route by million  leaving a total investment of million 
economic conditions of brazil 
we have investments in power  pipeline and production projects in brazil  including an investment in gemstone  with an aggregate exposure  including financial guarantees  of approximately billion 
during  brazil experienced a significant decline in its financial markets due largely to concerns over the refinancing of brazil s foreign debt and the presidential elections which were completed in late october these concerns have contributed to higher interest rates on local debt for the government and private sectors  have significantly decreased the availability of funds from lenders outside of brazil and have decreased the amount of foreign investment in the country 
these factors have contributed to a downgrade of brazil s foreign currency debt rating and a percent devaluation of the local currency against the us dollar during these developments are likely to delay the implementation of project financings underway in brazil 
the international monetary fund announced in the fourth quarter a billion loan package for brazil  however  the release of the majority of the money will depend on brazil committing to specified fiscal targets in in addition  brazil s newly elected president may impose changes affecting our business  including imposing tariff controls on electricity and fuels 
we currently believe that the economic difficulties in brazil will not have a material adverse effect on our investment in the country  but we continue to monitor the economic situation and any potential changes in governmental policy 
future developments in brazil could cause us to reassess our exposure 
gemstone  our affiliate  owns a percent interest in a mw gas fired power project  known as the araucaria project  located near curitiba  brazil 
our investment in the araucaria project was million at december  the project company in which we have an ownership interest has a year power purchase agreement ppa with copel  a regional utility 
copel is approximately percent owned by the state of parana 
after the recent elections in brazil  the new governor of the state of parana publicly characterized the araucaria project as unfavorable to copel and the state of parana and promised a full review of the transaction 
subsequent to this announcement  copel informed us that they will not pay capacity payments due under the ppa pending that review 
previous payments made under the ppa were made with a reservation of rights with respect to the enforceability of the contract 
we are meeting with the government as well as new management at copel to discuss copel s obligations under the power purchase agreement 
if we are unable to come to a satisfactory resolution of the current issues under the ppa  we may be required to initiate enforcement of our remedies under the contract  including filing an arbitration proceeding under the international chamber of commerce rules in paris 
if we do not prevail in that proceeding  or are not otherwise able to enforce our remedies under the contract  we could be required to impair our investment in the project 
our losses would be limited to our investment 
meizhou wan power project 
we own a percent equity interest in a mw  coal fired power generating project  meizhou wan generating  located in fuzhou  people s republic of china 
our investment in the project was million at december   and we have also issued million in guarantees and letters of credit for equity support and debt service reserves for the project 
the project debt is collateralized only by the project s assets and is non recourse to us 
the project declared that it was ready for commercial operations in august  however  the provincial government  who also buys all power generated from the project  has not accepted the project for commercial operations 
in october  we reached an interim agreement to allow the plant to operate and sell power at reduced rates until march while a long term resolution to existing and past contract terms is negotiated 
the price the project receives from the sale of power in the interim agreement is expected to be sufficient to provide for the operating costs and debt service of the project  but does not provide for a return on investment to the project s owners 
if the project is unable to reach a long term agreement with the provincial government  with higher rates than in the interim agreement  we could be required to impair our investment in the project  since cash flows from the project would not be sufficient to provide us with a return of our investment  and we may incur additional losses if our guarantees and letters of credit are called upon 
our losses are limited to the extent of our investment  guarantees and letters of credit 
at december   we impaired million of our goodwill related to our investment in this project 
milford power project 
we own a percent direct equity interest in a mw power plant construction project located in milford  connecticut 
chaparral  our affiliate  owns an additional percent interest in this project 
the project has been financed through equity contributions  construction financing from lenders that is recourse only to the project and through a construction management services agreement that we funded 
this project has experienced significant construction delays  primarily associated with technological difficulties with its turbines including the inability to operate on both gas and fuel oil or to operate at its designed capacity as specified in the construction contract 
in october  we entered into a construction management services agreement providing additional funding through october  the construction contractor failed to complete construction of the plant prior to october   in accordance with the terms and specifications of the construction contract 
as a result  the project was in default under its construction lending agreement 
on october   we entered into a standstill agreement with the construction lending banks that expired on december  we will continue negotiating with the contractor and with the lending banks to attempt to reach agreements on contract disputes  including resolution of liquidated damages that are due to the project under the terms of the construction contract and for successful completion of plant construction 
on march   we provided a notice to milford declaring an event of default under the fuel supply agreement between us and milford due to non payment by milford 
on march   milford received a notice from its lenders stating that the lenders intended to commence foreclosure on the project in accordance with the lending agreement within days 
as a result of the default under the construction lending agreement  we evaluated our investment and recorded an impairment charge of million while chaparral recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of at december   our direct investment in the project was million of loans to milford under a construction management services agreement 
we have also provided a guarantee of million to fund a debt service account for milford 
we may be required to fund the account should the facility not be financially able to do so within two years from its commercial operations date 
if we are unable to reach a negotiated settlement of the disputes with the lending banks  the banks may have the right to accelerate the construction loan and foreclose on the project which may result in an impairment of our construction loans  including the guaranteed amount in the project 
if this occurred  we could record an impairment charge of up to million 
berkshire power project 
we own a percent direct equity interest in a mw power plant located in massachusetts 
chaparral  our affiliate  owns an additional percent interest in this project 
the construction contractor failed to deliver a plant capable of operating on both gas and fuel oil  or capable of operating at its designed capacity 
berkshire is negotiating with the contractor with respect to its failure to deliver the project in accordance with guaranteed specifications  including fuel oil firing capability 
during the third quarter of  the project lenders asserted that berkshire was in default on its loan agreement 
berkshire is in the process of negotiating with its lenders to resolve disputed contract terms 
failure to reach a satisfactory resolution in these matters could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment in the project 
at december   our direct investment in berkshire was million  including receivables of million under a subordinated fuel agreement  and chaparral s investment was million 
we continue to discuss settlement opportunities with our construction contractor 
ppn power project 
our subsidiary owns a percent minority equity interest in a mw dual fuel naphtha and natural gas fired generating plant located in tamil nadu province  india 
the project achieved commercial operations in april and obtained dual fuel capability in september the project sells power to the tamil nadu electricity board tneb 
the tneb has paid for power at a rate lower than the rate called for in the power purchase agreement and at december  the project had overdue receivables of million 
the tneb has requested an increase in the rates that it is permitted to charge customers within its service territory in order to provide revenues sufficient to make payments owed to us 
amounts currently being paid are sufficient to cover debt service and normal operating expenses but are insufficient to cover maintenance and a return on equity 
if the project is unable to reach a long term agreement with the tneb to collect rates higher than those currently being paid  the project may incur losses as the plant continues to operate 
recent events have also made the possibility of long term operations on natural gas less likely which has the effect of increasing the operating cost of the project because the use of naphtha makes electric generation more expensive on a per kilowatt hour basis 
at december   we impaired all of our investment in this project  which totaled million

we maintain operating leases in the ordinary course of our business activities 
these leases include those for office space and operating facilities and office and operating equipment  and the terms of the agreements vary from until as of december   our total commitments under operating leases were approximately million 
under several of our leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessor 
for the total outstanding residual value guarantees on our operating leases at december   see residual value guarantees below 
minimum annual rental commitments at december   were as follows year ending december  operating leases in millions thereafter total aggregate minimum commitments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately million due in the future under noncancelable subleases 
rental expense on our operating leases for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million 
guarantees 
we are involved in various joint ventures and other ownership arrangements that sometimes require additional financial support that results in the issuance of financial and performance guarantees 
in a financial guarantee  we are obligated to make payments if the guaranteed party fails to make payments under  or violates the terms of  the financial arrangement 
in a performance guarantee  we provide assurance that the guaranteed party will execute on the terms of the contract 
if they do not  we are required to perform on their behalf 
for example  if the guaranteed party is required to deliver natural gas to a third party and then fails to do so  we would be required to either deliver that natural gas or make payments to the third party equal to the difference between the contract price and the market value of the natural gas 
as of december   we had approximately billion of both financial and performance guarantees outstanding 
of this amount  approximately billion relates to our chaparral investment and million relates to our gemstone investment 
the remaining million relates to other global power equity investments  including some of the projects under chaparral and gemstone  and pipeline and petroleum activities 
residual value guarantees 
under two of our operating leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessor 
under these guarantees  we can either choose to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term for a specified amount  which is typically equal to the outstanding loan amounts owed by the lessor  or we can choose to assist in the sale of the leased asset to a third party 
should the asset not be sold for a price that equals or exceeds the amount of the guarantee  we would be obligated for the shortfall 
the levels of our residual value guarantees range from percent to percent of the original cost of the leased assets 
accounting for these residual value guarantees will be impacted effective july   by our adoption of the new accounting rules on consolidations 
for a discussion of the accounting impact of these new rules  see note as of december   we had purchase options and residual value guarantees associated with operating leases for the following assets purchase residual value lease asset description option guarantee expiration in millions lakeside technology center telecommunications facility facility at aruba refinery other commercial commitments

these options met all performance targets in december performance units we award eligible officers performance units that are payable in cash or stock at the end of the vesting period 
the final value of the performance units may vary according to the plan under which they are granted  but is usually based on our common stock price at the end of the vesting period or total shareholder return during the vesting period relative to our peer group 
the value of the performance units is charged ratably to compensation expense over the vesting period with periodic adjustments to account for the fluctuation in the market price of our stock or changes in expected total shareholder return

employee stock purchase program in october  we implemented an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code 
the plan allows participating employees the right to purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at percent of the lower of the market price at the beginning of the plan period or at the end of each calendar quarter 
five million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under this plan

however  we record a liability for the withholdings not yet applied towards the purchase of common stock 
we bear all expenses associated with administering the plan  except for costs  including any applicable taxes  associated with the participants sale of common stock 
effective january   we have suspended our employee stock purchase program 
segment information we segregate our business activities into four distinct operating segments pipelines  production  field services and merchant energy 
these segments are strategic business units that provide a variety of energy products and services 
they are managed separately as each business unit requires different technology and marketing strategies 
in the second quarter of  we reclassified our historical coal mining operations from our merchant energy segment to discontinued operations in our financial statements 
all periods were restated to reflect this change 
our pipelines segment provides natural gas transmission  storage  gathering and related services in the us and internationally 
we conduct our activities primarily through seven wholly owned and seven partially owned interstate transmission systems along with six underground natural gas storage entities and an lng terminalling facility 
our pipeline operations also include access between our us based systems and canada and mexico as well as interests in three operating natural gas transmission systems in australia 
our production segment is engaged in the exploration for  and the acquisition  development and production of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids  primarily in north america 
in the us  production has onshore and coal seam operations and properties in states and offshore operations and properties in federal and state waters in the gulf of mexico 
internationally  we have exploration and production rights in australia  bolivia  brazil  canada  hungary  indonesia and turkey 
our field services segment provides customers with wellhead to mainline services  including natural gas gathering  products extraction  fractionation  dehydration  purification  compression and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
field services assets include processing plants and related gathering facilities located in the south texas  louisiana  mid continent and rocky mountain regions  as well as our interest in el paso energy partners 
our merchant energy segment consists of three primary divisions global power  petroleum and energy trading 
we buy  sell and trade natural gas  power  crude oil  refined products  coal and other energy commodities throughout the world  and own or have interests in power plants in countries 
we use ebit to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business segments 
we define ebit as operating income  adjusted for several items  including equity earnings from unconsolidated investments  minority interests on consolidated  but less than wholly owned operating subsidiaries and other miscellaneous non operating items 
items that are not included in this measure are financing costs  including interest and debt expense and returns on preferred interest of consolidated subsidiaries  income taxes  discontinued operations  extraordinary items and the impact of accounting changes 
we believe this measurement is useful to our investors because it allows them to evaluate the effectiveness of our businesses and operations and our investments from an operational perspective  exclusive of the costs to finance those activities and exclusive of income taxes  neither of which are directly relevant to the efficiency of those operations 
this measurement may not be comparable to measurements used by other companies and should not be used as a substitute for net income or other performance measures such as operating cash flow

chaparral s corporate structure is a limited liability company that  at december   was owned approximately by us and approximately by an unaffiliated investor  limestone 
limestone is capitalized by private equity contributions of million from a group of unrelated financial investors through credit suisse first boston corporation and billion of senior secured notes issued to institutional investors 
limestone is controlled by subsidiaries or affiliates of credit suisse first boston corporation 
in march  we notified limestone that we would exercise our right under the partnership agreements to purchase all of the outstanding third party equity in limestone on may   for million 
also in march  we contributed billion to limestone in exchange for a non controlling interest  which limestone then used to pay off the limestone notes which matured on march  following our investment of billion in limestone  our effective ownership in chaparral increased to approximately percent 
we continue to account for our investment in chaparral under the equity method since we do not control limestone  and therefore do not control chaparral 
we will  however  consolidate chaparral upon the purchase of the remaining limestone equity interest  which we anticipate will occur in may at that time  we will record the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair values 
the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired will be impacted by changes in the unregulated power industry as a whole  as well as by changes in regional power prices in the us any excess of the proceeds paid over the fair value of net assets acquired will be reflected as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but it will be tested for impairment

if we sell these investments  the maturity date of the notes may be accelerated 
chaparral has used our funds and the funds contributed by limestone to acquire the domestic power generation and related businesses described above 
in some cases  chaparral acquired these power generation assets from us 
chaparral did not acquire any power generation assets from us in chaparral acquired power generation assets from us with a value of million in  which we determined to be a fair and reasonable amount 
we did not recognize any gains or losses on those transactions 
in addition to the financing transactions described above  we have also entered into various contractual agreements with chaparral related to management and trading activities 
we serve as manager of chaparral under a management agreement that expires in we are compensated for the services we provide through an annual management fee  which has performance based and fixed components 
the performance fee was determined based on how well we performed as manager of chaparral  and was determined by evaluating the changes in the value of the portfolio of power assets held by chaparral

the reserve data represents only estimates 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the significant changes to reserves  other than purchases  sales or production  are due to reservoir performance in existing fields and from drilling additional wells in existing fields 
there have been no major discoveries or other events  favorable or adverse  that may be considered to have caused a significant change in the estimated proved reserves since december results of operations from producing activities by fiscal year were as follows at december in millions united other states canada countries worldwide net revenues sales to external customers affiliated sales   total   production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization ceiling test charges income tax expense benefit results of operations from producing activities net revenues sales to external customers affiliated sales   total   production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization ceiling test charges income tax expense benefit results of operations from producing activities includes international operations in brazil  hungary and indonesia

for the calculations in the preceding table  estimated future cash inflows from estimated future production of proved reserves were computed using year end market natural gas and oil prices 
we may receive amounts different than the standardized measure of discounted cash flow for a number of reasons  including price changes and the effects of our hedging activities 
we do not rely upon the standardized measure when making investment and operating decisions 
these decisions are based on various factors including probable and proved reserves  different price and cost assumptions  actual economic conditions  capital availability and corporate investment criteria
