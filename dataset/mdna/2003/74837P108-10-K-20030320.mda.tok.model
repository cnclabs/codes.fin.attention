overview we design and sell field programmable gate arrays  embedded standard products  associated software and programming hardware 
from our inception in april through the third quarter of  we were primarily engaged in product development 
in  we introduced our first line of field programmable gate array products  or fpgas  based upon our vialink technology 
we currently have four fpga product families pasic  introduced in  pasic  introduced in  and pasic  introduced in we introduced our eclipse family of fpgas in the newer product families generally contain greater logic capacity  but do not necessarily replace sales of older generation products 
in september  we introduced quickram  our first line of embedded standard products  or esps 
our esps are based on our fpga technology 
in april  we introduced quickpci  our second line of esps 
during  we introduced the quickmips and other families of esps 
esp products accounted for of total revenue in we also license our quickworks and quicktools design software and sell our programming hardware  which together have typically accounted for less than of total revenue 
in april  we signed a definitive agreement with v to acquire certain assets of v in a stock transaction 
we also entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with v pending the sale in order to ensure continued distribution of v s products to its customers 
v  based in toronto  canada  manufactured assps that enhance high speed data throughput within telecommunications and internet infrastructure systems 
to facilitate the asset sale and the subsequent windup of v as a distinct entity  v filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy laws in may in august  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of v  for approximately million shares of our common stock  valued at million 
the acquisition has accelerated our esp strategy by strengthening our ability to develop and market system level products 
on june   v s plan of reorganization was approved by the bankruptcy court 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s to allow v to sell shares to satisfy its creditors in cash 
on july   the sec declared the s effective 
on december   we entered into a share purchase agreement  foundry agreement and other related agreements with tower 
under the agreements  we agreed to make a million strategic investment in tower as part of tower s plan to build a new wafer fabrication facility 
the new fabrication facility is expected to produce mm wafers in geometries of micron and below  using advanced cmos technology from toshiba 
in fiscal  we made payments of million to purchase shares of common stock and wafer credits from tower under the agreements 
in september of  due to an other than temporary decline in the value of the stock  we wrote down its holding value by million 
at december   quicklogic s balance sheet reflected  shares in tower with a carrying value of million  and million in wafer credits 
on may   we entered into an amendment to the original tower share purchase agreement 
under the amended agreement  tower agreed to issue shares with a value equal to of the amount of the next two milestone payments due under the agreement  and wafer purchase credits equal to of the payments 
the wafer purchase credits issued under the amended agreement can be applied toward wafer purchases from tower  up to of the value of these purchases 
after july   they can be applied at up to of the value of the wafer purchases 
in addition  tower released us from its lockup on  of the previously purchased shares  allowing us to sell these shares on the open market 
under the amended agreement  quicklogic made two payments of million each on may  and october  in exchange  we received an additional  shares and million in wafer credits 
as of december   we have a remaining payment of million that will be payable to tower under the terms of the amended agreements if tower meets milestones related to the operation of the fabrication facility prior to july even if tower has not met the milestones  we may invest all or a portion of these funds under renegotiated terms 
in december of  due to an other than temporary decline in the value of the stock  quicklogic wrote down the holding value by million 
at december   quicklogic s balance sheet reflected  shares in tower with a carrying value of million  and million in prepaid wafer credits 
of these shares   are available for sale  which are marked to market each reporting period 
any temporary change in the value of these shares is recorded as comprehensive income or loss 
as of december  there was no comprehensive income or loss associated with these shares 
we sell our products through two channels 
we sell the majority of our products through distributors who have contractual rights to earn a negotiated margin on the sale of our products 
we refer to these distributors as point of sale distributors 
we defer recognition of revenue for sales of unprogrammed products to these point of sale distributors until after they have sold these products to systems manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on programmed products at the time of shipment 
approximately of our products sold by point of sale distributors are programmed by us and are not returnable by these point of sale distributors 
we also sell our products directly to systems manufacturers and recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
the percentage of sales derived through distributors and direct sales in was and respectively 
in it was and  respectively  and in  and  respectively 
five distributors accounted for    and of sales  respectively  in and four distributors accounted for approximately    and of sales  respectively  in five distributors accounted for    and of sales  respectively  in we expect that a limited number of distributors will continue to account for a significant portion of our total sales 
we believe our products are proprietary and sole source  and that the loss of a particular distributor would not result in a short term disruption in sales of our products  since our customers would either buy our products from another distributor or directly from us 
a large number of systems manufacturers purchase our products through our distributors or from us directly 
one of these manufacturers accounted for of revenue in otherwise  individual manufacturers do not typically account for or more of our annual revenue 
one customer  purchasing esp products through a distributor  accounted for of fourth quarter revenue  and we expect that this customer will continue to generate significant revenue through the middle of our international sales were  and of our total sales for  and  respectively 
we expect that revenue derived from sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant and growing portion of our total revenue 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
average selling prices for our products typically decline rapidly during the first six to twelve months after their introduction  then decline less rapidly as the products mature 
we attempt to maintain gross margins even as average selling prices decline through the introduction of new products with higher margins and through manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions 
however  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain gross margins 
any significant decline in our gross margins will materially harm our business 
we outsource the wafer manufacturing  assembly and test of all of our products 
we currently rely upon tsmc  cypress and samsung to manufacture our products  and we rely primarily upon amkor technology  chippac  inc and ase to assemble  test and program our products 
we expect to manufacture products at tower in our wafer suppliers lead times are often as long as three months and sometimes longer 
in addition  under our arrangements with cypress and tower  we are obligated to provide forecasts and enter into binding obligations for anticipated wafer purchases 
these long manufacturing cycle times are at odds with our customers desire for short delivery lead times and as a result we typically purchase wafers based on internal forecasts of demand 
in the future  to the extent that we inaccurately forecast total demand or the mix of demand  we may have limited our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could lead to excesses or shortages of wafers for a particular product 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenue for certain items in our statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment restructuring costs income loss from operations write down of marketable securities interest expense interest income and other  net net income loss years ended december   and revenue 
our revenue for  and was million  million and million  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and growth of from to from to  revenue declined by million  primarily due to an million reduction in our telecom and data communications revenue  and to a million decline in instrumentation and test revenue 
our fpga revenue declined by or million during this period  in line with other competitors in the industry 
we believe that two primary factors caused our revenue to decline the telecommunications industry made technical advances significantly increasing the capacity of their existing fiber optic infrastructure  and significantly reduced hardware systems spending by companies in the internet industry 
we believe this also caused reduced system purchases by companies supplying the hardware infrastructure to these industries 
the majority of the increase in revenue  as compared with  was due to growth in sales of our esps  which increased by  or million 
our esp product revenue also increased from to by million or  driven primarily by v product sales 
we expect that during our new product revenue growth will be greater than the revenue decline of our mature pasic and pasic products 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
the decline in gross profit from to was due to manufacturing overhead costs allocated over lower manufacturing volume  a write off of approximately million in excess die inventory and a small increase in direct manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margin from to was primarily driven by inventory write offs that were million lower in compared to we expect that as our manufacturing volumes return to historical levels  our gross profit percentage  which is expected to remain less than or equal to in  should also return to the range 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million  million and million in  and respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
late in  we added research and development centers in toronto  canada formerly v and bangalore  india  and these centers expended  for research and development in the remainder of the increase for was due to increased spending to accelerate the introduction of our quickmips family of products 
in  research and development expense includes million for the write off of long lived assets 
this charge was triggered by the abandonment of certain product design activities and related technical decisions  and includes the write off of certain emulation hardware and intellectual property that we acquired in the v acquisition 
this write off was offset by lower compensation expenses of million and lower outside services of million  reflecting our reduction in force and reduced engineering activities 
we believe that continued investments in process technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect that these development efforts will allow us to expand our product offering and provide additional value to our customers 
we expect to continue to invest in research and development at levels comparable to our fourth quarter expenses  or as much as to million per quarter  during the next few quarters 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively  which was  and of revenue for those periods 
we kept these expenses relatively flat from to  but they rose as a percentage of revenue due to the decrease in revenue for the period 
selling  general and administrative expense was reduced by approximately million from to  primarily due to a million reduction in marketing expenses  including a  reduction in compensation expenses  a  reduction in outside services and a  reduction in other marketing activities 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense will increase slightly during  primarily due to higher commission payments to independent sales representatives 
this commission increase is driven by sales to certain customers  which are expected to increase during we expect an increase in first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses due to annual reporting and sales meeting expenses 
goodwill impairment 
on august   we acquired certain assets of v  a toronto based manufacturer of assps  for a total of million 
of this purchase consideration  we allocated approximately million to the net assets acquired  and million to goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment test on the goodwill on an annual basis  and when circumstances lead us to believe that an impairment has occurred 
as such  we completed an annual impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal  and determined that there was no impairment at that time  based on the results of an independent appraisal 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization  as implied by our stock price  dropped below quicklogic s net asset value 
accordingly  we performed another impairment analysis  including an independent appraisal 
as a result of the analysis  we recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge completely wrote off the goodwill amount on our balance sheet and was included as a component of operating income 
as the charge was non cash in nature  it did not affect our liquidity 
restructuring costs 
in october  we reduced our worldwide headcount by approximately 
we wrote off  of intellectual property associated with a cancelled product and incurred  in severance and other employee related costs 
these charges were reflected in our fourth quarter results as a restructuring charge of  in november  we reduced our worldwide headcount by approximately and closed offices in la palma  california and richardson  texas 
we undertook these restructuring activities to better align our overhead and expenses with our level of revenue and gross profit 
the severance and office closure expenses are reflected in our fourth quarter results as a  restructuring charge 
deferred compensation 
with respect to the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  in there was no deferred compensation recorded as a result of stock option grants to employees in  or the amount of deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we amortized   and  in  and  respectively 
the amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the related employees activities 
write down of marketable securities 
in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of  it was determined that our investment in tower stock had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary 
this determination was made after the average market value of the tower stock  as quoted on the nasdaq national market  dropped below its carrying value for a significant period of time 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million and million in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively  based on the quoted market price of the stock on the last day of the reporting period 
interest expense  interest income and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million  million and  in  and  respectively 
interest and other income decreased in and in due to decreased cash balances  lower interest rates  and due to fees and interest expenses incurred under our credit facilities 
provision for income taxes 
in  we had the ability to utilize federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to offset our taxable income 
in and  we incurred additional tax losses 
however  our ability to utilize these losses in future periods was uncertain  and accordingly we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related tax benefit 
as such  no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded for  and as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will continue to expire through liquidity and capital resources at december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from cash held at december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
net cash provided by used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of million  offset by depreciation of million 
the cash flow impact of these items  totaling approximately million  was partially offset by cash used for a million increase in inventories  a million increase in accounts receivable  and a million increase in other assets 
the million increase in inventory resulted from higher revenue in compared to for instance  third quarter revenue of million was higher than revenue in the third quarter of this growth caused us to invest in inventory 
when revenue then declined sequentially in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our inventory consumption 
this reduction also contributed to the increase of inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to fourth quarter revenue that was million higher than year earlier levels 
the million used to acquire other assets included the license of intellectual property used in connection with our esps 
in  our primary use of cash was an operating loss of million  offset by depreciation of million and an inventory write down of million 
a decline in our quarterly inventory purchases and expenses at the end of caused a million reduction in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we purchased significant inventory during the first three quarters of the year  as a result of firm commitments with our suppliers  and this caused a million inventory increase for the year 
we also generated million of cash by reducing our accounts receivable during the year 
this accounts receivable decrease is primarily due to fourth quarter revenue that was million lower than revenue in the fourth quarter of in  we reduced our operating cash consumption by million 
the primary reasons for this improvement are a million reduction in our operating loss  net of depreciation and goodwill impairment charges  and the relative effect of inventory on our cash flow compared to inventory reductions contributed million of cash in  while inventory increased in and consumed million of cash that year 
accounts receivable increased by million primarily due to a increase in fourth quarter revenue compared to the fourth quarter of we reduced our accounts payable by million  reflecting lower manufacturing purchases 
net cash used for investing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the amount was used for the acquisition of property and equipment 
in  million was used for acquisition of property and equipment  while million was used for our investment in tower 
in  we reduced our investment in property and equipment to million and invested million in tower 
this reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment is primarily due to lower spending for new product tooling and due to adequate manufacturing capacity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in the primary source of cash was our follow on offering  offset by the repayment of  in bank debt 
in  the main source of cash flows from financing activities was million received from the exercise of stock options  which was offset by  used to repay bank debt 
in  the primary sources of cash included million from the sale of common stock under our stock plans and  of proceeds under our insurance credit facility 
cash was used to repay debt of  in  excluding the repayment of funds to silicon valley bank 
in june  we signed a million credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the facility includes an million revolving line of credit available until june and a million equipment and software financing line of credit 
we could draw funds against software purchases through december and may draw funds against equipment purchases through march the revolving line bears interest at prime  which was at december  the equipment line bears interest at prime plus  or at december   and is secured by the specific equipment financed 
silicon valley bank also has a security interest in our tangible and intangible assets 
interest payments on the revolving line are due monthly  and we incurred  of interest expense for draws against the revolving line during the equipment financing line must be paid in equal installments from the date of each advance 
any advances for software purchases under the equipment line must be paid in equal installments from the date of each advance 
terms of the facility require us to maintain cash and short term investment balances of million at silicon valley bank 
under this arrangement  a portion of our funds held in depository and investment accounts at silicon valley bank are classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
the amount of our restricted cash at december   million  was equal to our aggregate borrowings under the credit facility at that time 
this restricted cash is classified as a financing activity  and borrowings under the silicon valley bank facility did not have a net impact on our financing cash flows during terms of the facility also require us to maintain a tangible net worth of million 
we notified silicon valley bank that we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant of our credit facility as of october and november the bank waived the covenant for these periods and advanced funds to us through december 
at december   we were again in violation of the tangible net worth covenant and the bank again waived the covenant for this period 
we do not expect to meet the tangible net worth requirement at the end of our first fiscal quarter  and accordingly  we have classified the amount outstanding under the facility as a short term obligation 
as of december  we had million outstanding under this facility 
a portion of our deposit and investment accounts held at silicon valley bank are classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet  in support of these borrowings 
during we may decide to use our restricted cash to completely repay amounts outstanding under this facility  without any impact to our cash and cash equivalents  we may complete negotiations to restructure this credit facility  or we may obtain a new credit facility 
as of december  we also had  of short term debt outstanding to finance insurance payments and  outstanding under capital lease obligations 
the insurance related debt bears interest at the rate of and is being repaid in monthly amounts of  through july the capital lease obligations are being repaid in monthly amounts of  through december we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance our operating losses  and for future investment in tower  the acquisition of property and equipment  and the repayment of debt 
during  we may be required to invest million in tower under the terms of our agreements if tower meets milestones related to the operation of the fabrication facility prior to july even if tower has not met the milestones  we may invest all or a portion of these funds under renegotiated terms 
our future liquidity will depend on many factors such as these  as well as our level of sales and gross profit  market acceptance of our existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction and production of new products and expansion of sales and marketing efforts  changes in operating assets and liabilities  our ability to obtain debt financing and remain in compliance with the terms of the credit facility  our ability to raise funds from the sale of tower ordinary shares  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics 
furthermore  we may use our restricted cash to completely repay our outstanding debt with silicon valley bank 
we anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund anticipated operating losses  capital expenditures expected to be in excess of million during  the potential million investment in tower  and provide adequate working capital for the next months  although we could seek to raise additional capital during that period 
in addition  as our liquidity is affected by many factors as mentioned above and as discussed in our risk factors  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
after the next months  our capital and operating requirements will depend on many factors  including the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our level of revenue and gross profit  capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
capital lease amounts and other commercial commitment amounts are included as liabilities on our balance sheets as of december  the amount of restricted cash on our balance sheet is equal to our financial commitments under bank equipment and software notes payable and under bank revolving line of credit 
total less than year years and years and after years contractual cash obligations operating capital leases    investment in tower   wafer purchases total contractual cash obligations     other commercial commitments bank equipment and software notes payable   bank revolving line of credit   insurance credit facility total commercial commitments   inflation the impact of inflation on our business has not been material for the fiscal years ended december   and critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  expectations of future results  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our management believes that we consistently apply judgments and estimates and such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  actual results may differ from our estimates and the differences may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of investments  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from two sources the selling of fpga and esp products  and the sale of software licenses for our design tools 
software sales historically represent less than of our total revenue 
in both cases  management judgments and estimates must be made regarding returns  price adjustments and collectibility 
our fpgas and esps may be programmed by us  by our distributors  or by the end customers 
we sell to our distributors under agreements that  in the case of unprogrammed parts  allow certain rights of return and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
contractually  our distributors are permitted to return up to  by value  of the products they purchase from us every six months 
amounts billed to such distributors for shipments are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  and the related revenue and cost of revenue are deferred 
revenue is not recognized until the inventory is resold by the distributor 
revenue for programmed parts  which do not have similar return rights  as well as for all non distributor customers  is recognized upon shipment 
we estimate returns and distributor price adjustments and we assess whether or not collection is probable 
management analyzes historical returns  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  among other factors  when evaluating the adequacy of returns reserves and allowances 
material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may occur as a result of changes in facts or assumptions  or as a result of the use of estimates and judgment 
the provision for returns amounted to  as of december  software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of agreement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation or integration exist  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
because our software sales typically do not include any undelivered elements  and do not require support or maintenance  revenue from software sales is generally recognized at the time of delivery 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not generally request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
during this analysis we consider items such as manufacturing activity  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending  budgeted spending  and anticipated changes in the costs of services 
management estimates the collectibility of our accounts receivable at each reporting period 
management specifically analyzes the aging of accounts receivable and also analyzes historical bad debt  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions and market trends 
our analysis may take into consideration historic usage  expected demand  new product development schedules  product obsolescence  customer design activity  customer concentrations and other factors 
during  demand for our products declined precipitously and our arrangements with our suppliers caused us to purchase more inventory than we required 
during the second quarter of we established additional reserves for this excess inventory 
during the third quarter of we wrote down inventory by million  primarily due to the write down of two products to their net realizable value and due to the planned obsolescence of a product 
the introduction of a new product is expected to reduce demand for one of our current products 
market conditions are subject to change and forecast demand for our inventory may differ from actual consumption 
such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the lives of our products are unusually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor historically in the valuation of our inventories 
we also evaluate our inventory in light of its merchantability 
accordingly  we create reserves for inventory returned from our customers that has not been processed for resale and for new products that have not been qualified for shipment to our customers 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to reduce our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of investments 
we currently have a million investment in tower ordinary shares 
if the value of these shares were to decline below our carrying value  and if the decline is other than temporary  we would have an impairment charge against this investment 
as part of this investment  we hold  tower ordinary shares that are available for sale 
if the market price of these securities changes during a reporting period  and if this change is temporary  we would record a comprehensive gain or loss 
during the third quarter of and during the fourth quarter of  quicklogic wrote down the value of its equity investment in tower due to declines in value that were other than temporary 
this determination was made after the average market value of the tower stock  as quoted on the nasdaq national market  dropped below its carrying value for a significant period of time 
the tower shares purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
quicklogic reduced the carrying value for this asset to approximately per share at the end of the third quarter of  based on the market price of tower s stock at that time 
the tower shares purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
theses shares and the shares acquired in were reduced to a carrying value of per share at december   based on the market price of tower s common stock at that time 
the total amount of the write downs were million and million in and  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of or the expected cash flow from the acquired assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  significant negative economic events or trends affecting our business  a significant decline in our stock price  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and investments  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows  our appropriate discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital  and the fair value of long lived assets 
on august   quicklogic acquired certain assets of v  a toronto based manufacturer of assps  for a total of million 
this acquisition accelerated our esp strategy by strengthening our ability to develop and market system level products for our target market segments 
of the million purchase consideration  we allocated approximately million to the net assets acquired  and million to goodwill 
under sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment test on the goodwill on an annual basis  and when circumstances lead us to believe that an impairment has occurred 
as such  we completed an annual impairment analysis during the third quarter of fiscal  and determined that there was no impairment at that time  based on the results on an independent appraisal 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization  as implied by our stock price  dropped below our net asset value 
accordingly  we performed another impairment analysis  including an independent appraisal 
as a result of the analysis  we recorded a non cash charge of million 
the charge completely wrote off the goodwill amount on our balance sheet and was included as a component of operating income 
as the charge was non cash in nature  it did not affect our liquidity 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for a disposal activity  including those related to employee termination benefits and obligations under operating leases and order contracts  and that the liability be recognized when incurred and not necessarily on the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the initial measurement of a liability be based on fair value 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no

requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin no 
are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods ending after december  we have applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
risk factors in addition to other information in this k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this k  and the risks discussed in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  actual results could differ materially from our recent results or from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we may not have the liquidity to support our future capital requirements our cash balance at december  was million and our interest bearing debt  net of amounts supported by our restricted cash balance  was million 
we may be required to invest an additional million in tower in under the terms of our amended agreements if tower meets milestones related to the operation of the fabrication facility prior to july even if tower has not met the milestones  we may invest all or a portion of these funds under renegotiated terms 
other investments  which are largely driven by the capital expenditures for the introduction and initial manufacturing of new products  could exceed million in as a result these investments  as well as research and development  selling  marketing and administrative expenses  changes in working capital  and interest and debt payments  we will need to generate significantly higher revenue and gross profit to attain  and then maintain positive cash flow 
whether or when we can achieve cash flow levels sufficient to support our operations  and whether we will then be able to maintain positive cash flow  cannot be accurately predicted 
unless such cash flow levels are achieved  we may require additional borrowings or the sale of debt or equity securities  or some combination thereof  to provide funding for our operations 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  our financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected and we may not be able to operate our business without significant changes in our operations or at all 
we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability because we have a history of losses we incurred significant losses from our inception in through  and again in and our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
we had net loss of million in we cannot assure you that we will return to profitability in any future periods  and you should not rely on our historical revenue or our previous profitability as any indication of our future operating results or prospects 
our future results depend on our relationship with tower we have devoted significant resources to our relationship with tower  and through december   we have invested approximately million toward the completion of its wafer foundry facility 
our final payment to tower of million was initially due to tower in november upon the achievement of operational milestones related to its fabrication facility 
tower has not yet satisfied the performance milestones  and we are not yet manufacturing any of our products at tower 
we believe that tower s completion of this fabrication facility depends on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry equipment and foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israel government s investment center 
the current political uncertainty and security situation in the middle east  the market for foundry manufacturing services  the early stage of operation of tower s fabrication facility  tower s financial condition  or other factors may adversely impact tower s business prospects and may discourage investments in tower from outside sources 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry construction in a timely manner or successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies and our process technology  and ramp up production  the value of our investment in tower will decline significantly or possibly become worthless and we would have to identify and qualify a substitute supplier to manufacture our products 
this would require significant development time  would cause product shipment delays and would severely harm our business 
in addition  the value of our investment in tower and its corresponding wafer credits may be adversely affected by a further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further or the wafer credits are deemed to be impaired  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
our final payment to tower under the share purchase agreement may become due during if tower meets milestones related to the operation of the fabrication facility prior to july even if tower has not met the milestones  we may invest all or a portion of these funds under renegotiated terms 
if the terms of this final installment are not renegotiated prior to our payment  we may incur a loss on the shares purchased 
if our share price falls below  we could be delisted from the nasdaq national market the minimum per share bid price required under market place rule a to maintain a listing on the nasdaq national market is 
our common stock closed as low as during a delisting could impair our ability to raise additional working capital 
if we are able to raise additional capital  the terms may not be favorable and your investment may be diluted 
furthermore  because prices for delisted stock are often not publicly available  a delisting would impair the liquidity of our common stock and make it difficult for you to sell your shares  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one manufacturer  which exposes us to the risk of having to identify and qualify one or more substitute suppliers we depend upon independent third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one manufacturer 
we have contractual arrangements with two of our three foundry manufacturers of semiconductors  tower and cypress  to provide us with specified manufacturing capacity 
the tower facility is not yet operational 
we purchase product from tsmc on a purchase order basis 
our assembly and test work is also done on a purchase order basis 
if we are unable to secure adequate manufacturing capacity from tower  tsmc  cypress or other suppliers to meet our supply requirements  our business will be materially harmed 
processes used to manufacture our products are complex  customized to our specifications and can only be performed by a limited number of manufacturing facilities 
if our current manufacturing suppliers were unable or unwilling to provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity  we would have to identify and qualify one or more substitute suppliers to manufacture our products  and most likely redesign our products to be manufactured at the new facility 
our manufacturers may experience unanticipated events  such as the september taiwan earthquake  that could inhibit their abilities to use our inventory or provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity on a timely basis  or at all 
our suppliers may be unable to generate the funds needed to continue operations  or to maintain required service or quality levels 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer would require significant development time to adapt our designs and intellectual property to their manufacturing processes and could cause product shipment delays and delays in new product introductions 
in addition  our inventory may become damaged or difficult to access  the costs associated with manufacturing our products may increase  and our customers may have to re qualify our product in applications  if we are required to use a new third party manufacturer 
if we fail to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  our business would be materially harmed 
our future operating results are likely to fluctuate and therefore may fail to meet expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline our operating results have varied widely in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in addition  our operating results may not follow any past trends 
our future operating results will depend on many factors and may fail to meet our expectations for a number of reasons  including those set forth in these risk factors 
any failure to meet expectations could cause our stock price to significantly fluctuate or decline 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that relate to our internal operations include successful execution of our strategy to develop and market embedded system products and fpgas  changes in our product mix or pricing  our inability to adjust our fixed costs in the face of any declines in revenue or gross profit  our ability to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to competitive product or pricing pressure  our inventory levels  changes in inventory value and product obsolescence  and our ability to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to competitive product or pricing pressure 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that depend upon our suppliers and customers include the timing of significant product orders  order cancellations and reschedulings  the availability of production capacity and fluctuations in the manufacturing yields at the facilities that manufacture our devices  the financial resources of our suppliers and their ability to provide capacity  invest in new technologies  use our inventory  provide appropriate quality and customer service levels  and the cost of raw materials and manufacturing services from our suppliers 
factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate that are industry risks include intense competitive pricing pressures  introductions of or enhancements to our competitors products  and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
other factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include general economic  market  political and social conditions in the countries where we sell our products  adverse movements in exchange rates  interest rates  or tax rates  our ability to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  our ability to raise the capital required to finance our losses and expected investments  and litigation or potential litigation settlement provisions or expenses 
our day to day business decisions are made with these factors in mind 
although certain of these factors are out of our immediate control  unless we can anticipate  and be prepared with contingency plans that respond to these factors  we will be unsuccessful in carrying out our business plan 
a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline as of february  four stockholders and their affiliates held approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if our current stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  the market price of our common stock could fall 
for instance  since september  one stockholder has sold of our outstanding common stock 
such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
if we fail to successfully develop  introduce and sell new products  we may be unable to compete effectively in the future we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance  new features  reliability and or cost savings to our customers 
if any of the following occur  our business will be materially harmed we fail to complete and introduce new product designs in a timely manner  we are unable to have these new products manufactured according to design specifications  our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products  our sales force and independent distributors do not create adequate demand for our products  these products fail to generate sufficient gross profit  or market demand for our new products  such as esps  does not develop as anticipated 
we have only introduced a limited number of esp product families  therefore  we cannot accurately predict their future level of acceptance by our customers  and we may not be able to generate anticipated revenue from esp products we introduced our first esp product family  quickram  in  and followed this with our quickpci  v and quickmips esp families 
in  esps accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we do not know the extent to which systems manufacturers will purchase or utilize our esps 
since we anticipate that esps will become an increasingly larger component of our business  our failure to design  develop  manufacture and sell new esp products  or their failure to continue to gain acceptance with customers  would materially harm our business 
we cannot assure you that our esps will be commercially successful or that these products will result in significant additional revenue or improved operating margins in future periods 
we expend substantial resources in developing and selling our products  and we may be unable to generate significant revenue as a result of these efforts to establish market acceptance of our products  we must dedicate significant resources to research and development  production and sales and marketing 
we experience a long delay between the time when we expend these resources and the time when we begin to generate revenue  if any  from these expenditures 
typically  this delay is one year or more 
we generally record as expenses the costs related to the development of new semiconductor products and software as these expenses are incurred 
as a result  our profitability from quarter to quarter and from year to year may be materially and adversely affected by the number and timing of our new product introductions in any period and the level of acceptance gained by these products 
if we fail to comply with the covenants of credit facilities our financial condition could suffer we currently have a million credit facility with silicon valley bank and expect to operate with credit facilities in the future 
these facilities often require that we meet certain financial covenants 
our current facility includes an obligation to maintain a tangible net worth of million and an obligation to maintain million of cash and investment balances with silicon valley bank 
we notified the bank that we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant as of october and november  and that we expected to be out of compliance in december and march the bank waived the covenant for the october period and advanced funds to us in december 
we were  as expected  not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant at december  and received a waiver from the bank 
we do not expect to be in compliance with the covenant at the end of our first fiscal quarter 
as a result  we have classified the entire amount outstanding as a short term obligation 
we are negotiating a restructured credit facility with the bank  and expect to complete these negotiations or obtain a new facility by may if we are unable to complete this negotiation or obtain new credit on commercially reasonable terms we may need to use our restricted cash to repay amounts outstanding  and as a result  our financial results and business would suffer 
as of december  we had million outstanding under this facility 
our customers may cancel or change their product plans after we have expended substantial time and resources in the design of their products if one of our potential customers cancels  reduces or delays product orders from us or chooses not to release equipment that incorporates our products after we have spent substantial time and resources in designing a product  our business could be materially harmed 
our customers often evaluate our products for six to twelve months or more before designing them into their systems  and they may not commence volume shipments for up to an additional six to twelve months  if at all 
during this lengthy sales cycle  our potential customers may also cancel or change their product plans 
even when customers incorporate one or more of our products into their systems  they may ultimately discontinue the shipment of their systems that incorporate our products 
the customers whose products achieve high volume production may choose to replace our products with lower cost semiconductors 
we will be unable to compete effectively if we fail to anticipate product opportunities based upon emerging technologies and standards and fail to develop products that incorporate these technologies and standards we may spend significant time and money on research and development to design and develop products around an industry standard or emerging technology 
to date  we have introduced product families  such as quickpci  that are designed to support a specific industry standard 
if an industry standard or emerging technology that we have identified fails to achieve broad market acceptance in our target markets  or if we are unable to bring the technology to market in a timely manner  we may be unable to generate significant revenue from our research and development efforts 
moreover  even if we are able to develop products using adopted standards  our products may not be accepted in our target markets 
as a result  our business would be materially harmed 
we have limited experience in designing and developing products that support industry standards 
if systems manufacturers move away from the use of industry standards that we support with our products and adopt alternative standards  we may be unable to design and develop new products that conform to these new standards 
the expertise required is unique to each industry standard  and we would have to either hire individuals with the required expertise or acquire such expertise through a licensing arrangement or by other means 
the demand for individuals with the necessary expertise to develop a product relating to a particular industry standard is generally high  and we may not be able to hire such individuals 
the cost to acquire such expertise through licensing or other means may be high and such arrangements may not be possible in a timely manner  if at all 
we may encounter periods of industry wide semiconductor oversupply  resulting in pricing pressure and underutilization of manufacturing capacity  as well as undersupply  resulting in a risk that we could be unable to fulfill our customers requirements the semiconductor industry has historically been characterized by wide fluctuations in the demand for  and supply of  its products 
these fluctuations have resulted in circumstances when supply and demand for the industry s products have been widely out of balance 
our operating results may be materially harmed by industry wide semiconductor oversupply  which could result in severe pricing pressure and under utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
in a market with undersupply  we would have to compete with larger foundry customers for limited manufacturing capacity 
in such an environment  we may be unable to have our products manufactured in a timely manner or at the costs or in quantities necessary to meet our requirements 
since we outsource all of our manufacturing  we are particularly vulnerable to such supply shortages 
as a result  we may be unable to fulfill orders and may lose customers 
any future industry wide oversupply or undersupply of semiconductors would materially harm our business 
if we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products  we may incur product shortages or excess product inventory our agreements with third party manufacturers require us to provide forecasts of our anticipated manufacturing orders  and place binding manufacturing orders in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers 
this may result in product shortages or excess product inventory because we are limited in our ability to increase or decrease our rolling forecasts under such agreements 
obtaining additional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or not possible  especially in the short term 
our failure to adequately forecast demand for our products would materially harm our business 
fluctuations in our product yields  especially our new products  may increase the costs of our manufacturing process difficulties in the complex semiconductor manufacturing process can render a substantial percentage of semiconductor wafers nonfunctional 
we have  in the past  experienced manufacturing runs that have contained substantially reduced or no functioning devices 
varying degrees of these yield reductions occur frequently in our manufacturing process 
these yield reductions  which can occur without warning  may result in substantially higher manufacturing costs and inventory shortages to us 
we may experience yield problems in the future that may materially harm our business 
in addition  yield problems may take a significant period of time to analyze and correct 
our reliance on third party suppliers may extend the period of time required to analyze and correct these problems 
as a result  if we experience higher costs or are unable to respond rapidly to market demand  our business would suffer 
yield reductions frequently occur in connection with the manufacture of newly introduced products or with manufacturing at new facilities or on new manufacturing processes 
newly introduced products  such as our eclipse family of fpgas  are often more complex and more difficult to produce  increasing the risk of manufacturing related defects 
new manufacturing facilities or processes  such as our expected production at tower  are often more complex and take a period of time to refine procedures to achieve expected service levels  quality levels and product costs 
while we test our products  these products may still contain errors or defects that we find only after we have commenced commercial production 
our customers may not place new orders for our products if the products have reliability problems  which would materially harm our business 
we may be unable to grow our business if the markets in which our customers sell their products do not grow our success depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets that use our products 
any decline in the demand for our products in the following markets could materially harm our business high performance computing  instrumentation and test  data communications and telecommunications  video audio  graphics and imaging  or military and aerospace systems 
slower growth in any of the other markets in which our products are sold may also materially harm our business 
many of these markets are characterized by rapid technological change and intense competition 
as a result  systems sold by our customers that use our products may face severe price competition  become obsolete over a short time period  or fail to gain market acceptance 
any of these occurrences would materially harm our business 
we depend upon third party distributors to market and sell our products  and they may discontinue sale of our products  fail to give our products priority or be unable to successfully market  sell and support our products we employ independent  third party distributors to market and sell a significant portion of our products 
during  approximately of our sales were made through our distributors 
five distributors accounted for approximately of our sales 
although we have contracts with our distributors  any of them may terminate their relationship with us on short notice 
the loss of one or more of our principal distributors  or our inability to attract new distributors  could materially harm our business 
we may lose distributors in the future and we may be unable to recruit additional or replacement distributors 
as a result  our future performance will depend in part on our ability to retain our existing distributors and attract new distributors that will be able to market  sell and support our products effectively 
many of our distributors  including our principal distributors  market and sell products for other companies  and many of these products may compete directly or indirectly with our products 
we generally are not one of the principal suppliers of products to our distributors 
if our distributors give higher priority or greater attention to the products of other companies  including products that compete with our products  our business would be materially harmed 
we may be unable to accurately estimate quarterly results  which could adversely affect the trading price of our stock since we generally recognize revenue from sales to our distributors when these distributors make sales to customers  we are highly dependent on the accuracy and timeliness of their resale and inventory reports 
inaccurate distributor resale or inventory reports contribute to our difficulty in predicting and reporting our quarterly revenue and results of operations  particularly in the last month of the quarter 
in addition  we offer our customers a short delivery lead time  and to of our shipments during a quarter may be ordered that quarter 
as a result  we often have low visibility of current quarter revenue  and our revenue level can change significantly in a short period of time 
if we fail to accurately predict our revenue and results of operations on a quarterly basis  our results of operations could be harmed and our stock price could materially fluctuate 
customers may cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors may return our products  which would cause our inventory levels to increase and our revenue to decline during the fourth quarter of one customer  purchasing product though a distributor  accounted for of our revenue in the quarter 
this customer is expected to contribute significant revenue through the middle of the cancellation or deferral of purchase orders from this customer or other significant customers would materially harm our business 
we sell our products on a purchase order basis through our distributors and direct sales channels  and our distributors or customers may cancel purchase orders at any time with little or no penalty 
in addition  our distributor agreements generally permit our distributors to return un programmed products to us 
contractually  our distributors are permitted to return up to  by value  of the products they purchase from us every six months 
if our distributors or customers cancel or defer significant purchase orders or our distributors or customers return our products  our accounts receivable collections would decrease and our inventories would increase  which would materially harm our business 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling to switch to our products because of their familiarity with the products offered by our direct competitors  such as xilinx and altera  which dominate the programmable logic market the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by erosion of selling prices over product lives  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  and strong domestic and foreign competition 
if we are not able to compete successfully in this environment  our business will be materially harmed 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution  name recognition and other resources than we do 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of system applications 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including re programmability  lower prices and other competitive factors not matched by us 
our current direct competitors include suppliers of complex programmable logic devices and field programmable gate arrays  such as xilinx  altera  actel  and lattice semiconductor 
xilinx and altera together have a majority share of the programmable logic market 
many systems manufacturers may be unwilling or unable to switch to our products due to their familiarity with competitors products or other inhibiting factors 
we also face competition from companies that offer asics  which may be obtained at lower costs for higher volumes and typically have greater logic capacity  additional features and higher performance than those of our products 
we may also face competition from suppliers of embedded microprocessors  such as idt and motorola  or from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
our inability to successfully compete in any of the following areas could materially harm our business the development of new products and manufacturing technologies  the quality  price and availability of products  devices  hardware and software and development tools  the diversity of product lines  or the quality and cost effectiveness of design  development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
we may be unable to successfully grow our business if we fail to compete effectively with others to attract and retain key personnel we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
our employees are at will and not subject to employment contracts 
hiring and retaining qualified sales and technical personnel is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals 
competition for these types of employees is intense 
in addition  new hires frequently require extensive training before they achieve desired levels of productivity 
we have in the past experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified senior management  sales and technical personnel 
in  our vice president of worldwide marketing  peter feist  resigned 
failure to attract  hire  train and retain personnel  particularly senior management  sales and technical personnel  would materially harm our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  and may face significant expenses as a result of future litigation protection of intellectual property rights is crucial to our business  since that is how we keep others from copying the innovations that are central to our existing and future products 
from time to time  we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to take a license to other parties patents 
we evaluate these letters on a case by case basis 
these situations may lead to litigation if we reject the offer to obtain the license 
we have in the past and may again become involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others patents or other intellectual property rights 
this kind of litigation is expensive and consumes large amounts of management s time and attention 
for example  we incurred substantial costs associated with the litigation and settlement of our dispute with actel  which materially harmed our business 
in addition  if the letters we sometimes receive alleging patent infringement or other similar matters result in litigation that we lose  a court could order us to pay substantial damages and or royalties  and prohibit us from making  using  selling or importing essential technologies 
for these and other reasons  this kind of litigation would materially harm our business 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us  we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
we have entered into technology license agreements with third parties which give those parties the right to use patents and other technology developed by us  and which give us the right to use patents and other technology developed by them 
we anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future  however  it is possible that desirable licenses will not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
if we lose existing licenses to key technology  or are unable to enter into new licenses that we deem important  it could materially harm our business 
because it is critical to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations  we intend to continue to seek patent and trade secret protection for our products 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  even if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
however  employees may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in any case  others may come to know about or determine our trade secrets through a variety of methods 
in addition  the laws of certain territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
problems associated with international business operations could affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products most of our products are manufactured outside of the united states at manufacturing facilities operated by our suppliers in taiwan  south korea and the philippines  and we plan to use facilities in israel and malaysia during we expect to manufacture a majority of the products that we have under development in israel and to assemble these products in south korea  the philippines or malaysia 
as a result  our manufacturing operations and new product introductions are subject to risks of political instability  including the risk of conflict between taiwan and the people s republic of china and conflict between north korea and south korea  and conflicts involving israel or malaysia 
sales to customers located outside the united states accounted for  and of our total sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that sales to customers located outside the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in future periods and the trend of foreign customers accounting for an increasing portion of our total sales may continue 
in addition  most of our domestic customers sell their products outside of north america  thereby indirectly exposing us to risks associated with foreign commerce 
asian economic instability could also materially and adversely affect our business  particularly to the extent that this instability impacts the sales of products manufactured by our customers 
in addition to overseas sales offices  we have significant research and development activities in canada and india 
foreign research and development activities accounted for of our research and development expenses in accordingly  our operations and revenue are subject to a number of risks associated with foreign commerce  including the following managing foreign distributors  staffing and managing foreign offices  political and economic instability  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in tax laws  tariffs and freight rates  timing and availability of export licenses  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  and obtaining governmental approvals for certain products 
in the past we have denominated sales of our products in foreign countries exclusively in us dollars 
as a result  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of a foreign country will increase the price of our products in that country so that our products become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of that foreign country 
as a result  sales of our products in that foreign country may decline 
to the extent any such risks materialize  our business would be materially harmed 
in addition  we may incur costs that are difficult to reduce quickly because of employee related laws and practices in foreign countries 
we may engage in manufacturing or technology agreements that involve numerous risks  including the use of cash  diversion of resources and significant write offs in the past  we have engaged in agreements that committed the company to significant use of cash  management time and other personnel resources 
for instance  we have licensed certain microprocessor technology from mips technologies and obtained other elements of our products from companies 
we plan to use these elements in products that we expect to manufacture at tower s fabrication facility 
agreements such as these have involved numerous risks  including the use of significant amounts of our cash  diversion of the attention of employees from other development projects or market opportunities  significant expenses  our ability to utilize the technology in our products or to introduce products in a cost effective and timely manner  and market acceptance of related products 
our current agreements and future agreements entail similar risks 
if we fail to recover  or if in our judgment we will not recover  these assets from the gross profits of the related products our assets will become impaired  or we may decide to write down these investments for other reasons  and our financial results would be harmed 
we cannot be certain that these third party elements will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the loss of  or inability to use or maintain  such elements could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent design elements or software is developed internally or identified  licensed from a third party  and integrated into our products  which would seriously harm our business 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  terrorist acts and other events beyond our control 
in particular  our headquarters are located near earthquake fault lines in the san francisco bay area and may be susceptible to the risk of earthquakes 
if there is an earthquake in the region  our business could be seriously harmed 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers to manufacture our products 
these suppliers often hold significant inventory of quicklogic product and  in the event of a disaster or other loss of supply  our ability to use this inventory and to move production to new suppliers may significantly impact quicklogic resources for several quarters 
we may also be adversely affected by business interruptions at systems manufacturers 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects our products are complex and may contain undetected or unresolved defects when first introduced  as new intellectual property is incorporated into our products  as a result of changes in the manufacturing process  or as new versions are released 
we cannot assure you that  despite our testing  defects will not be found in our products following commercial release 
if our products do contain undetected or unresolved defects  we may lose market share  experience delays in or losses of market acceptance or be required to issue a product recall 
in addition  we would be at risk of product liability litigation for financial or other damages to our customers because of defects in our products 
although we attempt to limit our liability to end users through disclaimers of special  consequential and indirect damages and similar provisions  we cannot assure you that such limitations of liability will be legally enforceable 
our principal stockholders have significant voting power and may vote for actions that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders our officers  directors and principal stockholders together control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  will be able to significantly influence the management and affairs of quicklogic and all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might affect the market price of our common stock 
this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interest of our other stockholders 
our shareholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a takeover our shareholder rights plan as well as provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders
