materially different amounts could be reported under different circumstances and conditions 
revenue revenue is recognized when earned 
the company generally recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment and in certain circumstances upon acceptance by the customers 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence in  due to a prolonged slow down in spending by telecommunication providers  inventory turnover has slowed 
the company recorded charges of million and

in making such a determination  the company considers its current and past performance  the market environment in which it operates  estimated future earnings  tax planning strategies and other factors 
in the future  as these factors change  a change in the valuation reserve may be required 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the company s pension plan assets have earned in excess of  therefore  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of gains losses are amortized to expense in accordance with sfas no 
the plan assets earned a rate of return substantially less than the assumed rate of return in and should this trend continue  future pension expense will likely increase

at december   the company used a rate of 
changes in discount rates over the past three years have not materially affected pension income expense  and the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  have been deferred as allowed by sfas no 
other post employment benefits the company provides retiree health benefits for domestic employees who retired prior to march  under its pension plan 
various actuarial assumptions including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs are used to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for the retiree health plan

certain factors that may affect future results from time to time  information provided by the company  statements made by its employees or information included in its filings with the securities and exchange commission including this form k may contain statements which are not historical facts  so called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual future results may differ significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to product demand fluctuations in the timing and volume of customer requests for its products 
telecommunication systems industry and general economic conditions 
competitive pressure on selling prices 
market acceptance of the company s products and its customer s products and services 
costs associated with possible litigation or settlement  including those related to the use or ownership of intellectual property 
loss of a major customer 
a few customers account for a major portion of the company sales 
a loss of such a customer would have a major adverse impact on the company s results 
third party suppliers increase the risk that the company may not have adequate supply to meet demand 
introduction of new products 
the company s markets are subject to technological change  so its success depends on its ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive 
some of its competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources 
the company s future success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain key design engineering  sales and executive personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel  in particular  design engineers  and the company may not be able to attract and retain engineers and other qualified personnel necessary for the development and introduction of new products or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel that may leave its employ 
expense levels  in the short term  are fixed 
sales variances from quarter to quarter would have a significant effect on the results of operations 
other risk factors detailed in this annual report on form k and in the company s other securities and exchange commission filings 
item a market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities
