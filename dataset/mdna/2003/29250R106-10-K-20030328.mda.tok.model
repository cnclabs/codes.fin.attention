item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
environmental and safety regulation general the partnership s transmission and gathering pipelines and storage and processing facilities are subject to extensive federal and state environmental  operational and safety regulation 
many federal and state agencies are authorized by statute to issue and have issued a variety of rules and regulations that are binding on the pipeline and other activities of the partnership 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and or enforcement actions 
the regulatory burden on the pipeline and operational activities increases the partnership s cost of doing business and  consequently  affects its profitability 
however  the partnership does not believe that it is affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than its competitors 
due to the myriad and complex federal and state statutes and regulations that may affect the partnership  directly or indirectly  the following discussion of certain statutes and regulations should not be considered an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting the partnership s operations 
pipeline safety and transportation regulation the partnership s transmission and non rural gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the us dot  under the title united states code pipeline safety act psa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of transmission and non rural gathering pipeline facilities 
the psa requires pipeline operators to comply with regulations issued pursuant to the psa  to permit access to and allow copying of pipeline records  and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
on december  the pipeline safety improvement act of act was signed into legislation amending the psa in several important respects 
the psa is subject to periodic reauthorization and the december legislation reauthorizes the psa through the act requires the dot to issue regulations requiring natural gas pipeline operators to establish written integrity management plans for pipeline segments in high consequence areas  including a mandate to complete baseline integrity testing of such segments within ten years and at intervals of every seven years thereafter 
the dot is also mandated to establish criteria for assuring that pipeline companies conduct a worker qualification program and conduct a pilot study on the feasibility of the dot certification of pipeline control center operators 
the dot was also granted broader authority to involve states in assuring compliance with federal rules  increased enforcement authority and issue higher penalties for non compliance 
the act also requires pipeline operators to submit electronic maps to the dot  develop and evaluate public awareness plans  refrain from retaliation if workers alert authorities to safety concerns  cooperate with investigations of incidents or face penalties  along with several other mandates 
following previous mandates in the psa  the dot has issued a number of amendments to pipeline safety regulations 
effective april   operators of regulated natural gas and liquids pipeline facilities must have a written operator qualification program 
after october   all employees performing covered tasks on these pipeline facilities must be qualified under this written program 
effective march   operators of hazardous liquid pipelines subject to the regulations are required to assess  evaluate  repair and validate through a comprehensive analysis the integrity of hazardous liquid pipeline segments that  in the event of a leak or failure  could effect a high consequence areas defined as populated areas  areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage or commercially navigable waterways 
the dot regulations require the integrity testing of hazardous liquid pipelines in high consequence areas through internal inspection  hydrostatic testing or other equally effective assessment means 
on january   the dot proposed similar rules requiring development of integrity management plans and integrity testing of natural gas pipelines in high consequence areas 
the definition of high consequence areas for natural gas pipelines is focused on places of high population  nearby buildings of persons of limited mobility or places of congregation 
natural gas pipelines in such areas will have ten years to complete integrity testing and must undergo a prescribed future interval of integrity testing 
final rules are expected to be issued by mid the dot has proposed or has announced intentions to propose additional regulations requiring annual reports for liquid pipelines  revised standards for public awareness plans by pipeline operators and is evaluating the need to regulate all gathering pipelines rather than non rural gathering lines currently under the jurisdiction of the psa 
pending specific proposed regulations  the partnership is not certain of the effect or costs new requirements may have on its operations 
although states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating the design  operation and safety of interstate pipelines  some states have assumed responsibility for enforcing federal pipeline regulations and have established a program of regulating and inspecting intrastate pipelines 
specifically in texas  effective february   operators of intrastate transmission and non rural gathering lines are required to have an integrity assessment and management program in place which requires a prescriptive plan for pressure tests or an operator developed risk based plan that uses a combination of risk analysis  hydrostatic testing or internal inspections and appropriate risk remedial actions 
management is not aware at this time how the proposed new dot regulations on integrity management will affect the requirements of the texas regulations  if at all 
under the homeland security act passed by congress in  the dot s transportation safety agency  who now has oversight over pipeline security  will be transferred to the newly establish department of homeland security 
it is expected that the dot and homeland security will enter into a memorandum of understanding  thus that the dot will retain inspection authority over pipeline security plans and potential new federal regulations 
the partnership s trucking and railcar operations are also subject to safety and permitting regulation by the dot and state agencies with regard to the safe transportation of hazardous materials and other materials 
the partnership believes that its pipeline  trucking and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements 
nevertheless  significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of its current pipeline control system or other safety equipment 
environmental regulation general 
the partnership s operations are subject to complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations which govern the handling  storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas compression facilities 
as with the pipeline and processing industry in general  complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases the overall cost of doing business  including its capital costs to construct  maintain  and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect its maintenance capital expenditures and net income  the partnership believes that they do not affect its competitive position since the operations of its competitors are similarly affected 
in addition to compliance costs  violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
the partnership believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change at the federal  state and local levels  and the clear trend is to place increasingly stringent limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
therefore  the partnership is unable to predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations or their future impact on its operations 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with the partnership s operations  such as leaks or spills of crude oil  liquids or natural gas or other substances from its pipelines or storage facilities 
such accidental releases could  to the extent not insured  subject the partnership to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines or penalties for any related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
although the partnership is entitled in certain circumstances to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets that it acquired from those parties  these contractual indemnification rights are limited and  accordingly  the partnership may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses 
enbridge management has managerial control over the operations of the partnership 
the partnership is primarily responsible for performing duties imposed under environmental laws  such as obligations to clean up hydrocarbons or other materials that are released into the environment 
however  to the extent that the partnership incurs but does not perform or complete obligations imposed under environmental laws  enbridge management may be held liable for the costs and liabilities arising from those obligations as the party with managerial control over the operations of the partnership 
air emissions 
the partnership s operations are subject to the federal caa and comparable state and local statutes 
these laws generally require facilities that emit air contaminants into the atmosphere to implement or achieve certain technological or performance based emissions controls and to comply with various permitting  monitoring and reporting regulations 
amendments to the caa enacted in  as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans implementing those amendments  require or will require most industrial operations in the united states to make capital expenditures in order to meet new air emission control standards developed by the us epa  and state environmental agencies 
as a result of these amendments  the partnership s facilities are subject to increasingly stringent air emissions regulations  including requirements that some facilities install maximum or best achievable control technologies to reduce or eliminate regulated emissions 
a number of the partnership s facilities are currently exempt from these air emissions regulations due to their age 
over the next several years  however  the exemptions for such grandfathered facilities are due to expire 
the partnership anticipates  therefore  that it will incur certain capital expenses in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permits and approvals for any new or acquired facilities 
for example  the partnership estimates it will incur up to million in capital expenditures to upgrade its air pollution control equipment at the tilden gas plant on the south texas system 
in addition  state and local air quality regulations can be more stringent than federal regulations in some circumstances  particularly in areas where national air quality standards have not been achieved 
although the partnership can give no assurances  it believes compliance with these caa requirements will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations and that such requirements do not affect its competitive position since the operations of its competitors are similarly affected 
hazardous substances and waste management 
the federal cercla also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws  impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons  including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment at such disposal sites and to seek recovery of the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons 
although petroleum is currently excluded from cercla s definition of a hazardous substance  in the course of its ordinary operations the partnership may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
the partnership may  therefore  be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than cercla and  in some instances  may offer fewer exemptions from liability 
the partnership has not received any notification that it may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under cercla or similar state laws 
the partnership s operations also generate both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the federal rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the partnership is not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of rcra s requirements as its operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
from time to time  however  the epa has considered making changes in nonhazardous waste standards that would result in stricter disposal requirements for these wastes  including certain petroleum wastes 
furthermore  it is possible that some of the wastes the partnership generates that are currently classified as nonhazardous may in the future be reclassified as hazardous wastes  which would trigger more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
in addition  analogous state and local laws may impose more stringent waste disposal requirements or apply to a broader range of wastes 
while federal or state regulatory changes could result in an increase in the partnership s maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses  the partnership believes that they would not effect its competitive position since the operations of its competitors would be similarly affected 
water 
the cwa and similar state laws place strict limits on the discharge of contaminants into federal and state waters 
regulations under these laws prohibit such discharges unless authorized by and in compliance with a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit or an equivalent state permit 
the cwa and analogous state laws allow significant penalty assessments for unauthorized releases of water pollution and impose substantial liability for the costs of cleaning up spills and leaks into the water 
in addition  the cwa and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of stormwater runoff from certain types of facilities 
state laws may also place restrictions and cleanup requirements on the release of pollution into groundwater 
the partnership believes that it will be able to obtain  or be covered under  any required cwa permits and that compliance with the conditions of those permits will not have a material effect on its operations 
the opa was enacted in and amends parts of the cwa and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills 
under the opa  the partnership could be subject to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from its facilities into navigable waters  along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the united states 
the opa also imposes certain spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements for many of the partnership s non pipeline facilities  such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or leak 
for the partnership s pipeline facilities  the opa imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared  submitted and approved by the dot 
the partnership believes it is in material compliance with these laws and promulgating regulations 
employee health and safety 
the workplaces associated with the partnership operations are subject to the requirements of the federal osha and comparable state statutes that regulate worker health and safety 
in addition  some states have received authorization to implement their own occupational safety and health programs in lieu of the federal program 
the partnership has an ongoing safety training program for its employees and believes that its operations are in material compliance with applicable occupational health and safety requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements  monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances  and hazard communication standards 
site remediation 
the partnership owns and operates a number of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport  distribute  store and process crude oil  natural gas and other petroleum products for many years 
certain facilities  including the lakehead system  have been operated by the partnership or its predecessors for more than years 
many of the other facilities of the partnership were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling  disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under the partnership s control 
the age of the facilities combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices  which were standard for the industry at the time  have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases 
such contamination is not unusual within the petroleum industry 
any historical contamination found on  under or originating from the partnership s properties may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as described above 
under these laws  the partnership could incur substantial expense to remediate any such contamination  including contamination caused by prior owners and operators 
in addition  enbridge management  as the entity with managerial responsibility for the partnership  could also be liable for such costs to the extent that the partnership is unable to fulfill its obligations 
the partnership has conducted site investigations at some of its facilities to assess historical environmental issues  and it is currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs  with oversight by the applicable government agencies where appropriate 
most of the environmental site investigations of the partnership s facilities were performed in connection with the acquisition of assets from third parties 
environmental liabilities identified in these investigations were handled in several ways 
in some instances  historical environmental liabilities were assumed upon the acquisition of assets 
in connection with one acquisition  the partnership has been advised that the total cost to remediate environmental contamination at several sites on the northeast texas system is estimated to be approximately million 
in other circumstances  assets were acquired subject to indemnities from the sellers which are intended to protect the partnership from specific historical environmental liabilities 
there are also instances where only parts of assets were acquired  leaving the seller with the portions believed to be more severely affected by historical environmental liabilities 
in connection with the partnership s acquisition of the midcoast system  northeast texas and south texas systems under the contribution agreement  the general partner has agreed to indemnify the partnership and other related persons for certain environmental liabilities of which the general partner has knowledge but  did not disclose under the contribution agreement 
the general partner will not be required to indemnify the partnership under the contribution agreement until the aggregate liabilities  including environmental liabilities  exceed million  and the general partner s aggregate liability under the contribution agreement  including environmental liabilities  may not exceed  with certain exceptions  million 
the partnership will be liable for any environmental conditions related to the acquired systems that were not known to the general partner or were disclosed under the contribution agreement 
in addition  the partnership will be liable for all removal  remediation and disposal of all asbestos containing materials and all naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with the northeast texas system and for which the general partner is liable to the prior owner of that system 
although the partnership believes these indemnities and carve outs provide valuable protection  it is possible that the sellers from whom these assets were purchased will not be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations or their remedial obligations related to retained liabilities or properties 
in this case  it is possible that governmental agencies or third party claimants could assert that the partnership may be liable or bears some responsibility for such obligations 
the partnership could also experience future spills or releases from its pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities  or trucking or rail operations  or it could discover historical releases that were previously unidentified 
to guard against these risks  the partnership maintains an extensive inspection and maintenance program designed to prevent  detect and address such releases promptly  and it has obtained insurance policies designed to provide additional protection against unknown historical environmental liabilities related to certain assets  including the northeast texas and east texas systems 
the partnership could nevertheless incur significant penalties  damages and remedial liabilities arising from future spills or the discovery of previously unknown historical releases 
such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
employees the partnership  nor enbridge management  has any employees 
the general partner has delegated to enbridge management  pursuant to the delegation of control agreement  substantially all of the responsibility for the day to day management and operation of the partnership 
the general partner  however  retains  certain functions and approval rights over the operations of the partnership 
to fulfill the management obligations  enbridge management has entered into agreements with enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide enbridge management with the necessary services and support personnel  who will act on enbridge management s behalf as its agents 
the partnership is ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services 
insurance the operations of the partnership are subject to many hazards inherent in the liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  processing and transmission industry 
the partnership maintains insurance coverage for its operations and properties considered to be customary in the industry 
there can be no assurance  however that insurance coverages maintained by the partnership will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss or that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable 
although management believes that the assets of the partnership are adequately covered by insurance  a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
capital expenditures in  the partnership made capital expenditures of million  of which million was for pipeline system enhancements  million for core maintenance activities and million for the terrace expansion program 
these amounts do not include the acquisition costs for the midcoast system 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
taxation for us federal and state income tax purposes  the partnership is not a taxable entity 
federal and state income taxes on partnership taxable income are borne by the individual partners through the allocation of partnership taxable income 
such taxable income may vary substantially from net income reported in the statement of income 
other matters in october  the partnership acquired the midcoast  northeast texas  and south texas systems from the general partner the acquisition 
a committee of independent members of the board of directors of the general partner negotiated the purchase price and terms of the acquisition on behalf of the partnership s public unitholders and recommended that the board approve the acquisition 
the independent committee retained their own expert financial and legal advisors to assist in this process and the financial advisor rendered a fairness opinion in connection with the acquisition 
in november  the staff of the sec advised the partnership  enbridge management  the general partner and enbridge the enbridge group  that they had commenced an informal inquiry into the acquisition and the initial public offering by enbridge management 
the sec staff has advised the partnership that their principal focus includes the financial forecast made in connection with the acquisition and the price paid for the assets 
the sec staff has not asserted that the partnership or the other enbridge entities has acted improperly or illegally  and it has not indicated an intention to seek a formal order of investigation 
the partnership is cooperating fully with sec staff 
based on a recently completed internal review of the forecast and terms of the acquisition  the enbridge group continues to believe that the financial forecast had a reasonable basis and the price paid for the assets was fair to the partnership 
the partnership believes that the informal investigation will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the partnership 
item legal proceedings the partnership is a party in a limited number of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
the partnership believes that the outcome of these matters will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the partnership

highlights the partnership had a pivotal year in the growth strategy that was initiated in  with the acquisitions of the north dakota and east texas systems  was further enhanced by the acquisition of the midcoast system in the fourth quarter of in addition  a new source of capital was made available to the partnership with the issuance of a new class of limited partner units called i units  concurrent with the acquisition of the midcoast system 
on the lakehead system  expansion work continued on the terrace phase iii project  along with construction of additional pipeline facilities in the chicago area to improve delivery flexibility  in anticipation of future increased volumes from the alberta oil sands projects in western canada 
deliveries on the lakehead system were impacted by pressure restrictions on one of the lines following a leak in minnesota in july however  the effect on its customers was minimized due to efforts taken to advance the in service date on a portion of the terrace phase iii project in the affected area 
active clean up measures at the leak site were completed prior to winter  and it is expected that final remediation efforts will take place in the spring of businesses as a result of the midcoast system acquisition in october  the partnership changed its internal management organization effective in the fourth quarter of the partnership now conducts its business through five business segments liquids transportation  natural gas transportation  gathering and processing  marketing and corporate 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of the partnership s long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
liquids transportation liquids transportation includes the operations of the lakehead system  which consists of crude oil and liquid petroleum transportation and storage assets in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states 
the lakehead system serves all the major refining centers in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the province of ontario  canada 
liquids transportation also includes the operations of the north dakota system  which includes crude oil gathering lines connected to a transportation line that interconnects directly with the lakehead system in the state of minnesota 
natural gas transportation natural gas transportation consists of four ferc regulated natural gas transmission pipeline systems and intrastate natural gas transmission and wholesale customer pipeline systems located in the mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
these pipeline systems form part of the midcoast system assets that were acquired from the general partner in october gathering and processing gathering and processing includes the east texas system  acquired on november   and  the northeast texas system  the south texas system and certain other assets of the midcoast system  all of which were acquired from the general partner in october collectively  these systems include natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  twelve natural gas treating plants and eleven natural gas processing plants 
the midcoast system assets also include trucks  trailers and rail cars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
these assets are largely located in the mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
marketing marketing primarily provides natural gas supply  transmission and sales services for producers and wholesale customers using the partnership s pipelines as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
natural gas marketing activities are primarily undertaken to increase pipeline utilization  realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  and provide value added services to customers 
corporate corporate consists of costs of financing  interest income  minority interest and certain other costs such as franchise taxes  that are not allocated to the other business segments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the partnership s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for these estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any effects on the partnership s business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the partnership believes the critical accounting policies discussed in the following paragraphs affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues of the liquids transportation segment are derived from interstate transportation of crude oil and liquid petroleum under tariffs regulated by the ferc 
the tariffs specify the amounts to be paid by shippers for service between receipt and delivery locations and the general terms and conditions of transportation service on the respective pipeline systems 
revenues are recorded upon delivery 
the partnership does not own the crude oil and liquid petroleum that it transports  and therefore does not assume the related commodity risk 
revenues of the natural gas transportation segment are generally derived from reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on the ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems  while revenues from intrastate pipelines are generally derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
customers of the ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
revenues are recognized as natural gas is delivered to customers 
revenues of the gathering and processing segment are derived from gathering and processing services under the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  the partnership receives a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transmission of raw natural gas and providing other gathering services 
these revenues correlate with volumes and types of service  and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
other arrangements the partnership also utilizes other types of arrangements in its natural gas gathering and processing business percentage of index contracts under these contracts  the partnership purchases raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index 
the partnership then resells the natural gas  generally for the index prices  keeping the difference as its fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a negotiated percentage of the natural gas it processes in the form of residue natural gas  ngls condensate and sulfur  which it then sells at market prices 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  the partnership gathers or purchases raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased gas is consumed during processing 
the partnership extracts and retains the ngls produced during processing for its own account  which it sells at market prices 
in instances where the partnership purchases raw gas at the wellhead  it also sells for its own account the residue gas resulting from processing at market prices 
in those instances when the partnership gathers and processes raw natural gas for the account of the producer  it must return to the producer residue gas with a british thermal unit btu content equivalent to the original raw gas it received 
some of these arrangements expose the partnership to commodity price risk  which is substantially mitigated by offsetting physical purchases and sales and financial derivative instruments 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of natural gas to customers or upon services rendered 
revenues of the marketing segment are derived from providing supply  transmission and sales service for producers and wholesale customers on the partnership s natural gas gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
natural gas marketing activities are primarily undertaken to increase pipeline utilization  realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  and provide value added services to customers 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by the marketing business is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at the request of some customers  the partnership will enter into long term fixed price purchase or sale contracts with its customers and usually will enter into offsetting positions under the same or similar terms 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of natural gas to customers or upon services rendered 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated based on the estimated useful lives of the assets  which requires various assumptions to be made  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
changes in any of these assumptions may impact the rate at which depreciation is recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  if it is determined that an asset s undepreciated cost may not be recoverable due to economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors  the asset would be reviewed for impairment and any necessary reduction in its value would be recorded as a charge against earnings 
if there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
goodwill and other intangible assets the partnership s goodwill and intangible assets include values assigned to goodwill associated with the acquisitions of the east texas and midcoast systems  as well as values assigned to contract based assets that have a fixed or determinate term 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets upon the acquisition of a business 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and written down if the recorded value exceeds fair value 
fair value is assessed based on an estimate of future cash flows from the related assets 
these cash flow estimates require the partnership to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating costs  legal and regulatory issues and other factors 
actual results can  and often do  differ from the projections and assumptions 
these changes can have a negative impact on the estimates of impairment which would result in charges to income 
in addition  further changes in the economic and business environment can impact the partnership s original and ongoing assessments of potential impairment 
other intangible assets  primarily consisting of customer contracts  are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the underlying assets 
the partnership tests other intangible assets periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred related to the underlying assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the recognized intangible asset 
if there are changes to any of the estimates and assumptions relating to goodwill and other intangible assets  actual results may differ 
accounting for derivative financial instruments the partnership recognizes all derivative financial instruments as assets and liabilities and measures them at fair value 
hedges of cash flow exposures are entered into to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
on the date that the partnership enters into the derivative  it is designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred to the extent that the hedges are deemed highly effective and are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in value is recognized immediately in earnings 
the partnership formally documents all derivative relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and its methods for assessing and testing correlation and hedge effectiveness 
the partnership also assesses  both at the inception of the hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in its hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item 
if the partnership determines that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge  it discontinues hedge accounting prospectively by including changes in the fair value of the derivative in current earnings 
all financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or anticipated transaction and are not used for speculative purposes 
the fair value of all derivative financial instruments reflects the partnership s best estimate and is based upon exchange traded prices  published market prices or over the counter market price quotations  whenever they are available 
quoted valuations may not be available due to location differences or terms that extend beyond the period for which quotations are available 
where quotes are not available  the partnership utilizes other valuation techniques or models to estimate market values 
these modeling techniques require the partnership to make estimations of future prices  price correlation and market volatility and liquidity 
the estimates also reflect factors for time value and volatility underlying the contracts  the potential impact of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  modeling risk  credit risk of counterparties and operational risk 
if there are changes to these estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ and these differences may be positive or negative 
oil shortage balance and oil measurement losses the oil shortage balance is recorded by the partnership based on measurement estimates 
these estimates are based on mathematical calculations and physical measurement and include assumptions related to the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
if there is a material change in these assumptions  it may result in a change to the carrying value of the oil overage balance or revision of oil measurement loss estimates 
operational balancing agreements payables and receivables associated with the activity on natural gas pipeline operational balancing agreements and imbalances are booked monthly 
these balances are either settled on a cash basis or are carried by the pipelines and shippers on an in kind basis

the following table reflects operating income by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years ended december   and dollars in millions operating income liquids transportation natural gas transportation gathering and processing marketing total operating income corporate net income liquids transportation description the lakehead and north dakota systems largely consist of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
these systems generate most of their revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum 
the lakehead system links crude oil production from western canada to markets in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the province of ontario  canada 
western canadian crude oil production comes from two sources  conventional drilling and oil sands extraction projects 
currently  conventional drilling produces the majority of the supply  however  with the number of new oil sands construction projects in progress  this stable source of supply is expected to increase significantly over the next ten years 
deliveries on the north dakota system are impacted by the willingness of crude oil producers to maintain their crude oil production and exploration activities in north dakota  montana and the province of saskatchewan  canada 
similar to the lakehead system  the north dakota system depends upon demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states 
results of operations operating income 
operating income for was million compared with million for and million for operating income was higher in compared with primarily due to higher revenues  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income for includes the full year results of the north dakota acquisition  whereas includes the results from the date of acquisition of may  operating income for was lower than due to higher operating expenses  partially offset by higher revenue 
operating revenue 
operating revenue for was million compared with million in and million in operating revenue was higher in compared to due to increased average tariffs  partially offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system  and a full year contribution from the north dakota system 
average tariffs were higher due to positive adjustments calculated under ferc regulations and agreements with customers 
as well  the amount of heavy oil transported on the lakehead system  which attracts a higher tariff  was higher in compared to operating revenue for was higher than due to increased average tariffs  partially offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system 
average tariffs were higher in primarily due to the tariff associated with the terrace expansion that increased effective april  deliveries 
deliveries averaged million bpd on the lakehead system in  compared to million bpd in and million bpd in western canadian crude oil production was comparable over the three years  however  volumes delivered on the lakehead system declined over the period as western canadian crude oil was delivered to other markets

natural gas transportation description the partnership s ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems generally derive their revenue from capacity reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas  while its intrastate pipelines generally derive their revenue from the bundled sales of natural gas and from transmission services 
customers of the partnership s ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
in some cases  the partnership s marketing operation uses the capacity on these pipeline systems to sell natural gas it owns to its customers  such as local distribution companies or industrial facilities 
the table below indicates the fourth quarter average daily volume  as well as total capacity reserved at december   for the major assets in the partnership s natural gas transportation segment in million british thermal units per day 
average mmbtu d capacity reserved major natural gas transportation systems midla pipeline alatenn pipeline a utos pipeline  kansas pipeline bamagas pipeline other major intrastates up to total  a certain firm contracts are expected to expire in on the alatenn system 
if these contracts are not renewed  capacity reserved could decrease to approximately by december  results of operations the natural gas transportation segment was established upon the acquisition of the midcoast system on october  its results of operations are included in the partnership s results since that date and therefore  there is no comparative data for prior periods 
gathering and processing description the partnership receives revenues for its gathering and processing services under the following types of arrangements fee based arrangements under a fee based contract  the partnership receives a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transmission of raw natural gas and providing other gathering services 
these revenues correlate with volumes and types of service  and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
the partnership prefers fee based contracts because they produce relatively stable cash flows 
other arrangements while the partnership prefers fee based contracts  it also utilizes other types of arrangements in its natural gas gathering and processing business  including percentage of index contracts under these contracts  the partnership purchases raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index 
the partnership then resells the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as its fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under these contracts  the partnership receives a negotiated percentage of the natural gas it processes in the form of residue natural gas  ngls and sulfur  which it then sells at market prices 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  the partnership gathers or purchases raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased gas is consumed during processing 
the partnership extracts and retains the ngls produced during processing  which it sells at market prices 
in instances when the partnership purchases raw gas at the wellhead  it also sells for its own account at market prices the residue gas resulting from processing 
in those instances where the partnership gathers and processes raw natural gas for the account of the producer  it must return to the producer residue gas with a btu content equivalent to the original raw gas it received 
some of these other arrangements expose the partnership to commodity price risk  which is mitigated by offsetting physical purchases and sales and the use of financial derivative instruments 
in addition  the partnership occasionally takes title to natural gas and ngls for other reasons  such as to sell these products to customers 
the partnership will continue to hedge a significant amount of this commodity price risk to support the stability of cash flows 

please read item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk for more information

gathering systems mmbtu d east texas system anadarko northeast texas system tilden total results of operations the east texas system was acquired on november   and the remaining systems were purchased as part of the midcoast system on october  therefore  comparative results for include only one month of operations from the east texas system and includes less than months of operation of the midcoast system 
marketing description the partnership s marketing operation provides supply  transmission and sales service for producers and wholesale customers on its gathering  transmission and customer pipelines as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide value added services to customers 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by marketing is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at the request of the customer  the partnership will enter into long term fixed price purchase or sales contracts with its customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
result of operations the marketing segment was established upon the acquisition of the midcoast system on october  its results of operation are included in the partnership s results since that date  and therefore  there is no comparative data for prior periods 
corporate description corporate consists of costs of financing  interest and other income  minority interest and certain other costs such as franchise taxes  which are not allocated to the other business segments 
results of operations interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in increased interest expense from higher average debt balances was more than offset by lower interest rates and higher interest capitalized on construction projects due to the terrace expansion in liquidity and capital resources the partnership believes that it will continue to have adequate liquidity to fund future recurring operating and investing activities 
the primary cash requirements for the partnership consist of normal operating expenses  maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to partners and acquisitions of new businesses 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions are expected to be funded through several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities  i unit payment in kind distributions in lieu of cash and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities  including common units and i units 
the partnership s ability to complete future debt and equity offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates and its financial condition and credit rating at the time 
during  working capital increased by million to million  primarily due to the decrease in the short term loans from the general partner 
these loans were partially repaid with the net proceeds of the march  class a common unit issuance and the balance was refinanced as part of the october  midcoast acquisition from the general partner 
the remaining working capital deficit at december  of million is expected to be funded from operating cash flow 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up million from december  of this amount  million was used for the cash distribution paid to unitholders on february  per unit  including million of cash in respect of the i units that was retained by the partnership for use in its business 
the net cash payment to class a and class b unitholders and the general partner is million 
the remaining million is available for future cash distributions  capital expenditures and other business needs 
cash flows from operating activities for were million  compared to million for cash flows from operating activities primarily reflect the effects of increased net income due to increased revenue on the lakehead system  the incorporation of a full year of operating results from the north dakota and east texas systems  which were acquired in  and the impact of the acquisition of the midcoast system in october cash outflows used in investing activities were million  compared with million in in october  the partnership acquired the midcoast system for a total purchase price of approximately million after working capital and other adjustments 
as of december   approximately million in cash consideration had been paid for the assets with the remaining purchase price being comprised of assumed debt  a working capital amount payable and equity issued to the general partner 
for additional information regarding the midcoast system acquisition  see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
in  the partnership anticipates spending approximately million for system enhancements  million for core maintenance activities  million for lakehead system expansion projects and million related to the acquisition of a natural gas transmission system connected to the south texas system 
excluding major expansion projects and acquisitions  ongoing capital expenditures are expected to average approximately million annually approximately for core maintenance and for system enhancements 
core maintenance activities  such as the replacement of equipment and planned major maintenance activities  are undertaken to enable the partnership s systems to operate at their maximum operating capacity 
enhancements to the systems are expected to extend the life of the systems  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and permit the partnership to respond to developing industry and government standards and the changing service expectations of its customers 
cash flows from financing activities were million in compared to million in these cash flows are affected primarily by proceeds of unit issuances  fixed rate and variable rate financing  distributions to partners  and borrowings from affiliates 
during  the acquisition of the midcoast system was financed primarily with net proceeds of million from an issuance of i units and the assumption of debt from affiliates of enbridge 
at december   the partnership had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage notes bearing interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually 
the notes are due and payable in ten equal annual installments of million  the first of which was made in december  through the use of operating cash flow and variable rate financing 
the remaining payments are expected to be funded by operating cash flows and refinancing arrangements 
at december   the partnership had two unsecured revolving credit facilities  a million three year term facility and a million day facility 
the partnership and the lakehead partnership had borrowed million and million  respectively  under the two facilities 
as of december   million was drawn on the day facility at a weighted average interest rate of and million was drawn on the three year term facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
on january   the partnership amended and restated the terms of its two unsecured revolving credit facilities 
the new facilities consist of the amended and restated million three year facility  which matures in  subject to extension as provided in the facility  and the amended and restated million day facility  which matures in  subject to a one year term out option and extension as provided in the facility 
the partnership is the sole borrower under the new facilities and there are no guarantees of the obligations under either facility 
the amended and restated terms of the facilities are substantially similar to the original facilities with the exception of certain amendments to the covenants 
among other changes  under the new facilities  the partnership must maintain a certain interest coverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter and is no longer required to maintain a particular credit rating 
although subsidiaries may incur debt with certain restrictions and limitations under the new facilities  the partnership expects to provide funding to its subsidiaries  including the lakehead partnership 
as at january   million related to the day facility and million related to the three year facility were transferred to the amended and restated facilities 
as of december   the partnership had million in debt outstanding under four notes to affiliates of the general partner 
these notes largely evidence debt assumed by the partnership in connection with the acquisition of the midcoast system in october the notes mature in and have cross default provisions that are triggered by events of default under the first mortgage notes issued by the lakehead partnership or defaults under the partnership s three year term facility and day facility 
the notes are subordinate to the partnership s credit facilities and other senior indebtedness 
the partnership anticipates refinancing these notes during for additional information regarding the amounts and interest rates associated with the affiliate notes see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the lakehead partnership s secured first mortgage notes are rated a by standard poors and a by moody s  and its senior unsecured notes are rated bbb by standard poors and a by moody s 
the ratings by moody s are currently under review and are likely to change 
on march   the partnership issued million class a common units at per unit 
the net proceeds from the offering were million and were used to repay indebtedness 
on april    class a common units were issued in connection with the underwriter s exercise of the over allotment option granted in connection with the issuance on march  net proceeds from the units issued from the over allotment totaled million 
on october   the partnership issued  i units to enbridge management for net proceeds of million 
the partnership used the net proceeds to repay debt owed to affiliates that was assumed in connection with the acquisition of the midcoast system 
the partnership has on file with the sec a million shelf registration statement for the issuance of class a common units 
the purpose of this registration statement is to give the partnership flexibility to respond quickly to attractive financing opportunities in the capital markets as it pursues its growth strategy and manages its debt obligations 
approximately million in class a common units are available for issuance under this registration statement 
the partnership distributes quarterly to the general partner and the holders of its common units an amount equal to its available cash  which generally is defined to mean for any calendar quarter the sum of all of the cash receipts of the partnership plus net reductions to reserves less all of its cash disbursements and net additions to reserves 
these reserves are retained to provide for the proper conduct of the partnership s business  to stabilize distributions of cash to unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the same terms of any agreement or obligation of the partnership 
enbridge management  as the delegate of the general partner under the delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of the partnership s available cash 
enbridge management  as owner of the i units  however  does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that the partnership makes a cash distribution to the general partner and the holders of its common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of total units in the partnership owned by enbridge management will increase automatically under the provisions of the partnership s partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the number of enbridge management s shares and voting shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase per i unit is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to the general partner and owners of common units are treated as distributions of available cash  even though the i unit holder will not receive cash 
the partnership will retain and use that cash in its business 
summary of obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the partnership s obligations and commitments at december  dollars in millions payment due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt  right of way operating leases purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations  right of way payments are estimated to be approximately million per year for the remaining life of the pipeline 
for purposes of this table  the partnership has estimated its remaining life to be years 
other matters future prospects the partnership believes that its financial performance will continue to improve in as a result of increased capacity utilization on the lakehead system  combined with full year contributions from the recently acquired midcoast system and related acquisition activity 
liquids transportation average daily crude oil deliveries on the lakehead system are expected to increase substantially during from approximately million barrels per day in to between and million bpd in a majority of the growth in deliveries is expected to come from three major oil sands projects being completed in alberta 
the largest  the aosp  is sponsored by two multinational integrated oil companies and an independent oil and gas company 
aosp and two smaller oil sands sagd extraction projects will add more than  bpd to the crude oil supply in western canada 
most of this new supply is expected to be routed via the lakehead system for delivery in the midwest us these new oil sands projects are expected to significantly increase crude oil production beyond that currently produced from the two major oil sands projects that have been in operation for over a decade 
future prospects for the lakehead system are dependent upon increased crude oil production from western canada 
while conventional oil supplies in this area are declining  canada s oil sands supply is largely untapped 
estimated recoverable crude oil reserves from the oil sands  using existing technology  represent only of the volume in place  of approximately trillion barrels 
to put this in perspective  this total volume in western canada exceeds the estimated reserves of saudi arabia 
therefore this resource is expected to be an important crude oil supply for north america in the coming decades 
recognizing this  a number of major oil companies have announced projects requiring investments of approximately billion over the next decade 
this level of investment is expected to drive increased production of crude oil and enhanced utilization of the capacity available on the lakehead system 
as oil sands production increases  additional capacity expansions of the lakehead system are anticipated later in the decade 
recognizing the need to expand beyond the lakehead system s traditional markets  enbridge and the partnership are exploring alternative markets for canadian oil sands production in southern padd ii  and potentially  in other market areas 
other major oil sands projects are scheduled for completion during through including expansions of existing oil sands projects as well as new developments 
in addition to the oil sands  canada has substantial conventional crude oil resources 
conventional crude production will remain sensitive to the price of crude oil and the level of crude oil drilling activity

natural gas gathering and processing  transportation and marketing the partnership expects to significantly benefit from a full year s contribution from the recently acquired midcoast system  supplemented by improved asset performance and minor acquisitions in the area of the partnership s existing assets 
the partnership s natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas of the united states 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
during  new and expanded wholesale customer connections are expected to improve financial performance together with capital expenditures targeted to increase the processing and treating capability of our natural gas gathering assets 
results of the partnership s natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas served by the partnership 
during  drilling activity resulted in increased volumes on certain systems relative to the prior year 
however  in some instances  volume on certain of the partnership s gathering systems decreased 
based on discussions with producers  access to capital and certainty of commodity prices are causing a number of the independent natural gas producers to scale back their development activity 
growth by acquisitions small acquisitions are expected to play a role in the achievement of financial targets of the partnership for in general  these acquisitions are in or near areas where the partnership already operates 
these acquisitions present the best opportunities for consolidation savings and enhancing the partnership s market position 
approximately million of capital has been targeted for this type of activity in the amount includes approximately million that has been earmarked for a previously announced acquisition in south texas that remains subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions 
the partnership is not certain when  or if  the south texas acquisition will be closed 
the partnership also will evaluate more significant acquisitions 
enbridge has a history of pursuing and consummating acquisitions and  subject to financing capability  plans to use the partnership as its primary vehicle for acquiring mature energy delivery assets  particularly in the gulf coast region of the united states 
the partnership will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions from unaffiliated parties 
the partnership could also make additional acquisitions directly from enbridge or its subsidiaries in the future 
the partnership anticipates an increased availability of attractive acquisition targets and believes that it is well positioned to acquire additional assets 
while there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements or ongoing negotiations for the acquisition of any material business or assets  such transactions can be effected relatively quickly and may occur at any time 
regulatory matters kansas pipeline a settlement has been reached with kansas gas services kgs  kansas corporation commission kcc and the partnership to resolve all disputes between the parties relating to the rates kgs is paying the partnership 
under the settlement on november   kgs began paying negotiated rates based on a cost of service of million 
this represents a reduction from the annual rates approved by the ferc in the settlement was filed for approval at ferc and the kcc on february  upon approval of the settlement  kgs and kcc will dismiss appeals relating to these disputes pending in the kansas court of appeals  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia and the united states court of appeals for the th circuit 
utos pipeline the partnership s utos pipeline system is required to periodically file new rates with the ferc 
the partnership has initiated a proceeding at the ferc regarding transportation rates that will be effective in the partnership does not expect a rate case on the utos pipeline system to have a material effect on its results of operations on a consolidated basis 
liquids petroleum pipelines since  ferc regulated liquid petroleum pipelines have been generally subject to an indexed ceiling rate methodology under which the annual change in the ceiling rate is the annual change in the producers price index for finished goods minus ppi 
in december  ferc affirmed this methodology and the existing index 
the petroleum industry appealed this decision and on february  the ferc issued an order on remand  replacing the ppi index by removing the reduction 
as this order revisits the ferc s decision to continue with the ppi index in december  the ferc has agreed to the recalculation of current ceiling levels to reflect the revised ppi index as at july  and the partnership has filed for a change in its tariff rates for its lakehead and north dakota systems that reflect these higher ceilings 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which must be adopted in years beginning after june  this standard requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets to be recognized at fair value 
when the liability is initially recorded  the cost is capitalized by increasing the asset s carrying value  which is subsequently depreciated over its useful life 
the partnership adopted the new standard effective january  and it did not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
subsequent event on january   the partnership experienced a crude oil leak on the lakehead system from tank farm terminal piping at the superior  wisconsin terminal 
approximately  barrels of crude oil were released into the terminal ditch and containment system with approximately barrels of the released oil breaching the containment system and flowing onto the frozen nemadji river 
free oil was removed from the ice  and monitoring has confirmed no evidence of oil reaching the river s waters 
cleanup and remediation continues under the oversight of the state environmental agency 
no long term environmental damage is anticipated 
mainline service was only partially interrupted for hours 
the release was attributed to the failure of an end cap on a section of station piping and the partnership has submitted an assessment and prevention action plan to the federal office of pipeline safety ops 
total costs of cleanup  recovery and remediation is estimated at million to million 
the partnership does not expect environmental fines  however a fine of up to the newly raised maximum of  could be imposed by ops  although the partnership has not been made aware of ops s intent to propose fines or pursue further enforcement actions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign exchange risk to the extent the amounts drawn under its revolving credit facilities carry a floating rate of interest  the partnership s earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is managed through periodically refinancing floating rate bank debt with long term fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate risk management hedge contracts 
the partnership does not have any material exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates as virtually all of its revenue and expense is denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that a material foreign exchange exposure arises  the partnership intends to hedge such exposure using forward or other derivative contracts
