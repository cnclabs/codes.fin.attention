federal regulation sarbanes oxley act of on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
the act is a comprehensive piece of legislation that will increase the cost and complexity of doing business 
the act s principal reforms include the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  auditor independence provisions that restrict the non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  a range of corporate governance and responsibility measures  expanded disclosure requirements  including accelerated section a reporting by insiders  mandatory disclosure by analysts of potential conflicts of interest  and a range of new penalties for fraud and other violations other provisions in the act increase the securities and exchange commission s funding and enforcement powers  and require various studies and reports 
we intend to comply fully with the act 
health insurance portability and accountability act of the health insurance portability and accountability act of imposes new requirements relating to a variety of issues that affect the company s business  including the privacy and security of medical information  limits on exclusions based on preexisting conditions for certain plans  guaranteed renewability of health care coverage for most employers and individuals and administrative simplification procedures involving the standardization of transactions and the establishment of uniform health care provider  payor and employer identifiers 
various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of this act 
this law is far reaching and complex  and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
because the rules implementing this law are still evolving  we can not assure you that the costs of compliance with this law will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to significantly change the way we operate our business 
on december   the department of health and human services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information and the department of health and human services published revisions to the final rule in august the primary purposes of the privacy rule are to protect and enhance the rights of consumers by providing them access to their health information and controlling the inappropriate use of that information  and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery by creating a national framework for health privacy protection that builds on efforts by states  health systems  individual organizations and individuals 
the final rule was effective april health plans  providers and health care clearinghouses have until april  to come into compliance with the final rule 
we have instituted a process to ensure our compliance with the final rule by that date 
the department of health and human services also released its final rule for electronic data standards under the health insurance portability and accountability act of on august   effective october  this rule establishes the standard data content and format for the electronic submission of claims and other administrative health transactions 
we filed for an extension  as permitted by the administrative simplification compliance act  and have instituted a process to ensure our compliance with the final electronic data standards rule by the october  compliance date 
on february   the department of health and human services issued its final rule for security standards under the health insurance portability and accountability act of this rule establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information while being held by an entity and while the information is in transit between entities 
the compliance date for the security standards rule is april  we have implemented a plan of action to achieve compliance with the final security standards rule by the compliance date 
on january   the us department of labor s pension and welfare benefits administration  the internal revenue service and the department of health and human services issued two regulations that provide guidance on the nondiscrimination provisions under the health insurance portability and accountability act of as they relate to health factors and wellness programs 
these nondiscrimination provisions prohibit a group health plan or group health insurance issuer from denying an individual eligibility for benefits or charging an individual a higher premium based on a health factor 
we currently do not believe that these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business 
employee retirement income security act of the provision of services to certain employee health benefit plans is subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
erisa regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us and employers who maintain employee benefit plans subject to erisa 
some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under erisa 
in addition  some states require licensure or registration of companies providing third party claims administration services for benefit plans 
we provide a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans that are covered by erisa 
the us department of labor adopted federal regulations that establish claims procedures for employee benefit plans under erisa insured and self insured 
the regulations shorten the time allowed for health and disability plans to respond to claims and appeals  establishes new requirements for plan responses to appeals and expands required disclosures to participants and beneficiaries 
the regulations apply to claims filed under a group health plan on or after the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after july  and not later than january  we do not believe that the rule will have a material adverse effect on our business 
medicare choice and medicaid some of our hmos contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services to provide services to medicare beneficiaries pursuant to the medicare choice program 
some of our hmos also contract with states to provide health benefits to medicaid recipients 
as a result  we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services may audit any health plan operating under a medicare choice contract to determine the plan s compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
in addition  we must file cost reimbursement reports for the medicare cost contracts  which are subject to audit and revision 
the united states congress enacted the benefit improvement and protection act of in december this law increases medicare and medicaid provider payments and enhances the benefit package for medicare beneficiaries 
the increased payment amounts were effective march  these amounts may only be used by medicare choice plans to increase funds to reduce beneficiary premiums or copayments  enhance benefits  stabilize or widen the network of health care providers available to beneficiaries or reserve funds to help offset premium increases or reduced benefits in the future 
at this time  management does not believe that the benefit improvement and protection act of will have a material effect on our operations 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services and the appropriate state regulatory agency have the right to audit any health plan operating under a medicaid managed care contract to determine the plan s compliance with state and federal law 
in some instances  states engage peer review organizations to perform quality assurance and utilization review oversight of medicaid managed care plans 
our hmos are required to abide by the peer review organizations standards 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a final medicaid managed care rule on january  the final rule includes strengthened beneficiary protections and new provisions designed to protect the rights of participants in the medicaid program 
specifically  the final rule requires states to assure continuous access to care for beneficiaries with ongoing health care needs who transfer from one health plan to another 
the new rule also requires states and plans to identify enrollees with special health care needs and to assess the quality and appropriateness of their care 
we currently do not believe that the rule will have a material adverse effect on our business 
the social security act imposes criminal and civil penalties for paying or receiving remuneration which is deemed to include a kickback  bribe or rebate in connection with any federal health care program  including the medicare  medicaid and federal employees health benefits programs 
the law and related regulations have been interpreted to prohibit the payment  solicitation  offering or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for the referral of federal health care program patients or any item or service that is reimbursed  in whole or part  by any federal health care program 
similar anti kickback provisions have been adopted by many states  which apply regardless of the source of reimbursement 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services have promulgated regulations that prohibit hmos with medicare contracts from including any direct or indirect payment to physicians or other providers as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services to a medicare beneficiary 
these regulations impose disclosure and other requirements relating to physician incentive plans such as bonuses or withholds that could result in a physician being at substantial financial risk as defined in medicare regulations 
our ability to maintain compliance with such regulations depends  in part  on our receipt of timely and accurate information from our providers 
while we believe we are in compliance with all such medicare regulations  we are subject to future audit and review 
in  as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  congress adopted a statutory exception for certain risk sharing arrangements 
the office of the inspector general has published two safe harbors addressing these risk sharing arrangements 
a safe harbor is a regulation that describes relationships and activities that are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  failure to satisfy each criterion of an applicable safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement constitutes a violation of the law  rather the arrangement must be analyzed on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances 
we believe that our risk agreements satisfy the requirements of these safe harbors 
in addition  the office of the inspector general has adopted other safe harbor regulations that relate to managed care arrangements 
we believe that the incentives offered by our hmos to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries and the discounts our plans receive from contracting health care providers satisfy the requirements of these safe harbor regulations 
we believe that our arrangements do not violate the federal or similar state anti kickback laws 
federal employees health benefits program we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
healthamerica pennsylvania  inc  our pennsylvania hmo subsidiary  has received draft audit reports from the opm that questioned approximately million of subscription charges for contract years that were paid to this subsidiary under the fehbp 
the reports recommend that if these amounts are deemed to be due  approximately million in lost investment income charges should also be recovered with respect to such overcharges  with additional interest continuing to accrue until repayment of the overcharged amounts 
this matter has also been referred to the office of the us attorney for consideration of a possible civil action 
we have responded to the opm and the us attorney with respect to the amounts questioned during these audits and have provided additional information to support our positions 
although we can not predict the outcome of this matter  management believes  after consultation with legal counsel  that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the accompanying financial statements 
recent federal managed care legislative proposals while both houses of congress passed some form of patients bill of rights legislation in  no such federal legislation currently exists 
despite congress failure to reconcile and pass a final patients bill of rights  the current administration has indicated a willingness to pass some form of patient protection legislation 
such patient protection legislation could adversely affect the managed care industry 
in february  rep 
charlie norwood re introduced patients bill of rights legislation that closely tracks the house version that died in the th congress 
the house bill permitted the filing of a claim for a wrongful coverage denial that was the proximate cause of personal injury to  or the death of  a patient 
under the bill  medically reviewable claims against health insurers would have been tried in state court but under federal law 
patients would also have been required to exhaust external review before filing suit 
patients who lost an external review decision would have had to overcome a rebuttable presumption that the insurer made the correct decision 
the bill capped non economic damages at million  and punitive damages would have been available only if insurers did not follow an external review decision and would have been capped at an additional million 
further  the bill limited class action lawsuits both future suits and pending suits where a class had not yet been certified against health insurers under both erisa and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico to group health plans established by a single plan sponsor 
the senate version of the patients bill of rights legislation that had passed in contained broader liability provisions 
the senate bill would have permitted patients to sue health plans in state court over medical judgments or in federal court over contractual issues  and it would not have capped damages in state courts 
in federal court  punitive damages would have been allowed  up to million  and there would have been no limit on economic and non economic damages 
president bush has stated that he would veto any patients bill of rights legislation that contained liability provisions similar to the senate bill 
we can not predict whether the provisions of the patients bill of rights legislation introduced by rep 
norwood will ultimately be enacted into law 
the house may pass a different version or no version at all  and any passed legislation must be passed by the senate and signed by the president 
we also can not predict what impact any patients bill of rights or other federal legislation would have on our business and operations 
numerous other proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to managed health care reform 
the provisions of legislation that may be adopted at the state level can not be accurately and completely predicted at this time  and we therefore can not predict the effect of proposed legislation on our operations 
on the federal level  it is possible that some form of managed health care reform may be enacted 
at this time  it is unclear as to when any legislation might be enacted or the content of any new legislation  and we can not predict the effect on our operations of the proposed legislation or any other legislation that may be adopted 
bush administration s proposed framework to overhaul medicare on march   the bush administration sent its framework to overhaul medicare to congress 
the bush administration s framework  which has not yet been introduced as a formal legislative proposal  envisions revamping medicare into a three part program that would partially privatize medicare 
if the framework is converted into a legislative proposal and ultimately enacted  the bush administration s proposed overhaul of medicare would give medicare beneficiaries very strong incentives to leave medicare s traditional fee for service plan and to join private managed care plans in order to obtain comprehensive prescription drug coverage 
we can not predict the impact such legislation would have on our business and operations if enacted 
risk management we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are appropriate 
as a result of significant premium increases required by insurers to renew our professional malpractice coverage  we formed a captive subsidiary to provide coverage for these events 
our captive subsidiary provides up to million in coverage for each event and up to million in coverage for each event that is a class action 
the captive has an aggregate policy limit of million 
on top of the captive s per event limit of million  we are co insured with our commercial carrier for an additional million 
each year we will re evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these types of claims 
employees at march   we employed  persons  none of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us  medical malpractice actions  and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry general liability insurance for each of our operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
as a result of significant premium increases required by insurers to renew our professional malpractice coverage  we formed a captive subsidiary to provide coverage for these events 
our captive subsidiary provides up to million in coverage for each event and up to million in coverage for each event that is a class action 
the captive has an aggregate policy limit of million 
on top of the captive s per event limit of million  we are co insured with our commercial carrier for an additional million

 styled in re humana  inc  charles b 
shane  md  et al 
vs 
humana  inc  et al 
this action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against us and twelve other companies in the managed care field 
in its fourth amended complaint  the plaintiffs have alleged violations of rico  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate rico 
in addition to these rico claims  the complaint includes counts for breach of contract  violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit 
we have filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or  in the alternative  to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in our physician contracts 
the trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians  however  we were not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant 
the plaintiffs are currently pursuing class discovery against us and will then file their motion for class certification as to us 
the defendants who were subject to the certification order have filed an appeal with the th circuit court of appeals which has been granted 
although we can not predict the outcome  we believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to defend our position 
we may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving rico and the erisa  generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits  we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general overview we are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately million members  excluding our network rental members discussed below  as of december  we operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans serving states  primarily in the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast regions 
we offer employers a broad range of commercial managed care products that vary with respect to the level of benefits provided  the costs paid by employers and members and the extent to which members access to providers is subject to referral or preauthorization requirements 
we offer underwritten or risk products  including health maintenance organizations hmo s  preferred provider organizations ppo s and point of service pos plans 
in addition  we offer defined contribution health plans 
our risk products also include medicare choice programs and state sponsored managed medicaid programs in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels  provider costs and regulatory climates 
for our risk products  we receive premiums in exchange for assuming underwriting risks and performing sales  marketing and administrative functions 
we also offer non risk products  including access to our provider networks and management services  to employers that self insure employee health benefits 
the management services we provide typically include network management  claims processing  utilization review and quality assurance 
for our non risk products  we receive fees for the access to our provider networks and the management services we provide  but we do not have underwriting risk 
in addition  we offer a product where we rent our network of providers network rental members to other managed care plans or non risk employers and assume no underwriting risk and provide no management services 
revenues we generate operating revenues from managed care premiums and management services 
our managed care premiums are derived from our commercial risk products and our government programs 
our commercial managed care premium revenues are comprised of premiums from our commercial hmo products and flexible provider products  including ppo and pos products for which we assume full underwriting risk 
premiums for such commercial ppo and pos products are typically lower than hmo premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are required of the ppo and pos members 
premium rates for commercial hmo  pos and ppo products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings 
in response to this regulatory review  we may have to modify or revise our rate filings in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
while these modifications have not been material in the past  no assurance can be given that future rate filings will be approved in the same fashion 
we provide comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receive premium payments from federal and state governments 
premium rates for the medicaid and medicare choice products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action 
during the three years ended december   we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues in part due to membership increases from acquisitions 
additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts  geographic expansion and increased product offerings 
one such product offering was the expansion of our ppo risk product to all of our health plans in another new product offering was the introduction of our healthassurance flex product in our pennsylvania market in  which was expanded to our georgia and iowa markets under the name coventry health care flex 
we believe that our products can be adapted in order to meet customer s cost reduction needs by offering a low benefit plan while still having a higher benefit plan as an option 
we will offer a broad choice of products as market conditions require and to meet the needs of customers and brokers 
our management services revenues result from operations in which our health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected hmo coverage 
we receive an administrative fee for these services  but do not assume underwriting risk 
certain of our management services contracts include performance and utilization management standards that if not met may cause us to incur penalties 
in addition  we offer a ppo product to other third party payors  under which we provide rental of and access to our ppo network  claims repricing and utilization review  and do not assume underwriting risk 
expenses our primary operating expenses consist of medical costs  selling  general and administrative expense  and depreciation and amortization expense 
our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation payments 
medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
in determining our ibnr liabilities  we employ standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each market s membership  product characteristics  geographic territories and provider network 
we also consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient  outpatient  pharmacy and other medical expenses  as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements 
estimates are reviewed by our underwriting  finance and accounting personnel and other appropriate health plan and corporate personnel 
judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience  changes in the delivery system  changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
we continually monitor and review our ibnr reserves  and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted  reflect these differences in current operations 
medical costs are affected by a variety of factors  including the severity and frequency of claims 
these factors are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within our control 
we continually refine our actuarial practices to incorporate new cost events and trends 
membership as of december   we had million risk members  million non risk members and million network rental members

critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates if different assumptions or information were used 
revenue recognition managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service 
premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in our records at the time of billing 
premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage 
premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations  additions  or other changes 
due to early timing of the premium billing  we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent month s billings 
current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments 
we also receive premium payments from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a monthly basis for our medicare choice membership 
membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with cms and could result in adjustments to revenue 
premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
employer contracts typically have a one year term  subject to cancellation by the employer group or by us upon days notice 
based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent  historical trends  bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts  we estimate  on a monthly basis  the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjust our revenue and reserves accordingly 
as of december   we maintained reserves for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately million compared with approximately million at december  we also maintained reserves for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the calculation for these reserves is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the reserve percentage increasing for the older receivables 
we contract with the office of personnel management opm to provide managed health care services under the federal employee health benefits program fehbp 
these contracts with the opm and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program 
the opm conducts periodic audits of its contractors to  among other things  verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under fehbp 
the opm may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program 
premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the office of personnel management on a periodic basis 
such audits are usually a number of years in arrears 
we record reserves  on an estimated basis annually  based on appropriate guidelines 
any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized 
we currently enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards 
these standards vary widely and could involve customer service  member satisfaction  claims processing  claims accuracy  telephone on hold time  etc 
under these performance guarantees  we could be at risk for not maintaining the standards held in the contracts 
the risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month  percentage of premium  or percentage of administration fees 
risk levels are evaluated quarterly and when these performance standards are not met a liability is established 
medical claims expense and liabilities medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported 
the estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics and other related information as described earlier in the section entitled expenses 
we also establish reserves  if required  for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts 
these accruals are continually monitored and reviewed  and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
we employ a team of actuaries that have developed  refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past six years 
for inpatient reserves  our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates traditional triangle based completion factors and incurred claims estimates calculated as authorized days multiplied by per diem forecasts 
for non inpatient reserves  our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates and trended per member per month estimates 
for both the inpatient and non inpatient reserves  lag based estimates receive little or no credibility weighting in the more current incurral months 
credibility factors are increased for older months within the lag models since those older months have a higher completion factor and are the best indicator of our ultimate cost 
within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services  there are certain assumptions that are used 
for inpatient services  authorized days are used for utilization factors  while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts 
the per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix 
for non inpatient services  a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service  provider contracts  utilization  and other factors 
medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriately conservative 
in of the most recent quarters  the reserve models have developed favorably 
this suggests that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims 
we believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization  provider contract changes and other components of medical cost trend 
additionally  in  an independent actuarial consulting firm began reviewing our reserve models and underlying assumptions 
the independent actuaries report their conclusions to the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
investments we account for investments in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we invest primarily in debt securities and classify all our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security 
this evidence includes  but is not limited to  the following adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer  segment  industry  region  or other variable 
the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
elimination or reduction in dividend payments  or scheduled interest and principal 
rating agency downgrade of a debt security 
decrease in expected cash flows of a debt security 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short term investments and generally consist of time deposits  us treasury notes and obligations of various states and municipalities 
long term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of debt securities 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria 
such intangible assets include  but are not limited to  trade and service marks  non compete agreements  customer lists and licenses 
sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets the market approach  the market capitalization approach and the income approach 
the market approach estimates a business s fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies 
the market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding 
the income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
all three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality 
any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place 
since the adoption of sfas no 
on january   and through december   we have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill

new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure as an amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in our footnotes to the financial statements of our interim and annual reports 
we currently do not expect to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  and  accordingly  this statement did not affect our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and nullifies eitf issue no 
 cost associated with lease modification or termination 
sfas no 
requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued two standards related to business combinations 
the first statement  sfas no 
business combinations  requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting 
sfas no 
also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria 
such intangible assets include  but are not limited to  trade and service marks  non compete agreements  customer lists and licenses 
we were not significantly affected by the implementation of this statement 
the second statement  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
impairment charges may result in future write downs in the period in which the impairment took place 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
for the fiscal year beginning january   and  accordingly  goodwill was not amortized during nor did we incur an impairment charge related to goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 

accordingly  a transition gain of million  net of tax  was recorded in the first quarter of related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature 
the adjustment was shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
acquisitions and dispositions during the three years ended december   we completed several business combinations and membership purchases 
our business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and  accordingly  the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition 
the purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets  including the identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
prior to december   goodwill was amortized over a useful life of years 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
the purchase price of our membership purchases was allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of five to fifteen years

commercial premium rates increased by an average of over on a per member per month pmpm basis  to pmpm 
management services revenue increased in from as a result of the previously discussed acquisitions 
in particular  the health partners  blue ridge  newalliance and mid america acquisitions accounted for approximately  new non risk members 
medical costs increased in compared to due to membership growth  as discussed above  and medical trend 
our commercial medical trend for the year ended was and the average trend for the three year period ended december  was 
our medical loss ratio improved in in our commercial and medicare product lines as a result of rate increases outpacing medical trends 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased in primarily due to acquisitions  an increase in fees paid to brokers and incremental salary expense related to the expansion of our customer service organization 
during  we opened a new regional service center in bismarck  north dakota to perform customer service functions related to the mid america acquisition and to create additional capacity for future acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased slightly by to for depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
in january in accordance with sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill but rather test for impairment at least once a year 
in  we amortized million in goodwill 
we did not incur any impairment charges during senior notes interest and amortization expense was incurred in due to the issuance of our senior notes on february   as described below in liquidity and capital resources 
other income  net decreased in from due primarily to the change in valuation of a derivative instrument 
we recorded a gain in and a loss in related to this derivative 
the decrease is also related to a decrease in the amortization of discounts on investments  offset by an increase in interest income due to cash placed in long term investments to achieve higher yields 
our provision for income taxes increased in due to an increase in operating earnings  offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from in to in this decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning and due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in comparison of to managed care premium revenue increased in over primarily from rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from membership growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
premium rates increased by an average of over on a per member per month pmpm basis  to pmpm 
the acquisitions that contributed to the increase in premium revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of and in the first  second and third quarters of membership  and thus premium revenues  in the medicaid program continued to increase almost exclusively from growth in existing markets  including a new product offering in the fourth quarter of in our pennsylvania market 
during  we significantly increased medicare premiums in the st 
louis market  which was the primary reason for a membership loss in that market 
management services revenue increased in from as a result of three significant acquisitions wellpath in the fourth quarter of  health partners in the first quarter of and blue ridge in the third quarter of these three acquisitions accounted for  new non risk members 
medical costs increased in compared to due to business growth and medical trend 
business growth was primarily in the commercial and medicaid segments 
in the commercial segment  the increase in membership was mostly due to acquisitions throughout the year period 
medicaid growth was due to continuing underlying program growth 
a significant portion of the medicaid membership increase was related to a new lower cost mental health program that the commonwealth of pennsylvania implemented towards the end of selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased in primarily due to the additional expense associated with the acquired wellpath and blue ridge health plans 
sg a expense  as a percentage of revenue  decreased due to improved operational efficiencies  continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses  premium rate increases and acquisitions which required minimal incremental sg a 
depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
other income  net increased in from due to increased investment income as a result of an increase in our long term investments compared to the prior year 
we incurred no interest expense in our provision for income taxes increased in due to an increase in operating earnings and other income  net  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in to in this decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning 
liquidity and capital resources consolidated our total cash and investments  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  but excluding deposits of million restricted under state regulations  increased million to billion at december  from million at december net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
the latter was a result of increases in additional selling  general and administrative liabilities related to our acquisitions and business growth throughout and and an increase in our deferred tax liability as shown in 
note f to our consolidated financial statements 
these increases were offset by a decrease in total medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claims payments 
also  in we received months worth of medicare premium payments as a result of the timing of cms payments and only months of premium payments were received during which led to the decrease in our deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december  due to an increase in the amount of cash placed into short term and long term investments 
in addition  for the year ended december  we made payments related to acquisitions  net of transaction costs and cash acquired  of approximately million compared to cash acquired  net of transaction costs and cash payments  of approximately million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities during increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock  as discussed below in our share repurchase program section  compared to approximately million shares during on february   we completed the purchase of approximately million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable  at that time  for approximately million shares of our common stock  owned by principal health care  inc the aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was approximately million 
the purchase of the shares and warrant from principal ended their ownership of our common stock 
we financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of million of our senior notes due february  interest on the notes is payable on february and august each year 
the first interest payment of million was made on august  the senior notes contain certain covenants  including covenants regarding incurring additional debt  limiting dividends or other restricted payments  and restricting transactions with affiliates  sales of assets and consolidations or mergers 
we have complied with all covenants under the senior notes 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased over due to an increase in net earnings  an increase in deferred revenue related primarily to the timing of medicare premium payments and an increase in medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claim payments 
net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december  as a result of an increase in the amount of cash placed in short term and long term investments 
net cash used in financing activities during is primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock 
our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal 
the fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of aa and an average contractual maturity of years  as of december  we believe that since our long term investments are available for sale  the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing our working capital and liquidity 
on such basis  current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to million at december  from million at december  health plans our hmos  our insurance company subsidiary  coventry health and life insurance company ch l  and our captive subsidiary  chc risk retention group  inc crrg  are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances  thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its hmos  ch l and crrg 
during  the parent collected million in dividends from our subsidiaries subject to such regulatory restrictions 
risk based capital rbc is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile 
this calculation  approved by the national association of insurance commissioners naic  incorporates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk and business risk components 
our health plans are required to submit an rbc report to the naic and their domiciled state s department of insurance with their annual filing 
the rbc results are used to determine whether the health plan s net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile 
regulators use the rbc results to determine if any regulatory actions are required 
regulatory actions  if any  range from filing a financial corrective action plan to the health plan being placed under regulatory control 
the majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted an rbc policy that recommends that health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the company action level which is currently equal to of their rbc currently for ch l 
although not all states have adopted the rbc policy  we maintain all of our health plans at this standard 
the total surplus in excess of of rbc for all of our hmo subsidiaries was approximately million at december   up from million at december  these total statutory reserves for our hmo subsidiaries  as a percentage of rbc  was and as of december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to current year earnings from our hmo subsidiaries and the previously mentioned acquisitions  offset by dividends paid to the parent company 
ch l had surplus in excess of of rbc of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the total statutory reserve for ch l  as a percentage of rbc  was and as of december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to income 
crrg had surplus in excess of of rbc of approximately million at december  the total statutory reserve for crrg  as a percentage of rbc  was as of december  excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation  we had cash and investments of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in non regulated cash and investments is primarily a result of payments made to repurchase shares of our own common stock and payments for acquisitions offset by ordinary operating activities 
these funds are available to make interest or principal payments on the senior notes or any other debt that we may incur  to make loans to or investments in subsidiaries  to fund acquisitions  for stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes 
a significant portion of these funds is dependent upon operating profits generated by our regulated operating subsidiaries and the ability to receive dividends from those subsidiaries 
although there is no assurance  we expect to receive regulatory approval for future dividend payments 
we have entered into agreements with certain of our regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital  if necessary  to prevent the subsidiary s impairment of net worth requirements 
during  we made capital contributions of million to our hmo subsidiaries 
this includes a million contribution made to a subsidiary to increase statutory reserves above even though the subsidiary is operating in a state that has not adopted the rbc policy 
other as of december   we are contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years senior notes   operating leases      less sublease income    total contractual obligations     refer to 
note i to our consolidated financial statement for disclosure related to our operating leases 
projected capital investments in of approximately million consist primarily of computer hardware  software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems 
the united states department of health and human services has issued rules  as mandated by the health insurance portability and accountability act of  which  among other things  impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data  including a member s transactions with health care providers and payors  as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers 
the privacy standards were issued on december   and becomes mandatory on april  as of december   we had spent approximately million on compliance matters during and we anticipate spending approximately million in  approximately million of which we expect will be capitalized  related to our compliance with the electronic transaction code sets  provider identifier standards and security and patient information privacy standards 
the nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to three months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs 
the demand for our products and services are subject to many economical fluctuations  risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in this form k for more information 
management believes that our cash flows generated from operations  cash and investments and excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  capital expenditures and debt interest costs at least through december  risk sensitive financial instruments and position we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include an emphasis on credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments  should potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
the analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
while we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible  actual results may differ 
increase decrease in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate decrease increase of x basis points as of december  in thousands share repurchase program on december   we announced a program to purchase up to of our outstanding common stock 
in august  our board of directors approved the repurchase up to an additional of our outstanding common stock 
stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market  by block purchase or in private transactions 
as a part of this program  we purchased million shares of our common stock in at an aggregate cost of million 
the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under the program  including the new authorization  was approximately million as of december  legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us  medical malpractice actions and other various claims seeking monetary damages 
the claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial 
incidents occurring through december  may result in the assertion of additional claims 
we carry general liability insurance for each of our operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves 
as a result of significant premium increases required by insurers to renew our professional malpractice coverage  we formed a captive subsidiary to provide coverage for these events 
our captive subsidiary provides up to million in coverage for each event and up to million in coverage for each event that is a class action 
the captive has an aggregate policy limit of million 
on top of the captive s per event limit of million  we are co insured with our commercial carrier for an additional million 
each year we will re evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these types of claims 
in the opinion of management  the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we are a defendant in the provider track in the managed care litigation filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  miami division  mdl no 
 styled in re humana  inc  charles b 
shane  md  et al 
vs 
humana  inc  et al 
this action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against us and twelve other companies in the managed care field 
in its fourth amended complaint  the plaintiffs have alleged violations of rico  conspiracy to violate rico and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate rico 
in addition to these rico claims  the complaint includes counts for breach of contract  violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit 
we have filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or  in the alternative  to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in our physician contracts 
the trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians  however  we were not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant 
the plaintiffs are currently pursuing class discovery against us and will then file their motion for class certification as to us 
the defendants who were subject to the certification order have filed an appeal with the th circuit court of appeals which has been granted 
although we can not predict the outcome  we believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to defend our position 
we may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving rico and the erisa  generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care 
although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits  we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits 
our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations 
legislation and regulation numerous proposals have been introduced in the united states congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform 
some proposals  if enacted  could among other things  restrict our ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers 
certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care  while others would adversely affect managed care 
although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term 
pursuant to a health insurance portability and accountability act of mandate  the department of health and human services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information on december   effective april  we expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date 
the department of health and human services also released its final rule for electronic data standards on august   effective october  we expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the october  compliance date 
inflation in recent years  health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate 
to reduce the effect of health care cost inflation we have  where possible  increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting 
we can not assure you that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective 
outlook as a result of an improved sales force  a varied product offering  an improved underwriting process and superior customer service  we have increased our organic membership growth target to for the year we operate in highly competitive markets  but believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets  thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases 
we will continue to be diligent in attempting to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in  although at a slower pace than for  we will continue to pursue ways to improve our underwriting processes and oversight in both risk and management services products with the objective of increasing premium yields and profitable growth in all of our markets 
management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products 
we currently anticipate reducing selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to a rate not to exceed in  excluding the effect of any future acquisitions  through medical claims auto adjudication  improved customer service  e commerce initiatives and by slowing the increases in broker fees 
management believes that the foregoing should result in progressive earnings improvements in  although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors  some of which may be outside of our control 
risk factors the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
further  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services 
as a result  our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs 
we base the premiums we charge  at least in part  on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period 
factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  general inflation or economic downturns  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs  and other unforeseen occurrences 
in addition  medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims  which we call ibnr 
the estimates for submitted claims and ibnr are made on an accrual basis 
we believe that our reserves for ibnr are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities  but we can not assure you of this 
any adjustments to our ibnr reserves could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs 
although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs  we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition  government regulations and other factors 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
a reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage  reductions in work force by existing customers  increases in premiums or benefit changes  benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors  our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan  and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally 
our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations 
an important part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans 
during the last several years  we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions  including the acquisition of certain health plans from principal health care  inc in april we can not assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates  successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings 
the plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability 
our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions 
competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates 
we compete with other health plans for members 
we believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are price of benefits offered  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability of the plan  and diversity of product offerings 
we face competition from other managed care companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage  more established reputations in our markets  greater market share  lower costs and greater financial and other resources 
we depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers  and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future 
we depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services  particularly to small employer group members 
we do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers  and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products at reasonable costs 
our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership 
our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals  physicians and other health care providers 
the terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs 
in addition  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets 
in some of our markets  there are large provider systems that have a major presence 
some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future 
these provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us  place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us 
provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation 
we can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations 
over the last several years  the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services 
negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members 
a failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information 
failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences 
compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal  state and local level 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  for example  imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information 
the government published regulations to implement these provisions in december health plans must be in compliance by april the law is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing 
because these regulations and other similar federal  state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve  we can not guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly 
we conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is heavily regulated by federal  state and local authorities 
legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions  limit premium levels  increase minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly  prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks  prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits  limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider  limit contractual terms with providers  including audit  payment and termination provisions  and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials 
in addition  we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations 
federal  state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business 
we can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business 
we contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various federal programs  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or hmo or to otherwise provide a service 
we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories  that could significantly affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to our denial of health care benefits  vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims  disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to our non risk business  including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties  claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements  disputes over our copayment calculations  and customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies 
recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims 
in some cases  plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic  non economic or punitive damages 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award  could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event that a significant damage award does occur it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular 
we currently have  and expect to maintain  liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur 
potential liabilities that we incur may not  however  be covered by insurance  our insurers may dispute coverage  our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in the market s expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations 
the indenture for our senior notes  which were issued on february   imposes restrictions on our business and operations 
these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create or permit certain liens on our assets  sell assets  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future  which may impose further restrictions on us 
the restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit  among other things  our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs  make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities 
we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control 
in the event of a change of control of our company  we will be required  subject to certain conditions  to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase 
it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases 
our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes 
even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control  the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
warburg pincus has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with your interests as a stockholder 
warburg pincus  a private equity investment firm  currently beneficially owns  shares of our common stock  or approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as a result of its voting power  warburg pincus may be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to a vote of stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of a change in control or business combination of our company 
warburg pincus may purchase additional shares of our common stock  but has agreed  effective through may  not to own more than of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
when these limitations expire in may  warburg pincus could acquire additional shares of our common stock 
in addition to its ownership position  pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated securities purchase agreement between the company and warburg pincus  warburg pincus designated two directors to serve on our board of directors 
pursuant to the agreement and our certificate of incorporation  warburg pincus had the right to designate at least two directors until such time as warburg pincus converted its shares of our series a convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock  which occurred on december  the agreement provides that as long as warburg pincus retains ownership of at least of the shares of our common stock it beneficially owned at the time of its original investment in our predecessor in  it will continue to have the right to designate at least one member on our board of directors 
as of december   warburg pincus continued to beneficially own of the shares represented by its original investment and  therefore  currently has the right to designate one member of our board of directors 
warburg pincus also has certain rights under the agreement to require us to register all or part of the shares of our common stock owned by warburg pincus 
our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law could delay  discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable 
we have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
in addition  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may delay  discourage or prevent a merger  acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
among other things  these provisions authorize us to issue preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting  provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares  provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting 
these provisions of our stockholder rights plan  certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
effects of terrorism there can be no assurance that the war on terrorism  the threat of future acts of terrorism or the related concerns of members or providers will not adversely affect our health care costs and our ability to predict and control such costs 
future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect us through  among other things increased utilization of health care services including  without limitation  hospital and physician services  ancillary testing and procedures  vaccinations  prescriptions for drugs  mental health services and other services  loss of membership as the result of lay offs or other in force reductions of employment  adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees  disruption of our business or operations  and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general 
general economic conditions changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations 
the state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums 
the state of the economy has also affected the states budgets  which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to medicaid plans in those states in which we offer medicaid plans  and increase taxes and assessments on our activities 
although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through  among other things  increases in premiums  there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budgets cuts in states in which we operate 
although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership  there can be no assurance that the effects of the current downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant membership loss  lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk our only material risk of investments in financial instruments is in our debt securities portfolio 
we invest primarily in marketable state and municipal  us government and agencies  corporate and mortgage backed debt securities 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 

accordingly  a transition gain of million  net of tax  based on the valuation at december   was recorded in the first quarter of related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature 
we do not typically invest in derivative financial instruments 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include an emphasis on credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
investments are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine if declines in value are other than temporary 
in making that determination  all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security is considered 
debt securities with declines in value below cost due to market conditions or industry specific events where we intend and have the ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery  are not assumed to be other than temporary 
temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholder s equity 
a decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings 
realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis 
the fair value of our investments at december  was million 
our investments at december  mature according to their contractual terms  as follows  in thousands actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized fair as of december  cost value maturities within year   to years   to years   over years   total short term and long term securities   we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations  including government national mortgage administration and federal national mortgage administration 
our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments  should potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
the analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
while we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible  actual results may differ 
increase decrease in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate decrease increase of x basis points as of december  in thousands
