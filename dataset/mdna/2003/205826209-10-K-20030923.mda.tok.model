item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  produce and market innovative products  systems and services for advanced communications solutions 
we conduct our business through three complementary segments telecommunications transmission  mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers 
we offer niche product lines where we believe we have technological  engineering  systems design or other expertise that differentiate our product offerings 
we believe we are leaders in the market segments that we serve 
our telecommunications transmission segment  which is our largest business segment  provides sophisticated products and systems for satellite  over the horizon microwave and wireless line of sight telecommunication systems 
our mobile data communications segment provides satellite based mobile tracking and messaging services and mobile satellite transceivers primarily for defense applications  including logistics  support and battlefield command and control 
our rf microwave amplifier segment designs  manufactures and markets solid state high power  broadband rf microwave amplifier products 
all of our products and services are used in a variety of commercial and defense applications by domestic and international customers 
a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of revenues from which cannot be predicted 
quarterly sales and operating results may be significantly affected by one or more of such contracts 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
we generally recognize income on contracts only when the products are shipped 
however  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
profits expected to be realized on contracts are based on total estimated sales value as related to estimated costs at completion 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts in progress are recorded in the period in which such losses become known 
since our contract with the us army for the movement tracking system is for an eight year period  revenue recognition is based on the percentage of completion method 
the gross margin is based on the estimated sales and expenses for the entire eight year contract 
the amount of revenue recognized has been limited to the amount of funded orders received from the us army 
the portion of such orders representing prepaid service time revenue is being deferred until the service time is used by the customer 
significant changes in the estimates used to derive the gross profit margin can materially impact our operating results and financial condition in future periods see critical accounting policies below for more information 
our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiency  price competition and general economic conditions 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for marketing  sales and administrative employees  advertising and trade show costs  professional fees and amortization of deferred compensation 
our research and development expenses relate to both existing product enhancement and new product development 
a portion of our research and development efforts is related to specific contracts and is recoverable under those contracts because they are funded by the customers 
such customer funded expenditures are not included in research and development expenses for financial reporting purposes  but are reflected in cost of sales 
in july  we acquired the business of ef data  the satellite communications division of adaptive broadband corporation  for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
we combined this operation with our existing arizona based satellite earth station equipment operations  which resulted in enhanced product offerings  distribution reach and market presence 
the combined operations are part of our telecommunications transmission segment 
in april  we acquired certain assets and product lines of mpd technologies  inc for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million 
we combined this operation with our existing new york based operation  which resulted in expanded product offerings  customer base  and market presence 
the combined operations are part of our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
in july  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc aha for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we allocated the purchase price to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately million  of which million was allocated to in process research and development and expensed as of the acquisition date 
the results of operations in our telecommunications transmission segment include the aha related business commencing on august  critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
as discussed above  when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue and related costs are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become known 
some of our largest contracts  including our contract with the us army for the movement tracking system  are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years 
historically  we have demonstrated an ability to accurately estimate revenues and expenses relating to our long term contracts 
however  there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues and expenses  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
if we do not accurately estimate the total sales and related costs on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time 
such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
changes to these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have not experienced material terminations of our long term contracts 
we also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long term contracts 
our inability to perform on our long term contracts could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have been able to perform on our long term contracts 
impairment of intangible assets 
as of july   our company s intangible assets  including goodwill  aggregated million 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain international customers that we have determined could be a credit risk 
however  we are not able to obtain irrevocable letters of credit or credit insurance in all instances 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our net sales year ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense income  net income before income taxes net income comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million or 
the increase was driven by significant growth in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  as described below 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million in fiscal  as compared to sales of million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the sales growth in this segment resulted from i incremental sales of our over the horizon microwave systems in connection with two large contract awards in fiscal  ii sales relating to aha which we purchased in july and iii increased sales of our satellite earth station products 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal mobile data communications segment sales increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the sales growth in this segment was the result of higher sales of our movement tracking system to the us army  as well as sales to a major us prime contractor that is providing a battle command application to the us army 
our mobile data communications segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the increase was the result of strong defense related sales partially offset by weakness in our commercial product lines  such as our commercial aviation product line 
our rf microwave amplifier segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  one customer  a prime contractor  represented of total net sales 
in fiscal  no customer  other than the us government  represented more than of total net sales 
international sales represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including prime contractors to the us government represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the higher sales levels in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  was and in fiscal and  respectively 
although fiscal contained a significantly higher proportion of mobile data communications segment sales  which generally are at lower gross margins than our other businesses  the overall increase in sales resulted in greater operating efficiencies and overhead absorption 
included in cost of sales for fiscal and  respectively  are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million 
as discussed above under critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision  approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical usage and future usage assumptions 
the provision for fiscal also includes million relating to certain product line discontinuances in our telecommunications transmission segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million 
the increase was due to the addition of aha  as well as higher expenses relating to the higher sales and profit levels in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but are included in sales with the related estimated costs included in cost of sales 
in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of aha in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of the amortization related to intangibles with definite lives we acquired in connection with the acquisition of aha 
operating income 
operating income in fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher sales  as discussed above  combined with increased operating efficiencies and overhead absorption 
in addition  fiscal operating income included a million charge for in process research and development 
our mobile data communications segment s operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the significant increase in sales  as discussed above 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifier segment increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a more favorable product mix in fiscal unallocated expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of higher incentive compensation expense  as well as increased costs in connection with recent corporate governance regulations 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was the result of a partial debt prepayment during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we prepaid the balance of our long term debt in july interest income 
interest income was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of lower interest rates in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal reflects the tax benefits of among other items  research and experimentation tax credits 
the research and experimentation tax credits in fiscal more than offset the tax expense on the lower level of pre tax income  resulting in a tax benefit of million 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to the weak economic environment  particularly in our telecommunications transmission segment 
sales from our telecommunications transmission segment were million in fiscal  as compared to sales of million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
we believe sales in this segment will continue to be adversely impacted until conditions in the telecommunications industry improve 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  sales from our rf microwave amplifier segment were million as compared to million in fiscal this increase of million or was principally the result of the acquisition in april of certain assets and product lines of mpd technologies  inc our rf microwave amplifier segment represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal sales from our mobile data communications segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to increased sales of our movement tracking system to the us army 
sales from this segment represented and of total net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no customers in fiscal or which constituted or more of our total net sales other than the u 
s 
governement 
international sales represented of total net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal domestic commercial sales represented of total net sales as compared to in fiscal and sales to the us government and its agencies represented and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the reduced total level of sales discussed above 
gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven by the significant decrease in telecommunications transmission segment sales which generally carry higher margins than sales from the other two segments 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease is related to the reduction in sales during fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
despite the softness in sales discussed above  we are continuing to invest in the future by enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which amounts are not reflected in the reported research and development expenses 
in process research and development 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of advanced hardware architectures  inc  million of the purchase price was allocated to in process research and development 
this allocation was part of the overall purchase price allocation performed by an independent third party 
the value of in process research and development is based upon new product development projects that were underway at the time of the acquisition and are expected to eventually lead to new products but had not yet established technological feasibility and for which no future alternative use was identified 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of this amount 
there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
separate intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of fiscal if sfas no 
had been effective august   approximately million of amortization expense would not have been expensed in fiscal operating income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we had operating income from continuing operations of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the in process research and development charge in fiscal  operating income was million 
interest expense 
interest expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additional interest on borrowings in connection with the acquisition of mpd technologies  inc in april were more than offset by interest savings from the prepayment of million of debt in august interest income 
interest income was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was the result of a lower level of investable funds during fiscal  as well as lower interest rates 
other  net 
our other income for fiscal was  as compared to other expense of million for fiscal the amount in fiscal primarily related to the loss realized upon the sale in march of a short term investment classified as available for sale  offset by royalty and other income received of million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
during fiscal  the company conducted an independent study and identified certain research and experimentation tax credits  relating to the current and prior years  which can be used to offset regular income taxes 
the total amount of these credits more than offset the provision for income taxes 
the net effect was a benefit of million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents position increased to million at july  from million at july  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal such amount reflects i net income of million  plus the impact of non cash items such as depreciation  amortization and provisions for inventory and bad debt reserves aggregating million and ii changes in working capital balances  most notably an increase in deferred service revenue of million relating to our movement tracking system contract with the us army 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
cash of million was used for capital expenditures and million was used for the purchase of a technology license 
in march  we acquired certain satellite bandwidth control technology for million in cash and established comtech vipersat networks  inc these uses of cash were offset by million we received in connection with the final adjustment to the aha purchase price 
net cash provided by financing activities was million 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction 
aggregate proceeds from the sale  net of related costs  were million 
we utilized the proceeds to prepay the balance of our long term debt 
the entire million of long term debt outstanding as of july  was repaid in fiscal in addition  we made principal payments on capital lease obligations aggregating million 
we also received proceeds of million in connection with stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock purchase plan shares 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments as of july  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
at july  we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt related to capital lease obligations and to make payments under operating leases 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows obligations due by fiscal years in thousands and and after total capital lease obligations  operating lease commitments      total contractual cash obligations      we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
cash we have pledged against such agreements aggregating million has been classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we identify a significant acquisition that requires additional cash  we would seek to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital

this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements and risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements including statements concerning the future of our industry  product development  business strategy  continued acceptance of our products  market growth  and dependence on significant customers 
these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k 
the risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this form k could cause our actual results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
due to many factors  including the amount of business represented by large contracts  our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be volatile 
we have experienced  and will experience in the future  significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
one reason for this is that a significant portion of our business primarily the over the horizon microwave systems of our telecommunications transmission business segment  a portion of our rf microwave amplifier business segment and the majority of our mobile data communications segment is derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of which cannot be predicted 
while we generally recognize revenue on contracts when the products are shipped  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method when the performance of a contract will extend beyond a month period 
our net sales and operating results also may vary significantly from period to period because of the following factors product mix sold  fluctuating market demand  price competition  new product introductions by our competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems  political instability  regulatory developments  and general economic conditions 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as indications of our future performance because these comparisons may not be meaningful 
our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial position depend on our ability to maintain our level of government business 
the recent slowdown in our commercial business  particularly in the telecommunications and aviation sectors  has increased our dependence on us government business 
our sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government accounted for approximately  and of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we expect such business to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
us government business exposes us to various risks  including o unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions  o unpredictable order placements  reductions or cancellations  o reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes  budget cuts and other spending priorities  o penalties arising from post award contract audits  o cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced  o higher than expected final costs  particularly relating to software and hardware development  for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price  and o unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures  including government approval of final indirect rates 
all of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience 
termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination 
in addition to the right of the us government to terminate  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract may not be fully funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if  as and when appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
the us government may review our costs and performance on certain contracts  as well as our accounting and general business practices 
based on the result of such audits  the us government may adjust our contract related costs and fees 
we obtain us government contracts through a competitive bidding process 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sufficient net sales to result in profitability 
all of our businesses are subject to rapid technological change  we must keep pace with changes to compete successfully 
we are engaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
the introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly  and our business position depends  in large part  on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development  either through internal research and development or acquisitions  of new or enhanced products and technologies 
we may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost effective fashion 
a significant technological breakthrough by others  including smaller competitors or new firms  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on international sales may adversely affect us 
sales for use by international customers including sales to prime contractors international customers represented approximately  and of our total net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders for use by foreign customers 
we expect that international sales will continue to be a substantial portion of our total sales 
these sales expose us to certain risks  including barriers to trade  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may make our products less price competitive  political and economic instability  exposure to public health epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  availability of suitable export financing  tariff regulations  and other us and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products and the generally greater difficulties of doing business abroad 
we attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers  contracts denominated in us dollars  advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor 
however  we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries  in all instances 
foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government 
in addition  certain of our products and systems may require licenses from us government agencies for export from the united states  and some of our products are not permitted to be exported 
we cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products  and failure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outside the united states 
a slowing economy and continued reduction in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets 
since the second half of fiscal  our revenues from commercial customers have been negatively affected by the uncertain economic environment both in the overall market  and more specifically in the telecommunications and aviation sectors 
if the economy continues to slow  some of our customers may further reduce their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems 
as a consequence  our current customers and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce or even forego the purchase of our products and systems  which could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets  particularly in our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifier segments  which are exposed to the telecommunications and aviation sectors 
our mobile data communications business is subject to risk 
although fiscal sales and earnings increased significantly over prior years  our mobile data communications business has a relatively limited operating history compared to our other business segments 
it is subject to all of the risks inherent in the operation of a new business enterprise 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  the risk factors applicable to our mobile data communications services business include the following o although the us army contract obligates us to provide satellite services and hardware  including mobile satellite transceivers and computers  over an eight year period as and when ordered by the us army and at the fixed prices and other terms set forth in this contract  the us army is not obligated to purchase any terminals or services under this contract and may terminate this contract 
sales under the us army contract could be subject to unpredictable funding and deployment decisions 
through july   we have received orders for million under this contract 
o certain components that we need have purchasing lead time of four months or longer  and the us army contract requires us to provide mobile terminals within days after we receive an order 
o our success in commercial markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to access the best distribution channels  the development or licensing of applications which create value for the customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
delays in delivering terminals could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain commercial customers 
o in general  as we seek to grow our mobile data communications services business  we anticipate that we will need to maintain a substantial inventory in order to provide terminals to our customers on a timely basis 
if forecasted orders are not received  we might be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals 
this could result in an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
o we lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from third party satellite networks 
we currently have a long term lease that expires on june  with a satellite network operator  mobile satellite ventures  for satellite coverage in north america  central america and the northern rim of south america 
we have leases with other vendors for satellite coverage in other parts of the world as required by the us army contract 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient satellite capacity or geographical coverage from any vendor to operate our mobile data communications services system on acceptable terms or on a timely basis 
o there are several existing competitors in the mobile data communications market that have established systems with sizable customer bases and much greater financial resources than us 
the largest of these competitors is qualcomm  inc existing competitors  including terrestrial service providers  are also aggressively pricing their products and services and may continue to do so in the future 
competitors continue to offer new value added products and services  which we may be unable to match on a timely or cost effective basis 
increased competition may impact margins throughout the industry 
we anticipate that new competitors will enter the mobile data communications market in the future 
this could impact our entry into the commercial market in a significant way 
o all satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service 
interruptions in service could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
at present  one of our satellite providers  is operating without a full in orbit back up capability in the event of a failure of one of its two satellites in operation 
should we be obliged to restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure  our costs would increase and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operation  liquidity and financial position 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification 
we currently have a backlog of orders  mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate 
we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in net sales 
our dependence on component availability  subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers may adversely affect us 
we do not generally maintain a substantial inventory of components and subsystems 
we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources  but believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors 
a significant interruption in the delivery of such items  however  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our fixed price contracts subject us to risk 
almost all of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts 
this means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological  manufacturing  supply or other problems  price increases or increases in the cost of performance 
adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products 
our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various government regulations  including those of the federal communications commission fcc 
regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum  and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment  could materially harm our business by restricting development efforts by us and our customers  making our current products less attractive or obsolete  or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
changes in  or our failure to comply with  applicable regulations could materially harm our business 
in addition  the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies world wide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services 
the reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused and may continue to cause our customers to cancel  postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite  over the horizon microwave  or terrestrial line of sight microwave communication systems 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers 
we face risks from the uncertainty of prevailing economic and political conditions 
current global political and economic conditions are uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of expansion  if any  for the global or us economies generally or the markets in which we participate 
because our budgeting and forecasting process relies on estimates of growth in the markets we serve  the current economic environment renders estimates of future income and expenses even more difficult than usual to formulate 
the future direction of the domestic and global economies and political environment could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
acquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention  results may fall short of expectations 
we intend to continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses or in process research and development charges related to intangible assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including o difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  o diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and o potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business 
the loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel  including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries 
many of our key personnel  particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries  would be difficult to replace  and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements 
our growth and future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations is intense 
although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and keeping key personnel  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably 
also  the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more commercially effective than our own 
we expect the department of defense s increased use of commercial off the shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market 
also  although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries  we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our businesses rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon the laws of unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
these efforts allow us to rely upon the knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our existing products and to develop new products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated 
if the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology  we could be required to change our business practices  license the protected technology  and or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party 
if we are unable to license protected technology used in our business or if we were required to change our business practices  we could be prohibited from making and selling our products or providing certain telecommunications services 
our operations are subject to environmental regulation 
we are subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products  particularly in the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our comtech antenna systems  inc subsidiary 
we believe that we are currently in compliance  in all material respects  with such regulations and that we have obtained all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made  the nasdaq national market has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies  such as us  that are listed on the nasdaq national market 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we could incur as a result 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  and threats of war elsewhere may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states and against united states interests overseas  the us government s response thereto  and threats of war may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include o future announcements concerning us or our competitors  o receipt or non receipt of substantial orders for products and services  o results of technological innovations  o new commercial products  o changes in recommendations of securities analysts  o government regulations  o proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  o changes in economic conditions generally  particularly in the telecommunications sector  o changes in market conditions generally  particularly in the market for small cap stocks  and o limited public float 
shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid a cash dividend and do not intend to declare any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
provisions in our corporate documents  stockholder rights plan  and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of comtech 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stock could have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or which could delay  defer  or prevent a change in control of comtech 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  this statute provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination includes mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  for purposes of section of the delaware general corporation law  an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates  owns  or within three years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of comtech 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and short term us treasury securities 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes on its available cash balances 
the company s long term debt was at fixed rates 
as such  the company s earnings and cash flows were not sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company prepaid its long term debt in full in july
