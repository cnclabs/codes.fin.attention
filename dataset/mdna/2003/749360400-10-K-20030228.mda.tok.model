the company has executed a regional strategy to better leverage its consulting services offering 
the company centrally manages its solutions practices to maximize the potential for sales and marketing of those services 
many of the company s clients are facing challenging economic times 
this is creating uncertainty in their ability to pursue technology projects  which had previously been considered a competitive imperative 
many clients have laid off portions of their own permanent staff and greatly reduced the demand for consulting services in attempts to maintain profitability 
this has had a direct impact on rcm s revenues 
management believes that most companies have recognized the importance of the internet and information management technologies to competing in today s business climate 
however  the uncertain economic environment has curtailed many companies motivation for rapid adoption of many technological enhancements 
the process of designing  developing and implementing software solutions has become increasingly complex 
management believes that many companies today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing the initiatives they undertake 
this has had the effect of delaying or totally negating spending on many emerging new solutions  which management formerly anticipated 
nonetheless  it managers must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms  operating systems  databases and networking protocols  and must implement packaged software applications to support existing business objectives 
companies also need to continually keep pace with new developments  which often render existing equipment and internal skills obsolete 
consequently  business drivers cause it managers to support increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value  while working under budgetary  personnel and expertise constraints 
this has given rise to increasing demand for outsourcing 
the company believes that its clients  as well as entities that may be potential clients  are increasingly evaluating the potential for outsourcing business critical applications and entire business functions 
the company presently realizes revenues from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end to end solutions 
these services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the company s consultants based upon their skill level  experience and the type of work performed 
the company also provides project management and consulting work which are billed either by an agreed upon fixed fee or hourly rates  or a combination of both 
the billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions work are higher than those for professional consulting services 
the company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solution and project management services 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued the majority of the company s services are provided under purchase orders 
contracts are utilized on more of the complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary 
contracts  although they normally relate to longer term and more complex engagements  generally do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on to days notice 
revenues are recognized when services are provided 
costs of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation related expenses for billable consultants  including payroll taxes  employee benefits and insurance 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development  recruiting  operating activities and training  and include corporate overhead expenses 
corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities  including the company s corporate marketing  administrative and reporting responsibilities and acquisition program 
the company records these expenses when incurred 
depreciation relates primarily to the fixed assets of the company 
amortization in relates to a covenant not to compete resulting from one of the company s acquisitions 
these acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for financial reporting purposes and have created goodwill 
see footnote to financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from several sources 
all of the company s segments perform staffing services 
the company s professional engineering services and information technology services segments also perform project services 
the information technology services segment also derives revenue from permanent placement fees 
staffing services revenues derived from staffing services are recorded on a gross basis as services are performed and associated costs have been incurred using employees of the company 
in these circumstances  the company assumes the risk of acceptability of its employees to its customers 
project services project services are generally provided on a cost plus fixed fee or time and material basis 
typically  a customer will outsource a discrete project or activity and the company assumes responsibility for performance of the function or project 
the company recognizes revenues and associated costs on a gross basis as services are performed and costs are incurred using its employees 
in instances where project services are provided on a fixed price basis  and the contract will extend beyond a month period  revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract 
in some instances  revenue is billed and recorded at the time certain milestones are reached  as defined in the contract 
in other instances  revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour 
in addition some contracts contain performance fees bonuses for completing a contract under budget 
performance fees  if any  are recorded when the contract is completed and the revenue is reasonably certain of collection 
some contracts also limit revenues and billings to maximum amounts 
expenses related to contracts that extend beyond a month period are charged to cost of services as incurred 
permanent placement fees the company earns permanent placement fees 
fees for placements are recognized at the time the candidate commences employment 
based upon the company s historical experience  the company s refunds to customers have been immaterial 
however  an allowance for such refunds is recorded in the financial statements 
revenues are recorded on a gross basis as a component of revenue 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its critical accounting policies include those described below 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
goodwill and intangibles pursuant to the adoption of sfas  the company changed its accounting policy related to goodwill and intangible assets  effective january  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are subject to periodic impairment assessment 
the transitional impairment testing for such assets was completed during the second quarter of and as of january   the transition date  there was no impairment to such assets 
for purposes of the annual impairment testing  the company determined the fair value of its reporting units using relative market multiples for comparable businesses  as of november  the company compared the fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying values  including related goodwill  which resulted in an impairment loss of approximately million 
future changes in the industry could impact the market multiples of comparable businesses  and consequently could impact the results of future annual impairment tests 
in addition  the company recognizes contingent consideration from past acquisitions  which are based on earn out agreements  as additional goodwill when earned 
the company cannot be assured that earn out provisions will be met 
based on the results of future impairment testing  the company could be required to incur further impairment losses

the most significant compensatory damages claim  under the registration rights agreement  sought the difference between the amount for which plaintiffs could have sold their rcm shares during the month period ended march   but for the alleged wrongful limitation on their sales  and the amount for which the plaintiffs sold their shares during that period and thereafter 
the claim relating to the wrongful termination of the employment of one of the plaintiffs and the claims of both plaintiffs concerning the grant of stock options were resolved in binding arbitration in early a trial on the remaining claims commenced on december  and a verdict was returned on january   consisting of the jury finding in favor of the plaintiffs regarding the alleged wrongful limiting of the number of shares that plaintiffs could sell during the month period ended march   the judge and jury rejected the other claims

if sfas had been in effect on january   net loss per share would have been per share for fiscal as compared to a net loss per share of for goodwill impairment 
as a result of the softness experienced in the it sector and the resultant revenue decline  management had been closely monitoring the operating results of its it branches throughout the year  instituting significant reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses and increasing efforts to revitalize sales levels 
however  during the fourth quarter  given the current economic environment and continued reduction of capital spending on technology  management determined that operating performance of certain of its branches indicated that the possibility of impairment of goodwill arising at acquisition might be impaired 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of november  in accordance with sfas no 
the company determined the fair value of its reporting units using relative market multiples for comparable businesses 
the company compared the fair value of each of its reporting units to their respective carrying values  including related goodwill

however  during the fourth quarter  given the current economic environment and continued reduction of capital spending on technology  management determined that operating performance of certain of its branches indicated that the possibility of impairment of goodwill arising at acquisition might be impaired 
based on current operating results and existing business conditions  management projected cash flows for these branches and compared such projected flows to the carrying value of the respective branch s goodwill 
the analysis revealed that goodwill amounting to approximately million million after taxes had been impaired and  therefore  would not be recoverable through future profitable operations of these branches 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided million of cash for fiscal as compared to operating activities providing million of cash for fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the collection of an income tax refund receivable 
investing activities used million for the fiscal as compared to million for the comparable period

the million outstanding balance under the term loan facility was repaid on july   thereby canceling the term loan facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on of the aggregate amount of accounts receivable as to which not more than ninety days have elapsed since the date of the original invoice 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates  as selected by the company 
these alternatives are libor london interbank offered rate  plus applicable margin  or the agent bank s prime rate 
as cash flow permits and depending on interest rate movements  the company may  from time to time and subject to a nominal prepayment fee  apply available cash flows to reduce the revolving credit facility

the company is involved in litigation as described in footnote contingencies to the financial statements 
if material adverse determinations on either the lawsuits or claims were to be rendered  such determinations will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period of the respective charges as well as a material adverse impact on the financial position and liquidity of the company

as the size of the company and its financial resources increase  however  acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise 
in order to pursue such opportunities  the company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to the company s future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio and debt instruments  which primarily consist of its line of credit 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as of december   the company s investments consisted of cash and money market funds 
the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate changes 
presently the impact of a approximately basis points increase in interest rates on its variable debt using average debt balances during the year ended december  and average interest rates would have a relatively nominal impact on the company s results of operations 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio
