item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies revenues on long term contracts performed within the company s light military support equipment  heavy military support equipment and electronics and automation systems segments  substantially all of which are with the us government  are recognized under the percentage of completion method and include a proportion of the earnings that are expected to be realized on the contract in the ratio that production measures  primarily labor  incurred bear to the estimated production measures for the contract 
earnings expectations are based upon estimates of contract values and costs at completion 
contracts in process are reviewed on a periodic basis 
adjustments to revenues and earnings are made in the current accounting period based upon revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are recorded when identified 
during the year ended october   the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of engineered specialty plastics  inc esp  a wholly owned subsidiary representing the entirety of the plastic products segment 
the company expects that disposition through the sale of esp will be completed during the first six months of in conjunction with this plan  the company recorded an after tax estimated loss on disposal of million to reduce the carrying value of esp s net assets to their estimated fair value less estimated selling costs 
accordingly  the company has reported the results of operations of esp as discontinued operations for the years ended october   and in the consolidated statements of income

the company anticipates annual savings  net of income tax  from the restructuring plan of million to million beginning in see note d in the consolidated financial statements 
emerging issues task force eitf provides specific requirements as to the appropriate recognition of restructuring costs associated with employee termination benefits and other exit costs 
employee termination costs are recognized when benefit arrangements are communicated to affected employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the amount of benefits to be received upon termination 
other costs resulting from the restructuring plan that are not associated with or that do not benefit activities that will be continued are recognized at the date of commitment to the plan subject to certain conditions 
for the cost to be accrued  the cost must not be associated with or incurred to generate revenues after the commitment date  and it must be either incremental to other costs incurred prior to the commitment date  or represent amounts under a contractual obligation that existed prior to the commitment date that will either continue after the plan is completed with no economic benefit or which will result in a penalty to cancel the obligation 
other costs directly related to the restructuring plan which are not eligible for recognition at the commitment date  such as relocation and other integration costs  are expensed as incurred 
the following analysis should be read in this context

during  the company acquired two companies operating in the defense industry 
effective may   the company acquired substantially all the capital stock of radian inc radian  a provider of engineering services  asset protection security systems and power generation equipment to the us department of defense dod  for approximately million in cash and company common stock 
in conjunction with the radian acquisition  the company recorded million in customer related intangibles  which are being amortized over the weighted average of the related customer contracts estimated useful lives of years 
effective june   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of universal power systems  inc upsi  a provider of uninterruptible power supply systems to the dod  intelligence agencies and commercial customers 
the purchase price was approximately million plus certain contingent cash consideration based upon upsi s net revenue levels through october  each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase and is included in the light military support equipment segment 
after allocating the respective purchase prices to the fair value of all identifiable tangible and intangible assets  goodwill of million was recorded 
in accordance with the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective november   recorded goodwill balances are no longer being amortized 
goodwill amortization totaled million  or million after income tax  in year ended october results of continuing operations net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expense restructuring expense income from operations interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income the company operates in three business segments light military support equipment  heavy military support equipment  and electronics and automation systems 
the light military support equipment segment engineers and manufactures a broad range of military support equipment primarily for the dod  as well as related air handling equipment for domestic commercial and industrial users 
the segment also provides engineering services and asset protection security systems to the dod and other us government customers 
segment products include environmental control systems  generator sets and related power generation and distribution equipment  chemical and biological protection systems  petroleum and water systems and other multipurpose military support equipment 
the heavy military support equipment segment engineers and manufactures aircraft load management and transport systems primarily for the dod 
the electronics and automation systems segment engineers and manufactures airborne radar systems  reconnaissance  surveillance and target acquisition systems and avionics test equipment primarily for the dod 
the segment also manufactures material handling equipment for the us postal service 
the following table sets forth net revenues and income from operations for the years ended october   and for each of the company s business segments dollars in millions year ended october net revenues light military support equipment heavy military support equipment electronics and automation systems total income from operations light military support equipment heavy military support equipment electronics and automation systems total compared to consolidated net revenues increased million  or  in to million from million in the increase is primarily attributable to higher net revenues in the light military support equipment segment from the inclusion of the net revenues of radian of million and upsi of million since their respective acquisition dates

compared to consolidated net revenues increased million  or  in to million from million in the increase was primarily a result of higher production levels in the electronics and automation systems and the heavy military support equipment segments 
gross profit for increased million  or  in to million of consolidated net revenues from million of consolidated net revenues in the increase in gross profit was a result of higher net revenues and improved performance on several key programs  as discussed below 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  in to million of consolidated net revenues from million of consolidated net revenues in as a result of the above income from operations increased by million  or  in to million from million in light military support equipment 
net revenues for the light military support equipment segment decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenues related to the completion of certain long term contracts during the year 
this decrease was partially offset by higher production levels on some key continuing programs 
gross profit for the segment increased by million  or  in to million of segment net revenues from million of segment net revenues in the increase in gross profit and gross margin can be attributed to improved contract performance on certain key programs  including tactical quiet generator tqg and chemical biological protected shelter cbps 
income from operations decreased by million  or  in to million from million in the decrease was primarily a result of the increased selling  general and administrative expense partially offset by improved contract performance as mentioned above 
heavy military support equipment 
net revenues for the heavy military support equipment segment increased by million  or  in to million from million in a labor stoppage occurring at this segment s manufacturing facilities early in negatively impacted segment revenues by approximately million to million 
gross profit for the segment increased by million  or  in to million of segment net revenues from million of segment net revenues in the increase in gross profit can be attributed to increased revenues as previously mentioned and improved gross margins on existing contracts

gross profit for the segment increased by million  or  in to million of segment net revenues from million of segment net revenues in the increase in gross profit can be attributed to increased revenues as previously mentioned  while the decrease in margin was a result of a less favorable contract mix than in income from operations increased by million  or  in to million from million in as a result of the increased revenues  partially offset by an increase in higher operating costs 
discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations totaled million  net of income taxes  in both and annual fluctuations in segment net revenues  gross profit and operating expenses were not significant 
net interest expense decreased by million to million in as a result of lower outstanding borrowings on the company s revolving and term debt credit facilities compared to and due to a decrease in interest rates throughout the company s effective borrowing rate decreased from at october  to at october  the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively  resulting in total income tax expense of million in and million in the reduction in the company s effective income tax rate resulted from the implementation of various tax planning strategies during the year 
as a result of the foregoing  net income increased to million of consolidated net revenues in as compared to million of consolidated net revenues in outlook for and future years for  the company is forecasting a to increase in consolidated net revenues to approximately million for the year  without consideration for any potential future acquisitions 
the company anticipates that the inclusion for an entire year of the operations of radian and upsi  both acquired during  will contribute most significantly to this increase in net revenues 
the company anticipates that cash flows generated from operating earnings growth will be used to continue to pay down existing bank debt in  reducing interest costs to approximately million for the year 
reflecting the above forecasted assumptions  the company expects net income from continuing operations to increase approximately in in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to periodic impairment tests 
all other intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives 
in addition  sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations 
the company adopted sfas and sfas as of november  the company has identified its reporting units to be its operating subsidiaries with the exception of systems electronics inc sei  which comprises two reporting units the heavy military support equipment and the electronics and automation systems segments of the company 
the carrying value of each reporting unit as of november  was determined by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to the reporting units 
upon adoption of sfas  amortization of goodwill ceased 
the company has performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment as of november  and a goodwill impairment assessment as of october  neither assessment resulted in impairment of goodwill 
an annual impairment test will be performed in the fourth quarter of each year 
under sfas  the company also capitalized and is amortizing acquired identifiable intangible assets 
in conjunction with its acquisition of radian  the company capitalized acquired identifiable intangible assets related to radian s existing long term government contracts at a value of approximately million and recorded related amortization expense of million  or million  net of income tax 
the company expects to record million annually in intangible asset amortization expense over the weighted average duration of the related customer contracts of years 
the company continues to believe that significant growth opportunities exist within the military support equipment  electronics and services related segments of the defense industry in response to i the current fragmentation within the industry  ii the dod s emphasis on awarding contracts on the basis of best value  iii the dod s increasing reliance on the engineering and design capabilities of contractors  iv heightened military operations around the globe  and  v overall increases in defense spending by the dod 
the company s focus for includes the continued rationalization of its existing defense operations in order to leverage its infrastructure and achieve additional operational synergies  as well as the continued integration of its recently acquired radian and upsi operations 
the company continues to review potential defense acquisitions in both the manufacturing and services areas 
any such transaction must be accretive to earnings  must bring significant increases in revenues and backlog  and must provide long term value to the company s shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital needs are generally funded through cash flow from operations and the revolving line of credit 
at october   the company s working capital and ratio of current assets to current liabilities were million and to  respectively  compared with million and to a year ago 
the reductions in working capital and in the current ratio in are a result of the use of existing cash balances and the revolving line of credit to fund the radian and upsi acquisitions combined cash purchase price of million during the year  offset by significant operating cash flows 
the company generated operating cash flows of million in compared to million in the significant improvement in cash flow generation reflects increased net income  the income tax benefit of non qualified stock options deducted in the current year and improved working capital management 
investment in property  plant and equipment totaled million and million  respectively  in and the company anticipates that capital expenditures in should not exceed million and will primarily be used for expansion of the keco manufacturing facility  as well as certain improvements at other facilities 
management believes that cash flow generated from operations  together with the available line of credit  will provide the necessary resources to meet the needs of the company for the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the acquisition of sei in september  the company entered into a credit agreement which provided a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the company s primary sources of short term financing are from cost reimbursements under contracts with the us government via receipt of progress payments  billings for delivered products and borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
as of october   the company had million outstanding against the revolving line of credit  remaining availability under the revolving line of credit of million and a cash balance of million 
committed amounts total contractual and contingent obligations as of october  are as follows in millions payments expiration less than one to four to over one year three years five years five years total contractual obligations short term borrowings long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations contingent obligations letters of credit additional consideration related to upsi acquisition total obligations while contingent obligations are included in the table above  the company does not expect to fund the full amounts indicated for letters of credit 
in addition  million represents the company s estimate of the maximum amount of additional consideration related to the upsi acquisition 
on november   the company adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas the effect of adopting sfas was immaterial based on the fair value of the company s derivative instruments at the date of adoption 
during the year ended october   the company s derivative contracts consisted only of interest rate swaps used by the company to convert a portion of its variable rate long term debt to fixed rates 
at october   the company recorded a liability of million related to the fair value of those interest rate swap agreements  which are designated as and considered highly effective cash flow hedges of the company s forecasted variable rate interest payments 
the entire corresponding loss  net of income tax  is recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the company does not expect to reclassify any of the loss to current earnings in inflation since a significant portion of the company s contracts with the dod are at fixed prices  inflation can affect the ultimate profit to be realized on them 
some contracts have price adjustment provisions that limit the impact of inflation on profits 
in addition  the company s volume purchasing and forward purchasing policies serve to limit the effects of inflation 
the company considers potential inflation in preparation of contract proposals and bids 
in addition  the company s commercial and industrial products are predominantly custom made 
therefore  the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant 
the company attempts to alleviate inflationary pressures on commercial and industrial products by increasing selling prices to help offset rising costs subject to competitive conditions  increasing productivity and improving manufacturing techniques 
because of these factors  management does not believe that inflation has had  or that anticipated inflation will have  a significant effect on the company s operations

sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas the company adopted sfas effective november  in the year ended october   the company accounted for the planned disposition through sale of esp as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities
