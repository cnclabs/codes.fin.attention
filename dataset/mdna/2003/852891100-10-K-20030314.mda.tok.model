item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business developments 
in addition to product specific reinsurance arrangements  we have maintained reinsurance coverage in the past for certain catastrophe losses 
subsequent to the terrorist events of september   the availability of reinsurance for catastrophe coverage became less certain and more expensive 
accordingly  we entered into a catastrophe reinsurance pool with other insurance companies 
this pool spreads catastrophe losses on group life and accidental death and dismemberment over approximately participating members of the pool 
the reinsurance pool exposes us to potential losses experienced by other participating members of the pool 
however  through this pool  our catastrophe reinsurance coverage increased to approximately million per event 
if the company had been in the pool on september   the estimated pre tax charges related to the terrorist events would have been approximately million compared to pre tax charges of million actually incurred

the terrorism risk insurance act of provides for federal government assistance to property and casualty insurers in the event of material losses due to terrorist acts on behalf of a foreign person or foreign interest 
the legislation also provides for the united states treasury department to conduct an expedited study to determine if there should be federal assistance for group life insurers in the event of material losses due to terrorist acts 
group life insurance represents a significant portion of our revenues and operating income 
concentration of risk is inherent in the group life insurance products we offer 
we have group life insurance exposure to certain customers in amounts in excess of our catastrophe reinsurance coverage
