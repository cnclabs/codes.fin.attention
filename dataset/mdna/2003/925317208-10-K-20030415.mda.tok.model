table of contents risk factors the company may be unable to fund future growth 
the company s business strategy calls for growth internally as well as through acquisitions 
this growth will require funding for additional personnel  capital expenditures and other expenses  as well as for working capital purposes 
financing may not be available to the company on favorable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  then the company may not be able to meet its business objectives for expansion 
this in turn could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if the company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  then the percentage of ownership of the company s existing shareholders will be reduced  and any new securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the common stock 
furthermore  if the company raises capital or acquires businesses by incurring indebtedness  then the company will become subject to the risks associated with indebtedness  including interest rate fluctuations and any financial or other covenants that the company s lender may require 
the company may not become profitable 
the company has a history of net losses  including net losses of approximately million for the fiscal year  million for the fiscal year and million for the fiscal year as of december   the company had accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company s revenues may not increase  and the company may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability 
the price of the common stock has been volatile 
the stock market in general  and the market for technology companies in particular  has recently experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
from january  to september   the per share closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq national market fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
from september  to march   the per share closing price of the common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market fluctuated from a high of to a low of 
the company believes that the volatility of the price of its common stock does not necessarily relate to the company s performance and is broadly consistent with volatility experienced in the company s industry 
fluctuations may occur  among other reasons  in response to operating results  announcements by competitors  regulatory changes  economic changes  market valuation of technology firms  and general market conditions 
additionally  the company s operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of the common stock to decline 
the trading price of the common stock could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to these or other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
if the market price of the common stock decreases  then shareholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock at a profit 
the low price of the common stock could result in the delisting of the common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
the common stock is currently quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the company must satisfy certain minimum listing maintenance requirements to maintain such quotation  including a series of financial tests relating to net tangible assets  public float  number of market makers and shareholders  market capitalization  and maintaining a minimum bid price of per share for the common stock 
in the past  the company has had difficulty maintaining the minimum bid price for the common stock 
prior to september   the common stock was quoted on the nasdaq national market 
on june   the nasdaq national market notified the company that the bid price of the common stock had closed at less than per share over the previous consecutive trading days  and as a result  the company did not comply with the minimum bid price continued listing requirement of the nasdaq national market 
the company was then provided calendar days  or until september   to regain compliance with the 
table of contents minimum bid price requirement 
the company was unable to regain compliance  and on september   the company transferred the common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
the company was afforded the remainder of the calendar day grace period established by the nasdaq smallcap market  or until december   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share requirement 
although the company did not regain compliance of the minimum bid price per share requirement by december   the company did meet the nasdaq smallcap market s other listing requirements and was given until june   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
recently  the nasdaq small cap market granted the company an additional days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  giving the company until september   to regain compliance 
although the nasdaq stock market currently has a proposal before the sec that would grant an additional grace period to companies with bid price deficiencies  there can be no assurances that the sec will approve such proposal 
if the company is not able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by september   then the common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
if the common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  then the common stock may trade on the over the counter bulletin board  or its successor  the bulletin board exchange  both of which are viewed by most investors as less desirable and less liquid market places 
delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market could make trading the common stock more difficult for the company s investors  leading to further declines in share price 
delisting of the common stock would also make it more difficult and expensive for the company to raise additional capital 
furthermore  delisting of the common stock is an event of default under the company s outstanding convertible debentures and  through certain cross default provisions  the loan and security agreement the company entered into with clarent in connection with the clarent asset purchase and the credit agreement with silicon 
historically low trading volume in the common stock may affect shareholder liquidity 
the trading volume of the common stock has been low historically

low trading volume may result in shareholders being unable to sell shares of common stock at the times and at the prices they desire 
the company is exposed to the general condition of the telecommunications market 
the company s business is subject to global economic conditions  and in particular  market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
the company s operations could be adversely affected if declines in capital spending from telecommunications service providers continue 
if global economic conditions worsen  or if there is a prolonged slowdown in the telecommunications industry  then the company may experience adverse operating results 
the market for next generation communications solutions is new and evolving and  if this market does not develop as the company expects  then it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company believes there is a significant growth opportunity in providing next generation communications solutions to communications service providers  there can be no assurances that this technology will be widely accepted or that a viable market for the company s products will fully develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than the company expects  then the company may not be able to sell its products in significant volume  or at all 
further  the company believes that  with the its recent acquisitions  it is positioned to succeed in leveraging the competencies acquired with these acquisitions to develop solutions for communication service providers 
however  because of the intense competition in the market and the recent introduction of this technology  there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in this evolving marketplace 

table of contents intellectual property infringement claims against the company  even without merit  could require the company to enter into costly licenses or deprive the company of the technology it needs

there can be no assurance that these patents will be issued 
even if these patents are issued  the limited legal protection afforded by patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws may not be sufficient to protect the company s proprietary rights 
furthermore  the laws of many foreign countries in which the company does business do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the united states 
although the company has implemented and will continue to implement protective measures in those countries  these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  even if the company s domestic and international efforts to protect its intellectual property rights are successful  the company s competitors may independently develop non infringing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to the company s technologies 
if the company s products contain defects  then the company s sales are likely to suffer and the company may be exposed to legal claims 
the company s business strategy calls for the development of new products and product enhancements which may from time to time contain defects or result in failures that the company did not detect or anticipate when introducing such products or enhancements to the market 
in addition  the markets in which the company s products are used are characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations and by errors  failures and bugs in third party platforms that can impede proper operation of the company s products 
despite testing by the company  defects may still be discovered in some new products or enhancements after the products or enhancements are delivered to customers 
the occurrence of these defects could result in product returns  adverse publicity  loss of or delays in market acceptance of the company s products  delays or cessation of service to the company s customers  and legal claims by customers against the company

in the course of the company s business  the company may sell or lease certain equipment to the company s customers  and in connection with such sale or lease  the company may agree to indemnify these customers from claims made against them by third parties for patent infringement related to such equipment 
if the company is required to make any payments in respect of these indemnification obligations  then it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s growth could be limited if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the company believes that its success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
competition for highly skilled engineering  sales  marketing and support personnel is intense because there is a limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the company s markets 
workforce reductions by the company during   and may adversely affect the company s ability to retain its current employees and recruit new employees 
the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could hinder the company s ability to implement the company s business strategy and harm the company s business

the new softswitch and communication products which the company intends to offer may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace 
as a result of the consummation of the clarent asset purchase  the company is now able to offer products which it could not offer previously  including class softswitch products and satellite communication products 
the markets for these products are relatively new  unpredictable and evolving rapidly 
lack of acceptance in the marketplace for these new products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company expects to conduct business in new geographic markets which will subject the company and its business to new regulation and legislation and risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as a result of the consummation of the clarent asset purchase  the company has an operational presence in canada which the company did not have previously 
furthermore  although customers outside the united states and canada have historically accounted for a large portion of clarent s revenues  the company expects to conduct an even greater portion of its business in europe than clarent conducted 
consequently  the company now has the additional responsibility of complying with the legislation and regulation in these new geographic markets 
failure of the company to comply with such regulation and legislation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

the company may be subject to claims involving how the company conducts its business or the market for or issuance of its common stock or other securities 
any such claims against the company may affect the company s business  results of operations and financial conditions 
such claims  even those without merit  could require the company to pay damages or settlement amounts and would require a substantial amount of time and attention from the company s senior management as well as considerable legal expenses
