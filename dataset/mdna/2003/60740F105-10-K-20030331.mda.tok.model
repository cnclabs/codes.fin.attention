item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item  description of business factors that may affect future operating results and included in other portions of this report 
overview in  we transitioned our business to focus on the leasing of portable storage units rather than their sale 
this has caused the composition of our revenues and expenses to change 
leasing revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased steadily to in  from in the number of portable storage and office units in our lease fleet increased from  at the end of to  at the end of  representing a combined annual growth rate cagr of 
our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage and portable office units 
our sales revenues include sales of portable storage units and portable offices to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the portable storage units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are cost of sales  leasing  selling and general expenses  and depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  refurbish and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include advertising and other marketing expenses  commissions and corporate overhead for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our lease fleet units are depreciated on the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units and on wood office units 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we believe over time the use of van trailers for portable storage will become less desirable and will only be used for dock height storage and by those who must frequently move their storage units

table of contents results of operations the following table shows the percentage of total revenues represented by the key items that make up our statements of operations year ended december  revenues leasing sales other total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales leasing  selling and general expenses florida litigation expense depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses income from operations other expense interest expense income before provision for income taxes and extraordinary item provision for income taxes income before extraordinary item extraordinary item and preferred stock dividend net income available to common stockholders compared to total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted primarily from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease 
in  our internal growth rate was approximately as compared to approximately in we define internal growth as the growth in lease revenues in markets opened for at least one year  excluding any growth arising as a result of additional acquisitions in those markets 
the slowdown in our internal growth rate is principally due to general economic weakness  particularly associated with the non residential construction customer segment of our business and particularly in our more established markets 
our revenues from the sale of portable storage units increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is principally due to sales at our newer branches that were not opened during the entire year and our new branches added through acquisitions in  certain non repeat sales that occurred in  and from sales related to culling our fleet of a portion of non core products  principally van trailers 
cost of sales is the cost to us of units that we sold during the period 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  decreased to in from in this slight increase in sales margins is not significant and is partially attributable to higher margins on certain non repeat sales in  partially offset by the sales of van trailers at much lower margins than our principal products 
leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was and in and  respectively 
these expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined at older branches  as we were able to benefit from economies of scale as those branches grew 
this was offset by higher leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues at newer branches 
in general  new branches initially have lower operating margins until their fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes that typically are not achieved until the branch has been operated for several years 

table of contents florida litigation expense relates to litigation and related costs incurred in connection with our florida litigation see item of this report 
we recorded approximately million of costs and legal expenses incurred to date in connection with this suit and related litigation 
this amount is reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
future costs in connection with our florida litigation will be expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is due to higher depreciation expense on our larger lease fleet and the higher depreciation rate associated with wood mobile offices which were a larger part of our fleet in  partially offset by the lack of amortization of goodwill due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  had sfas no 
been effective for  our depreciation and amortization expenses for would have been approximately million lower than reported 
interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased  primarily due to increased borrowings under our credit facility to fund the growth of our lease fleet  including acquisitions 
this increase in borrowings was offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt to in from in excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
taking into account the amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for both and net income  before extraordinary item  increased million  or  to million in from million in excluding the effect of the florida litigation  our net income  before extraordinary item  was million in  or an increase of compared to net income 
in the first quarter of  we recognized an extraordinary charge of million  net of million in income taxes  related to the write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our prior credit agreement 
this write off was taken in connection with our entering into our new credit agreement in february compared to total revenues in increased million  or  to million from million in leasing revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase resulted from a increase in the average number of portable storage units on lease and a increase in the average rent per unit 
in  our internal growth rate was approximately 
we define internal growth as the growth in revenues in markets open one year or longer  excluding any revenues from operations acquired at locations in which we are already doing business 
our revenues from the sale of units increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales is associated only with the cost of units that we sold during this comparative period 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in from million in cost of sales  as a percentage of sales revenues  increased to in from in this slight reduction in sales margins is not significant and not attributable to any particular factors 
gross margins in were more in line with margins in and leasing  selling and general expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  was constant at in both and these expenses as a percentage of total revenues declined at older branches  as we were able to benefit from economies of scale as those branches grew 
this was offset by higher leasing  selling and general expenses as a percentage of total revenues at newer branches 
in general  new branches initially have lower operating margins until their fixed operating costs are covered by higher leasing volumes that typically are not achieved until the branch has been operated for several years 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to our larger lease fleet  including mobile offices which depreciate at a faster rate than our steel storage containers  additional transportation and manufacturing equipment and amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed in the first half of 
table of contents interest expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of higher average debt outstanding during our average debt outstanding increased  due to an additional borrowing under our credit facility to fund the growth of our business 
during  the largest portion of our growth was funded by net proceeds of million from a public equity offering in march and million of cash generated from operations 
we used some additional debt financing primarily to expand our lease fleet and fund our branch expansion 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt decreased to in from in  excluding amortization of debt issuance costs 
including amortization of debt issuance costs  the weighted average interest rate was in and in provision for income taxes was based on an annual effective tax rate of for both and net income increased million  or  to million in from million in net income as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in net income and net income as a percentage of total revenues primarily resulted from our higher leasing revenues in and the higher operating margins that occur as existing branches increase in size 
the increase in net income as a percentage of revenues was also caused in part by million of net proceeds from an equity offering in march  the proceeds were used to reduce debt  thereby reducing interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources growing our lease fleet is very capital intensive  and the amount of capital we need at any particular time is dependent principally upon the extent of growth of our lease fleet that we have targeted 
over the past three years  we have financed the growth of our lease fleet and our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from equity financings and borrowings under our credit facility and proceeds from an equity financing 
operating activities 
our operations provided net cash flow of million in  million in and million in the million increase in over in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in cash collections on a larger receivable base created from high leasing revenues and from a reduction in inventory levels 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the decrease in use of cash in resulted primarily from fewer containers and offices being added to our fleet at existing branches due to lower demand  partially offset by an increase in acquisition activity 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet were million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in  million in and million in in addition  we spent million in  million in and million in for acquisitions 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in during and  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily provided by our credit facility  which we used to expand our lease fleet and finance our branch expansion  including acquisitions 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily provided by our sale of approximately million shares of common stock in march  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
those proceeds were used to temporarily pay down our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit 
in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our other principal source of liquidity is our credit facility 
the interest rate under our credit facility is based on our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the current interest rate under our credit facility is the libor london interbank offered rate rate plus 
as of march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and approximately million of additional borrowings were currently available to us under the terms of the facility 
during  the average interest rate under the credit facilities was  including the effect of our interest rate swap agreements 
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility grew at a lower than historical rate since june  through fiscal year end due to a decrease in the rate of additions to the lease fleet and a higher level of cash flow generated from operations 
our internal growth was slower than in prior years  so most of the additional lease fleet needed to meet that growth was achieved by increasing utilization rates or funded through cash flow from operations 
borrowings available under the credit facility are based on our portable storage unit lease fleet  property  plant  equipment  and levels of inventories and receivables 
our lease fleet is appraised twice a year for purposes of the credit facility and any significant decline in the appraised value would have an adverse effect on our borrowing capacity under the facility 

table of contents in  we entered into three year interest rate swap agreements under which we effectively fixed the interest rate payable on an aggregate of million of borrowings under our credit facility so that the rate is based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
under these agreements  the interest rate payable on million  million and million of borrowings under our revolving line of credit was based upon a spread from  and  respectively  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
in august and september  we amended these interest rate swap agreements to substitute the spread from the existing fixed rates to  and  respectively 
in addition  we entered into two new interest rate swap agreements each for million at a spread from fixed rates of and rather than a spread from the libor rate 
the aggregate amount of the interest rate swap agreements at december  is million with all five agreements maturing in august the weighted average fixed interest rate on these swap agreements is plus the spread 
accounting for these swap agreements is covered by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and accordingly resulted in a charge to comprehensive income of million  net of applicable income tax benefit of million during both and we believe our working capital  together with our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and other available funding sources will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned growth for at least months 
if our operations were to generate less cash than we foresee  and if we for any reason lost our ability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement  the principal effect on our business would be to limit our ability to grow our lease fleet 
seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventory for the holiday season 
our retail customers usually return these leased units to us early in the following year 
this has caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in cash flow during the first quarter of the past several years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
mobile mini s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition mobile mini adopted staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  effective october  the adoption of sab did not materially affect the results of operations or financial position 
mobile mini recognizes revenues from sales of containers upon delivery 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage units and office units are recognized monthly which approximates a straight line basis 
revenues and expenses from portable storage unit delivery and hauling are recognized when these services are billed  in accordance with sab  as these services are considered inconsequential to the overall leasing transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and past due accounts 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable was million of our million in 
table of contents gross accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  mobile mini has tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
mobile mini has performed the first of the required impairment tests for goodwill at december  and has determined that the carrying amount of goodwill is not impaired 
mobile mini has adopted sfas effective january  application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas resulted in an increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million in impairment long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for its estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
salvage value our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over our units estimated useful life  in most cases years after the date that we put the unit in service  with estimated residual values of on steel units and on wood office units 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the larger competitors in our industry  profit margins we are achieving on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 

table of contents contingencies we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending claims and litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we do not anticipate that the resolution of such matters will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position
