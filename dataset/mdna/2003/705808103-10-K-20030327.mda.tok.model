financial condition general 
at december   total assets were million compared to million at december   representing an increase of million or 
management is committed to growing the balance sheet with quality assets that provide the appropriate yields 
the following is a discussion of the significant fluctuations between the december  and balance sheets 
assets cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million or was primarily the result of an increase in interest bearing deposits in other banks of million 
pelican national had excess liquidity resulting from increased deposits due to washtenaw maintaining all of the investor accounts related to its servicing portfolio at pelican national 
the balances in these accounts have increased as the overall servicing portfolio increased 
due to the fluctuation in balances of these accounts  pelican national typically invested the deposits in interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold 
accounts receivable 
at december   accounts receivable totaled million compared to million at december  the increase of  or was primarily the result of an increase in receivables related to the sale of mortgage servicing rights by washtenaw 
washtenaw entered into an agreement to sell mortgage loan servicing on december  a down payment was received but approximately million will be received upon transfer of the mortgage loans servicing in the first and second quarter of the million was offset by the collection of outstanding receivables from previous mortgage loans servicing sales 
loans held for sale 
at december   loans held for sale was million compared to million at december  this decrease of million or was the result of a reduction in the amount of time between the origination of the mortgage loan and the sale of the loan to the secondary market 
this improvement was due to additional employees and improved processes 
the majority of the remaining loans will be sold in the first quarter of loans receivable 
total portfolio loans were million at december   an increase of million or from at december  this increase resulted primarily from increases in commercial and residential real estate lending production at pelican national 
the increased production was offset by a significant increase in loans being paid in full 
this was caused by the numerous reductions in key interest rate drivers by the federal government 
mortgage servicing rights 
total mortgage servicing rights were million at december   a decrease of million or from million at december  the mortgage servicing portfolio increased million  or  from december  to december   as washtenaw has retained the servicing rights on a portion of current mortgage loan production 
this increase in the servicing portfolio resulted in additions to the mortgage servicing rights asset of million for the year ended december  however  these additions were more than offset by million of amortization and impairment valuation adjustments on the servicing rights and million in mortgage servicing rights sales for the year ended december  the impairment valuation adjustments were due to a significant decrease in mortgage interest rates  throughout the year resulting in increases in expected prepayment speeds  which project the expected runoff of the mortgage loan servicing portfolio based on comparing the interest rates of the loans in the portfolio against current market interest rates 
other real estate owned 
other real estate owned increased to million at december  this was an increase of million compared to  at december  the increase was the result of increased repurchases of non performing loans by washtenaw 
in prior years  washtenaw would often indemnify or reimburse the current owner of the loan 
management made the decision during the year to analyze the offers being accepted by the current holder of the loan to ensure that below market sales prices were not being accepted 
based on this analysis  washtenaw would be required to repurchase the loans  and ultimately foreclose on the property  in instances where washtenaw instructed the current holder of the loan not to accept the sales offer 
premises and equipment 
premises and equipment increased to million at december  from million at december  the million increase was the result of the purchase of the bank branch in san carlos by pelican national and several technological improvements at washtenaw 
the most significant include document imaging and an online loan submission platform for our customers 
liabilities deposits 
total deposits were million at december  compared to million at december   representing an increase of million or 
the increase was due to several factors 
washtenaw has increased its servicing portfolio  which resulted in an increase in custodial deposits on hand at the end of the year 
the remaining increase is the result of an increased focus on generating new deposits which included the opening of a third retail bank branch 
due to bank 
due to bank was million at december  compared to at december  the increase of million or was due to the increase of mortgage loan production at washtenaw in the fourth quarter of due to bank represents the drafts provided to fund the loans purchased by washtenaw that have not yet been presented and cleared the bank 
notes payable 
notes payable was million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million or was primarily caused by a decrease in the loans held for sale balance 
since the notes payable represent the warehouse line of credit that washtenaw uses to fund its loan production until such time that the loans are sold to the secondary market  the balance will generally move in direct correlation with the loans held for sale balance 
repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements were million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million or was primarily the result of a decrease in the balance of loans held for sale 
washtenaw uses repurchase agreements  in addition to its warehouse line of credit  as a means to fund the loans that it purchases 
therefore  the repurchase agreements balance will typically move in direct correlation to the loans held for sale balance 
federal home loan bank borrowings 
during the year  federal home loan bank borrowings increased from million million at december  the increase of million or was due to pelican national obtaining additional liquidity to fund the growth of its loan portfolio 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
pelican financial s net income for the year ended december l  was million or per share  diluted  compared to million or per share  diluted  for the year ended december   the decrease of million for the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in net interest income and noninterest income including servicing income and gains on sales of mortgage servicing rights offset by increases in amortization of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments 
loan production 
the volume of loans produced for the year ended december  totaled billion  as compared to billion for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of million  or approximately

compensation and benefits totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of approximately  or 
the decrease during was the result of a decrease in commissions paid to the business consultants at washtenaw due to the decreased loan production 
the decrease also was the result of a reduction in bonus compensation paid at washtenaw as a result of the reduction in earnings 
these were offset by an increase in overall compensation paid to hourly employees due to the increase in the number of employees and health care costs 
occupancy and equipment expense

for the year ended december   gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights and loans was million 
the million decrease represents a decrease between periods 
this is consistent with decrease in mortgage loan production during the years

at this time  management is not actively attempting to achieve additional financing 
pelican financial s ability to continue to purchase loans and mortgage servicing rights and to originate new loans is dependent in large part upon its ability to sell the mortgage loans at par or for a premium or to sell the mortgage servicing rights in the secondary market in order to generate cash proceeds to repay borrowings pursuant to the warehouse facility  thereby creating borrowing capacity to fund new purchases and originations 
the value of and market for pelican financial s loans and mortgage servicing rights are dependent upon a number of factors  including the borrower credit risk classification  loan to value ratios and interest rates  general economic conditions  warehouse facility interest rates  and governmental regulations

the commitments are commonly known as rate lock commitments 
at december   pelican financial had outstanding rate lock commitments to lend million for mortgage loans  along with outstanding commitments to make other types of loans totaling million 
because these commitments may expire without being drawn upon  they do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
also  as of december   pelican financial had outstanding commitments to sell million of mortgage loans 
these commitments will be funded within days 
at december   pelican national exceeded all applicable regulatory minimum capital requirements as well as the requirement to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes

impact of new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for hedge accounting is that the hedging relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows 
sfas no 
was effective beginning january  pelican financial maintains an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
while pelican national bank is subject to interest rate risk  it does not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge such risk 
however  washtenaw  through the forward sales of mortgage backed securities and purchases of mortgage backed securities put options  does make use of derivative instruments 
pelican financial believes this strategy is appropriate to manage the risks associated with interest rate volatility 
the secondary marketing department at washtenaw assesses the interest rate risk associated with the outstanding commitments it has to fund loans pipeline and loans classified as held for sale inventory 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sfas and related commitments 
washtenaw hedges the loans in inventory through the forward sales of mortgage backed securities forwards and purchases of mortgage backed securities put options options 
options are used infrequently 
therefore  management has chosen not to designate these as a hedge 
forwards will be designated as fair value hedges against the loans in inventory 
therefore  changes in the fair value of the designated forwards will be offset with the changes in values of the designated hedged loans 
effective january   sfas no 
required each company adopting it to record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle adjustment 
pelican financial recorded an adjustment of  net of tax 
this loss was the result of interest rate fluctuations from the time the forward sales of mortgage backed securities were entered into and december  the derivative implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on mortgage loan rate lock commitments to borrowers 
the guidance categorizes as derivatives rate lock commitments on loans intended for sale  and is effective july  upon adopting this guidance on july  the company recorded the fair value of rate lock commitments as derivatives  and the amount of the resulting fair value adjustments largely offset the fair value adjustments on forward sales commitments that are currently carried as derivatives 
the company recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of tax  to reflect the fair value of rate lock commitments outstanding on july new accounting standards on asset retirement obligations  restructuring activities and exit costs  operating leases  and early extinguishments of debt were issued in management determined that when the new accounting standards are adopted in they will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this annual report and form k have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of pelican financial s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of pelican financial are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on pelican financial s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

the continuous movement of interest rates is certain  however  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movements in interest rates has an effect on pelican financial s profitability 
the value of loans  which pelican financial has either originated or purchased or committed to originate or purchase  decreases as interest rates rise and conversely  the value increases as interest rates fall 
the value of mortgage servicing rights tends to move inversely to the value of loans  increasing in value as interest rates rise and decreasing in value as interest rates fall 
pelican financial also faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as loans and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
pelican financial s interest rate spread and interest margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though pelican financial generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
pelican financial s interest margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
in turn  this affects the prepayment speed of loans underlying pelican financial s mortgage servicing rights 
because it is unlikely that any particular movement in interest rates could affect only one aspect of pelican financial s business  many of pelican financial s products are naturally self hedging to each other 
for instance  the decrease in the value of pelican financial s mortgage servicing portfolio associated with a decline in interest rates usually will not occur without some degree of increase in new mortgage loan production  which may offset the decrease in the value of the mortgage servicing portfolio 
pelican financial s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all loan production into the secondary market 
this loan production is typically sold while servicing is retained 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan servicing portfolio  pelican financial typically sells the servicing for most of its loans within one year of the origination of the underlying loan 
the turnover in the loan servicing portfolio assists pelican financial in maintaining a constant value of the servicing portfolio by holding servicing on loans that are least likely to be refinanced in the short term 
pelican financial further attempts to mitigate the effects of changes in interest rates through the use of forward sales of anticipated loan closings and diligent asset and liability management 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing pelican financial is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise perspective  pelican financial manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination and loan servicing businesses  which are counter cyclical in nature 
in addition  pelican financial utilizes various hedging techniques to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to its committed pipeline loans  mortgage loan inventory  and mortgage servicing rights 
pelican financial primarily utilizes forward sales of mortgage backed securities and purchases of mortgage backed securities put options 
these instruments most closely track the performance of pelican financial s committed pipeline of loans because the loans themselves can be delivered directly into these contracts 
pelican financial may also use other hedging techniques  including the use of forward us treasury notes and bond sales and purchases long short otc cash forward contracts  us treasury futures contracts long short cbot futures  us treasury futures options contracts long short cbot futures options  private mortgage conduit mandatory forward sales mandatory rate locks  and private mortgage conduit best effort rate locks best effort rate locks 
the overall objective of pelican financial s interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
pelican financial does not speculate on the direction of interest rates in its management of interest rate risk
