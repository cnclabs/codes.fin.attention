item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
since northfield s incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to the research  development and clinical testing of our potential product  polyheme 
we have incurred operating losses during each year of our operations since inception and expect to incur substantial additional operating losses for the next several years 
from northfield s inception through may   we have incurred operating losses totaling we will be required to complete our planned phase iii clinical trials and obtain fda regulatory approval before polyheme can be sold commercially 
the fda regulatory process is subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those described above under risk factors 
we therefore cannot at this time reasonably estimate the timing of any future revenues from the commercial sale of polyheme 
the costs incurred by northfield to date and during each period presented below in connection with our development of polyheme are described in the statements of operations and in note of notes to our financial statements 
our success will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain fda regulatory approval of polyheme and our manufacturing facilities  obtain sufficient quantities of blood to manufacture polyheme in commercial quantities  manufacture and distribute polyheme in a cost effective manner  enforce our patent positions and raise sufficient capital to fund these activities 
we have experienced significant delays in the development and clinical testing of polyheme 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve these goals or that we will be able to realize product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
results of operations we reported no revenues for the fiscal years ended may   or from northfield s inception through may   we have reported total revenues of  all of which were derived from licensing fees 
operating expenses operating expenses for our fiscal years ended may   and totaled   and  respectively 
measured on a percentage basis  fiscal operating expenses exceeded fiscal expenses by  while fiscal operating expenses were lower than fiscal expenses by 
for our fiscal year  research and development expenses totaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the prior fiscal year 
lower clinical trials expense was partially offset by increased manufacturing costs as we built inventory for our upcoming clinical trials 
we are planning for a significant increase in research activity and related expense in fiscal preparation for our phase iii prehospital trial is nearing completion and patient enrollment is forecasted to start in the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
expenses directly related to the trial for fiscal year is estimated at  these expenses include per patient charges by the participating trial sites for the enrollees as well as expenses for data gathering  analysis and audit  project management  lab analysis and interim reporting 
northfield is also planning a modest employment expansion in support of the trial 
for our fiscal year  research and development expenses totaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the fiscal year 
during fiscal  northfield closed all of its then current clinical trials  except those relating to compassionate use 
the elimination of these expenses caused fiscal research and development expenses to be less than those incurred in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  compared to expenses of  for fiscal  representing an increase of  or 
the increase was due primarily to costs associated with a proxy contest in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders as well as increased costs associated with our increased public relations focus 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled  compared to expenses of  for fiscal  representing a decrease of  or 
the decrease was due primarily to reduced professional fees 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will likely increase in fiscal the cost of directors and officers liability insurance has increased by  and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding the organization in support of planning for the commercialization of polyheme 
interest income interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal interest income in fiscal equaled  representing a decrease of  or  from the  in interest income reported in fiscal significantly lower interest rates and lower available investment balances accounted for the decrease 
significantly lower interest rates and lower available investment balances account for the decrease 
currently available short term interest rates are yielding less than 
interest rates for short term high grade investments are at near record lows 
money market rates range from to  one year certificates of deposit are quoted at and other investment types provide similar returns 
the combination of extremely low available rates and the accelerating use of cash will combine to cause fiscal interest income to be significantly below fiscal interest income 
net loss the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the loss per share is primarily the result of the reduction in interest income  expenses relating to our annual meeting of stockholders and increased professional services 
the net loss for our fiscal year ended may  was  or 
per share  compared to a net loss of  or 
per share  for the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the loss per share is primarily the result of the reduction in interest income 
fiscal operating expenses were  less than those incurred in fiscal  while interest income in fiscal was  less than the interest income earned in fiscal liquidity and capital resources from northfield s inception through may   we have used cash in operating activities and for the purchase of property  plant  equipment and engineering services in the amount of  for the fiscal years ended may   and  these cash expenditures totaled   and  respectively 
the fiscal increase in cash utilization is due primarily to lower interest income  expenses related to our annual meeting of stockholders  professional services for investor relations and expense associated with our directors and officers liability insurance 
we have financed our research and development and other activities to date through the public and private sale of equity securities and  to a more limited extent  through the license of product rights 
as of may   we had cash and marketable securities totaling  in july  we sold  shares of our common stock in an offering transaction that generated gross proceeds before expenses of  net proceeds from this offering were approximately million 
we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our operating capital requirements and maintain our existing manufacturing plant and office facilities through march  in addition  our existing capital resources are expected to be sufficient to support expenditures incurred in connection with our planned phase iii clinical trials during this period 
thereafter  we will require substantial additional funding to continue our operations and complete our planned clinical trials 
we may issue additional equity or debt securities or enter into collaborative arrangements with strategic partners  which could provide us with additional funding or absorb expenses we would otherwise be required to pay 
we are also pursuing potential sources of government funding 
any one or a combination of these sources may be utilized to raise additional capital 
we believe our ability to raise additional capital or enter into a collaborative arrangement with a strategic partner will depend primarily on the results of our planned clinical trials as well as general conditions in the business and financial markets 
our inability to raise sufficient levels of capital could materially delay or prevent the commercialization of polyheme  even if it is approved by fda 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to achieve product revenues or profitability on a sustained basis or at all 
as a result  our independent accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion based on uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
our capital requirements may vary materially from those now anticipated because of the timing and results of our clinical testing of polyheme  the establishment of relationships with strategic partners  changes in the scale  timing or cost of our commercial manufacturing facility  competitive and technological advances  the fda regulatory process  changes in our marketing and distribution strategy and other factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we believe the following critical accounting policy reflects our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
net deferred tax assets valuation we record our net deferred tax assets in the amount that we expect to realize based on projected future taxable income 
in assessing the appropriateness of our valuation  assumptions and estimates are required  such as northfield s ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event we were to determine that it was more likely than not we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their carrying value  an adjustment to recognize the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of may   we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of may  less than contractual cash obligations total one year years years lease obligations    other obligations    total contractual cash obligations    the lease for our evanston headquarters is cancelable with six months notice combined with a termination payment equal to six months base rent 
at may   this penalty would have amounted to  recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and for the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the enterprise also is to record a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long lived assets ie  the associated asset retirement costs and to depreciate that cost over the life of the assets 
the liability is changed at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the initial fair value measurement 
adoption of sfas is required for fiscal years beginning after june  upon adoption of this statement we expect to record an additional liability of approximately  as the additional costs required to restore our leased manufacturing facility back to its move in condition 
in december  the fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement amends sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
the provisions of sfas related to transition from the intrinsic value to the fair value method and annual disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the provisions of the statement related to interim disclosures are effective in financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the annual disclosures are included in the notes to these financial statements 
on may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the provisions of the statement will change the classification of certain freestanding financial instruments that are now classified as equity 
generally  the statement is effective for financial instrument arrangements entered into or modified after may  as of may   the adoption of sfas does not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas subsequent to may  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company currently does not have any foreign currency exchange risk 
the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of the company s short term investments  it believes that the financial market risk exposure is not material 
a one percentage point decrease on an investable balance of million would decrease interest income by
