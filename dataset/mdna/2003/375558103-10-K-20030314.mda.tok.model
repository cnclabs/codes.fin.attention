item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview gilead was incorporated in delaware on june  we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of antivirals  antibacterials and antifungals to treat life threatening infectious diseases 
we are a multinational company  with revenues from six approved products and marketing operations in ten countries 
currently  we market viread tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of hiv infection  hepsera adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b infection  ambisome amphotericin b liposome for injection  an antifungal agent  daunoxome daunorubicin citrate liposome injection  a drug approved for the treatment of kaposi s sarcoma  and vistide cidofovir injection for the treatment of cmv retinitis 
roche markets tamiflu oseltamivir phosphate for the treatment of influenza  under a collaborative agreement with us 
we are seeking to add to our existing portfolio of products through our clinical development programs  internal discovery programs and an active product acquisition and in licensing strategy  such as our acquisition of triangle completed in january our internal discovery activities include identification of new molecular targets  target screening and medicinal chemistry 
in addition  we are currently developing products to treat hiv and hbv infections 
we also have expertise in liposomal drug delivery technology that we use to develop drugs that are safer  easier for patients to tolerate and more effective 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi pharmaceuticals  inc in a transaction valued at up to million in cash and osi stock 
this transaction will allow us to focus on and continue to strengthen our core expertise in infectious diseases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted statement of financial accounting standards nos 
and  collectively referred to as sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  also resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
gilead s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as under the caption business  including risk factors that affect gilead in part i 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information currently available to gilead  do not include the effect of the acquisition of triangle in our guidance  unless specifically noted  since we are still evaluating the detailed financial impact of triangle s operations on our consolidated financial statements  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
viread sales 
we rely on sales of viread for a significant portion of our operating income 
a number of drugs to treat hiv infection and aids are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development  including products currently sold in the us among the companies that are significant competitors in the hiv aids market are gsk  bms  roche  pfizer  merck  boehringer ingelheim and abbott laboratories 
given the broad range of competitors and depth of their resources  viread s market penetration may be limited  particularly for use in treatment na ve patients  given that the data supporting viread s us approval is in a treatment experienced patient population 
ambisome sales 
we also rely on sales of ambisome for a significant portion of our operating income 
there are lower priced products that compete with ambisome  two products that compete with ambisome that were recently approved in the us and european union  and products being developed that could compete with ambisome in the future 
if any of these antifungal products achieve further market acceptance  or if the antifungal products in development become commercially available  revenues from sales of ambisome would likely decrease  resulting in a reduction of operating income 
acquisition integration 
in january  we completed the acquisition of triangle 
any acquisition carries inherent risks 
we may not be able to successfully integrate triangle into our operations and obtain any anticipated synergies or cost savings 
we may also be unsuccessful in obtaining marketing approval for emtricitabine or in developing a co formulated product 
failure to successfully integrate the triangle operations into our business or obtain marketing approval of emtricitabine could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
market acceptance of products 
the ability of our products to achieve and sustain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors  including the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals  the availability of public and private insurance and reimbursement for our products  the safety  efficacy  tolerability and cost of our products  ease of administration and dosing  and how our products compare to competitive products 
if our products do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  our results of operations will suffer 
regulatory process 
the us food and drug administration and foreign agencies could reject or limit the commercialization of our products for a number of reasons including if they disagree with the results or designs of our clinical trials  if they believe our products have unacceptable efficacy  toxicity or tolerability  or if they believe our products cannot be manufactured on a commercial basis in compliance with the applicable safety and quality standards 
if these agencies reject or limit the commercialization of our products  our financial results would be adversely affected 
the clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products are extremely expensive  and it is difficult for us to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter 
in addition  regulatory agencies could require us to conduct additional unanticipated clinical trials on our products  the cost of which could be substantial 
governmental legislation and reimbursement programs 
regulatory  legal and legislative issues may adversely affect pricing and sales of our products 
in the us  there is federal legislation that lowers the price for our products that are purchased or reimbursed by federal agencies  and some states have enacted legislation that can lower the prices for our products 
in addition  there are a growing number of us federal and state legislative proposals that if enacted would lower the price for our products 
many countries outside the us have government sponsored health care programs that set lower drug prices and patient reimbursement levels 
our sales in countries with relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those countries from lower price markets 
this is of particular concern in the european union where we are required to permit cross border sales and could be a concern in the us if legislation easing import restrictions is enacted and applied 
international credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to european product sales 
our european product sales to government owned or supported customers in greece  spain  portugal and italy are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
if significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable  our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
compulsory licensing and generic competition 
in a number of developing countries  government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for hiv infection available at a low cost 
in some cases  governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so  their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition 
some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for hiv drugs in certain developing countries 
if certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents  sales of viread in those countries could be reduced by generic competition 
alternatively  governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of viread in those countries  thereby reducing our viread sales  or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for viread 
in all of these situations  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
collaborations 
we depend on collaborations for the development and commercialization of certain products and for revenue  including the collaboration with fujisawa for sales of ambisome in the us and canada  the collaboration with gsk for clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of hepsera in asia  latin america and certain other territories  and the collaboration with roche for sales of tamiflu worldwide 
we may also seek additional collaborations 
these collaborations could fail for a number of reasons  including if our partners do not devote sufficient resources to the development  commercialization or marketing of our products  or if disputes arise with our partners 
if these existing collaborations fail  our financial results would be adversely affected 
foreign currency fluctuations 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
prior to january  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
we do hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which minimizes but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
uncertain financial results 
we expect that our financial results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
the fluctuations can be caused by many factors that are beyond our control  including the risk factors listed above 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates gilead s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  accrued clinical and preclinical expenses  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
gilead believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected returns of expired products  medicaid reimbursements and customer incentives  such as cash discounts for prompt payment 
estimates for medicaid reimbursements and cash discounts are based on contractual terms and expectations regarding the utilization rates for these programs 
estimates for product returns  including new products  are based on an on going analysis of industry and historical return patterns 
expected returns for our marketed drugs are generally low because the shelf life for these products ranges from months for viread up to months for ambisome in the us if conditions become more competitive for any of the markets served by our drugs or if other circumstances change  we may take actions to increase our product return estimates or we may offer additional customer incentives 
this would result in an incremental reduction of future revenue at the time the return estimate is changed or incentives are offered 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region  and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on the government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory based on quality control reviews of our individual raw material batches 
we generally do not maintain inventory reserves based on estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of the products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future demand and competition were to change and if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
we record accruals for estimated clinical and preclinical study costs 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
management accrues costs for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates that  generally  to of the work is for up front costs with the remaining activity occurring on a straight line basis over the life of the individual contract or study 
this estimate may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity to the extent possible  however  if management has underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we would have to record additional research and development expenses in future periods that could be significant 
results of operations revenues we had total revenue of million in  million in and million in included in total revenue are net product sales  royalty income and contract revenue  including revenue from research development r d and manufacturing collaborations 
net product sales revenue was million for  compared with million for and million for product sales increased in compared to primarily due to significant increases in sales of viread  which was approved for sale in the us in october and the european union in february a significant percentage of gilead s product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
prior to  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we began to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales which will reduce  but not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
losses on these revenue hedges reduced product revenues by million in sales of viread in were million in  or of total product sales  compared to million  or of total product sales in of the viread sales in  million were us sales and million were international sales 
with the continued market expansion of viread  we expect viread sales in to approximately double and be in the range of million to million 
sales of ambisome were million in  an increase of over ambisome sales of million in sales of ambisome were million in prior to  our revenues have been primarily derived from sales of ambisome  which represented of total product sales in  of total product sales in and of total product sales in excluding the impact of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  ambisome sales grew for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the increase in sales in compared to was primarily due to volume sales increases in europe  which offset declining sales in the us the increase in sales in compared to is primarily due to volume and price increases in the us and europe 
in addition  excluding the impact of the decline in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in  sales of ambisome in would have increased 
with the expected increase in competition  we expect ambisome sales for to be lower than and in the range of million to million 
we recorded royalty revenue of million in  compared with million in and million in during this three year period  the most significant source of royalty revenue was from sales of ambisome in the us by fujisawa under a co promotion arrangement with us 
royalty revenue from fujisawa was million in  compared with million in and million in we also recorded royalty revenue of million in  million in and million in related to sales of tamiflu 
tamiflu is an orally administered compound developed to treat and prevent viral influenza in humans 
gilead co developed tamiflu with roche  which owns the worldwide commercial rights to tamiflu  and is required to pay us a royalty on net sales of the product 
we began recognizing royalties from tamiflu in the first quarter of in june  roche received european regulatory approval of tamiflu for the treatment of influenza in adults and children and prevention in adolescents and adults 
as it is difficult to estimate third party product sales  we record royalty revenue one quarter in arrears 
total contract revenue was million in  compared with million in and million in in and a primary source of contract revenue was from our licensing of the selex process patent estate to archemix  which  due to collectibility concerns  we recognized on a cash basis 
this provided million of contract revenue in and million in in  roche made milestone payments of million for the european prophylaxis and treatment approvals of tamiflu  and in made a million milestone payment relating to the development of tamiflu under an r d collaboration agreement 
in  contract revenue from roche consisted of million in milestone payments related to roche completing regulatory filings and approvals for tamiflu in the us and japan 
as of december   gilead is entitled to additional milestone payments of up to million upon roche achieving certain developmental and regulatory milestones 
in april  gilead and gsk entered into a licensing agreement providing gsk the rights to commercialize hepsera  gilead s antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b  in asia  latin america and certain other territories 
under the agreement  gilead retained rights to hepsera in the us  canada  eastern and western europe  australia and new zealand 
gsk received exclusive rights to develop hepsera solely for the treatment of hepatitis b in all of its territories  the most significant of which include china  korea  japan and taiwan 
in addition  gsk paid gilead an up front licensing fee of million as the first payment against these additional obligations and  may pay up to million upon achievement by gsk of certain regulatory  development and commercial milestones 
of this million  million was received for the us approval of hepsera in september gsk also will pay gilead a royalty on net sales  if any  of hepsera in the gsk territories 
gsk will have full responsibility for development and commercialization of hepsera in gsk s territories 
the million up front fee and the million us approval fee have been recorded as deferred revenue in with a total of million being recognized as contract revenue in the balance of deferred revenue at december  will be amortized into contract revenue over the period of gilead s remaining obligations under the agreement  approximately years 
in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets to osi 
to date  we have received million in cash and million in osi stock 
under this agreement  we are entitled to additional payments from osi of up to million in either cash or a combination of cash and osi stock if and when osi reaches certain development milestones for nx  the most advanced of the oncology product candidates sold to osi 
under a related manufacturing agreement  we will produce nx and gs l  the two liposomal products included in the sale at our manufacturing facility in san dimas  california 
in  we recognized million of contract revenue under this manufacturing agreement 
in october  we entered into an agreement with archemix corporation relating to our selex technology 
under this agreement  we gave archemix the exclusive rights to the selex process  including therapeutic and other commercial applications to the extent not already licensed under pre existing agreements 
archemix paid to us million in and million in as required by our license agreement with ulehi  we paid of the million and million payments to ulehi 
we also received a warrant to purchase  shares of archemix common stock  the value of which is not material 
as required by our license agreement with ulehi  we transferred of this warrant to ulehi 
in march  we entered into an agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc relating to gilead s proprietary aptamer eye  currently known as macugen 
currently in early clinical trials  macugen is an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor  or vegf  which is known to play a role in the development of certain ophthalmic diseases 
under the terms of the agreement  eyetech received worldwide rights to all therapeutic uses of macugen  and  if the product is successfully commercialized  eyetech will pay us royalties on worldwide sales of the product 
eyetech also will be responsible for all research and development costs 
we provided clinical supplies of the product to eyetech through march we received a million up front licensing fee from eyetech in april  which has been recognized as revenue ratably over the one year supply agreement period 
accordingly  million of the license fee was recorded as contract revenue in  and million was recognized as revenue in we are also entitled to additional cash payments from eyetech of up to million if and when eyetech reaches certain macugen development milestones 
additionally  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share  the price at which the stock was issued to other investors 
gross margins product gross margins were in  compared with in and in the improvement from to is primarily driven by product mix as viread  a higher margin product  contributed significantly to net product sales in  whereas only modest sales of viread were recorded in foreign exchange also impacts gross margins as we price our products in the currency of the country into which the products are sold while a significant majority of our manufacturing costs are in us dollars 
for example  an increase in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar will positively impact gross margins since our manufacturing costs will remain approximately the same while our revenues after being translated into us dollars  will increase 
in  gross margins were positively impacted by the weakening us dollar while in and  gross margins were negatively impacted by these factors  as discussed in the product sales section under the caption revenues above 
except for the potential impact of unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in exchange rates relative to the us dollar and the mix of product sales between viread  hepsera and ambisome  we expect gross margins in to remain relatively stable compared to operating expenses in  r d expenses were of total costs and expenses 
in total  r d expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the major components of r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  clinical studies performed by contract research organizations  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are also separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology work 
clinical development costs include phase  and clinical trials as well as expanded access programs 
pharmaceutical development costs consist of product formulation and chemical analysis 
the following table breaks down these major components of research and development spending in thousands research    clinical development    pharmaceutical development    oncology divested   total    the million decrease in r d spending in compared to was primarily due to the reduction in expenses associated with the clinical program for viread  which was approved in october  and the elimination of expenses associated with our oncology program as a result of the sale of our oncology program to osi in december additionally  in we recognized as expense million of a million up front license fee paid to cubist pharmaceuticals related to the european licensing agreement for daptomycin  also known as cidecin  signed in january upon termination of this agreement in september  million was recorded to r d  which represented the remaining unamortized asset related to the preclinical oral formulation of daptomycin 
excluding the impact of the triangle acquisition  we expect r d expenses in to be approximately million to million  or approximately to higher than expenses 
the million increase in r d spending in versus was attributable in part to the recognition of million of the million up front payment and million of clinical milestone payments to cubist under the european licensing agreement for cidecin 
in addition  our expenses associated with the clinical programs for viread and hepsera increased by approximately million and million  respectively  during the year 
recent industry reports indicate that a biopharmaceutical company generally takes to years an average of years to research  develop and bring to market as a new prescription medicine in the us these averages are generally consistent with the projects that we develop internally  although our recent product development timelines have been on a more accelerated basis 
drug development in the us is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind  which  if successful  allows opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase   and  and generally accounts for an average of seven years of a drug s total development time 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have products in development that are in phase studies 
the successful development of our products is highly uncertain 
an estimation of completion dates and r d expenses can vary significantly for each product and are difficult to predict 
even after successful development and fda approval of a product  we undertake additional studies to try and expand the product s label and market potential 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of products  see the risk factors that affect gilead section of item i above 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in expenses in compared to is primarily due to our global sales and marketing efforts  including the expansion of gilead s us and european sales forces to support the commercial launches of viread and hepsera 
the increase in sg a expenses in versus was primarily due to gilead s increased global marketing efforts and the expansion of our sales force to support the commercial launch of viread 
in  we expect sg a expenses  excluding the impact of the triangle acquisition  to be approximately million to million  or to higher than levels  primarily due to the increase in marketing activities associated with the continued promotion of viread  hepsera and ambisome 
gain on sale of oncology assets in december  we completed the sale of our oncology assets  pipeline of clinical stage oncology products and related intellectual property  as well as our boulder  colorado operations  including clinical research and drug development personnel  infrastructure and facilities  to osi 
the pipeline of clinical candidates includes nx liposomal lurtotecan  gs a nucleoside analogue and gs l a liposomal thymidylate synthase inhibitor 
on the closing date  we received million in cash and osi common stock valued at approximately million 
we recorded a non operating gain of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of this transaction 
in addition  we recorded income taxes of million in connection with this transaction 
loss on sale of marketable securities in july  the company sold all of its remaining shares of osi common stock for approximately million 
these shares were partial consideration for the sale of our oncology assets to osi in december  at which time they were recorded at a fair market value of approximately million 
in connection with the sale of these remaining shares  we recognized a non operating loss of approximately million in the year ended december  gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate in august  we also sold our percent interest in proligo llc proligo to degussa corporation for million in cash 
proligo was a joint venture between gilead and skw americas  inc focused on the manufacturing of oligonucleotides 
skw americas  a subsidiary of degussa corporation  held the remaining percent of proligo 
the proceeds  net of gilead s investment in proligo  are reflected as an million gain on the sale of unconsolidated affiliate in interest income and interest expense we recorded interest income of million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in compared to is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates  partially offset by a higher average cash balance due to positive cash flow from operations and to the proceeds from the sale of the oncology assets to osi 
the increase in over was due to higher average balances of invested funds 
interest income in will depend principally upon prevailing interest rates  over which we have no control and the level of our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
we incurred interest expense of million in  compared with million in and million in the significant increase in over is due to the full year of interest on our million convertible subordinated notes 
interest expense for consisted primarily of interest on the million convertible notes  which were converted to common stock in august we expect interest expense in to increase as compared with expense levels primarily due to the issuance of the million convertible senior notes in december income taxes our provision for income taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this income tax expense was primarily associated with income earned by our foreign subsidiaries as we have significant net operating losses which reduce our us tax liability 
the significant increase in income tax expense in resulted principally from the gain on the sale of our oncology assets to osi  for which we recorded approximately million of federal and state alternative minimum taxes 
the provision for was reduced by a change in us income tax law 
this law allows net operating loss carryforward deductions to offset of alternative minimum taxable income  resulting in a reduction of us income tax recorded in the previous years of million 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 
we evaluate the realizibility of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of our unconsolidated affiliate  proligo  prior to the date of the sale of our percent interest 
in  we recorded million as our equity in the loss of proligo 
this represented our percent share of proligo s loss for the thirteen month period ended december  during the fourth quarter of  proligo changed its fiscal year end to december from november cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the year ended december   gilead adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
in the year ended december   gilead adopted the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  resulting in a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources during the fourth quarter of  a misclassification was discovered in the december  balance sheet and cash flow statement for the year then ended 
at december   million of osi stock received in consideration for the divestiture of our oncology assets was misclassified on the balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents instead of as marketable securities 
the misclassification had no impact on our statement of operations for any period  including revenues and net income 
the december  consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows in this report have been changed to reflect the correct classification 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december   up from million at december  the increase of million was primarily due to the million in net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible senior notes in december other major sources and uses of cash included net cash provided by operations of million and proceeds from issuances of stock under employee stock plans of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million and a million convertible note received from triangle 
the million loan to triangle was returned to us in connection with the now completed acquisition 
in january  approximately million has been paid to complete the acquisition of triangle 
working capital at december  was  million compared to million at december  significant changes in working capital during included a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory 
the accounts receivable increase was primarily due to increased sales of viread in the us and europe 
the million increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in the production of viread inventory to meet increasing sales demand 
significant changes in current liabilities during included an million increase in accrued liabilities  an million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses  a million increase in accrued compensation  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred revenue 
the million increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to medicaid rebate obligations associated with higher sales of viread 
the million decrease in accrued clinical and preclinical expenses is primarily due to decreasing activity associated with the clinical trial programs for viread and hepsera 
the million increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to increased bonus accruals and the expansion of our sales force 
the million increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increases in our raw material purchases in support of viread sales growth 
the million increase in deferred revenue primarily relates to the million received under the collaboration with gsk that we entered into in april the million effect of exchange rate changes on cash is primarily due to the weakening us dollar relative to the euro and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries accounts receivable balances  which are primarily denominated in the euro currency 
we made capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for facilities improvements to accommodate our growth  as well as for laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
capital expenditures related to research and development were between to of the million spent in and to of the million spent in we expect our capital spending for to be significantly higher than levels due to increased infrastructure needs and higher r d spending 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than gilead s common stock price at the notes issuance date 
the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after june   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets  and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  in a private offering 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to  shares of gilead common stock at per share 
the conversion price was higher than gilead s common stock price at the notes issuance date 
the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at our option  at any time on or after december   at specified redemption prices plus accrued interest 
debt issuance costs of million incurred in connection with the issuance of the notes were recorded as other noncurrent assets  and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the notes 
in august  we redeemed our convertible subordinated debentures at a cash price of  per  principal amount of debentures outstanding  plus accrued interest  which was the redemption price provided for in the original debenture indenture 
upon redemption  the entire million in principal amount of the debentures outstanding at that time was converted into  newly issued shares of gilead common stock by august  deferred debt issuance costs of million related to the debentures were charged to additional paid in capital in connection with the conversion of the debentures into common stock 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the commercial performance of viread  hepsera and ambisome  the commercial performance of any of our other products in development that receive marketing approval  including emtricitabine from our acquisition of triangle completed in january  the success of our partners research  development and commercialization efforts for the products they have partnered with us  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the rate of technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of our products under development  administrative expenses  the status of competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity or third party manufacturing arrangements  the expansion of sales and marketing capabilities  our possible geographic expansion  and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings or additional collaborative agreements with corporate partners 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure you that it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
subsidiaries and other we have established a variety of subsidiaries in various countries for the purpose of conducting business in those locations 
all of these subsidiaries are consolidated in our financial statements 
we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements  including those defined as variable interest entities by the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
we are also not involved in any non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for employee loans 
we have contractual obligations in the form of capital and operating leases  notes payable and clinical research organization contracts

arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the us as well as sales activities in europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our foreign currency sales transactions  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts receivable 
additionally  to mitigate the impact of currency rate fluctuations on our cash outflows for certain foreign currency denominated raw materials purchases  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
a significant percentage of our product sales is denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and in the future may reduce  our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
prior to  we did not hedge our exposure to the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on forecasted sales 
effective january  we have begun to use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  the contracts have maturities of one year or less with one exception 
one hedge contract intended to hedge raw materials purchases in the first quarter of  with a notional amount of million and an insignificant fair value at december  has a maturity of months 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value december  british pound  euro   the total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of million and fair value of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale investment securities and our fixed rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to the investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 
the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest bearing assets and fixed rate liabilities at december  dollars in thousands 
years ending december  fair value december  thereafter total assets available for sale securities    average interest rate liabilities long term obligations  including current portion   average interest rate convertible senior debentures  interest rate convertible subordinated debentures  interest rate long term obligations consist of capital leases  operating leases net of noncancelable subleases and debt secured by property  plant and equipment 
the interest portion of payments due is included 
international credit risk our accounts receivable balance at december  was million compared to million at december  the growth was primarily due to higher product sales for viread in the us and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  spain  portugal and italy  our accounts receivable balances are significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the financial risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  spain  portugal and italy totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
at december   past due receivables for these countries were million  of which approximately million was more than days past due 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that all accounts receivable balances as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  including those due from customers in these four countries  are collectible 
we continually seek to improve our collection processes to ensure that we fully collect amounts due to us based on our product sales and that collections are timely
