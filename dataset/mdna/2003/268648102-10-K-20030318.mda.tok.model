the global economic slowdown  which commenced in and continued throughout  led to a reduction in information technology spending 
competitive pricing pressures also had an adverse effect on revenues 
information storage software revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to the decrease in compared to was primarily due to declining sales volume caused 
table of contents by the global economic slowdown and increased levels of competition 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to greater demand for storage software on both newly shipped and already installed systems and the successful introduction of new and enhanced software products 
continued negative trends in the economy  further reductions in information technology spending  increased levels of competition or continued pricing pressures may continue to negatively impact information storage systems and software revenues in information storage services revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to  and  or  from to the increases were primarily due to a greater volume of professional services  largely to support and implement automated networked storage solutions 
additionally  the increases were due to a growth in maintenance revenues associated with a greater number of both software and hardware maintenance contracts 
total information storage revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to  and  or  from to other businesses revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to  and  or  from to other businesses revenues consist of revenues from aviion server products and related services 
included in the and amounts were revenues from aviion server products of and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  emc stopped selling aviion server products 
accordingly  other businesses revenues for the last quarter of  all of and future years are and will be comprised only of aviion services revenues 
these revenues are expected to continue to decline in future years 
revenues on sales into the north american markets were   and  in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to  and  or  from to revenues on sales into the european  middle east and african markets were   and  in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to  and  or  from to revenues on sales into the asia pacific markets were  and in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to revenues on sales into the latin american markets were  and in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or  from to  and an increase of  or  from to the decline in revenues in all markets in and in the north american and european  middle east and african markets in was attributable to the global economic slowdown that began in and continued throughout  which led to a reduction in information technology spending 
increased levels of competition  including competitive pricing pressures  also had an adverse effect on revenues 
the decline in the latin american markets in was further impacted by the region s political and currency instability 
the increase in revenues in compared to in the asia pacific and the latin american markets resulted from our efforts to expand our sales infrastructure throughout these regions to meet demand for information storage products and services 
while revenues increased in these markets  the increases were lower than anticipated due to the aforementioned factors causing the decline in revenues in the other regions 
the provision for sales returns was in  in and in at the time of sale  we provide for the potential returns of systems as a reduction of revenue 
we estimate the amount of returns based upon our historical experience  specific identification of probable returns and current market and economic conditions 
the decrease in the provision for sales returns in compared to was attributable to a decline in revenue and a reduction in the level of returns experienced in compared to the increase in the provision for sales returns in compared to was attributable to an increase in the level of returns experienced in over in  various segments of our customer base to which we sell both directly and indirectly  including telecommunication providers and internet related businesses  experienced dramatic declines 
table of contents in their respective businesses 
as a consequence  we had a higher level of returns in compared to we therefore increased our provision for sales returns during as the economy and our customers businesses continued to deteriorate 
changes in exchange rates in compared to had a negligible effect on revenues 
changes in exchange rates in compared to negatively impacted revenues by approximately 
the impact was most significant in japan  brazil and germany

 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
the declines in gross margin dollars in both and were primarily in the information storage products segment 
gross margin percentages for information storage products were  and in  and  respectively 
the gross margin percentage for was negatively impacted by  or  for a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and impaired capitalized software 
the gross margin percentage for was favorably impacted by  or  resulting from a partial reduction of the provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
the benefit resulted primarily from the sale of previously identified obsolete inventory for which a full reserve had been established 
the annual declines in gross margin percentages in and were primarily attributable to the reduction in revenues resulting from lower sales volume  which caused fixed overhead costs to be absorbed over a lower sales base 
in addition  lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing also contributed to the declines 
partially offsetting the declines were reductions in our fixed overhead costs resulting from measures we took to reduce costs  which were initiated in the second half of additionally  the gross margin percentage was favorably impacted as a result of implementing fas no 
the gross margin percentage for information storage services increased to in compared to in and in the increases in the gross margin percentages were attributable to greater productivity of our customer service and professional services personnel 
gross margin percentages for other businesses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the gross margin percentage in resulted from this segment consisting only of services revenue in compared to both systems and services revenue in the decline in the gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily caused by the discontinuance of the sale of aviion server products in the third quarter of we anticipate that the overall gross margin percentage will improve in compared to as our volume of information storage systems and software sales increases 
however  if sales volumes do not increase or competitive pricing pressures increase from those we experienced in  gross margins may be negatively impacted in research and development research and development r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
r d expenses decreased in compared to  and increased in compared to as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
in addition  we spent  and in  and  respectively  on software development  which costs were capitalized 
r d spending levels reflect our efforts to continue to improve our long term competitive position  offset in part by our continued cost cutting 
r d spending includes enhancements to information storage software and information storage systems  including networked information storage systems 
we will continue with our r d efforts in  however  the overall level of spending is 
table of contents expected to be slightly lower in compared to as we gain further efficiencies in our operating cost structure 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
sg a expenses decreased in compared to and increased in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in sg a in compared to was due to measures we took to reduce costs  which were initiated in the second half of and continued in  enabling us to begin to achieve a cost structure commensurate with reduced revenue levels 
additionally  lower commission expense due to lower revenues reduced sg a expenses 
the increase in spending in compared to was primarily due to efforts to expand sales and build an infrastructure to support an expected increased revenue base  partially offset by reductions implemented in the second half of to achieve a lower cost structure 
the provision for bad debts was in  in and in we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts and notes receivable that will not be collected 
the allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  the age of our receivables and current market and economic conditions 
the increases in the provision in compared to and compared to were each due to the general economic declines experienced worldwide 
restructuring and other special charges due to the declines in revenues experienced in and  in each of those years  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on the highest potential growth areas of our business 
in and  we recognized restructuring and other special charges of and  respectively 
the charges consisted of associated with the restructuring program  an loss on assets disposed of within the fourth quarter of associated with the restructuring program and of additional restructuring costs associated with the restructuring program 
offsetting these costs in was a reduction in the third quarter provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
the charge consisted of a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  for restructuring activities and for other than temporary declines in equity investments 
the restructuring and other special charges have been classified within our statement of operations according to their related category 
these categories are as follows restructuring charge cost of sales restructuring and other special charges sg a expenses other expense  net total the detail on each of the charges and activity for and is explained in the following sections 
restructuring program in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring program to further reduce our cost structure 
as a result of the program  we incurred restructuring and other special charges of the restructuring charges consisted of for employee termination benefits  to consolidate excess facilities  related to the impairment of long lived assets and for contractual and other obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit 
the restructuring program impacted all of our segments 

table of contents worldwide reduction in force the restructuring program includes a reduction in force of approximately  employees across all business functions and geographic regions 
approximately of such employees are or were based in north america and the remainder are or were based in europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
the workforce reduction resulted in a pre tax charge of for termination benefits 
as a result of labor laws in certain foreign countries in which we operate  the amount of termination benefits for employees in such countries was not determinable as of december  as these amounts are finalized  which is expected to be in the first quarter of  we will recognize additional charges 
as of december   approximately  employees had been terminated 
consolidation of excess facilities the restructuring program includes a pre tax charge of for the consolidation of space within our corporate facilities and the elimination of excess field office space worldwide 
included in the charge are for estimated losses on subleases and a impairment charge for non recoverable leasehold improvements 
certain facilities were vacated in the fourth quarter of  with the remainder to be vacated in the first half of as a result of our decision to vacate the premises earlier than the lease termination dates  we will accelerate the amortization of the related leasehold improvements over the remaining periods of occupancy 
this will result in incremental amortization expense of in the first half of impairment of long lived assets in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a program to consolidate the locations of and made other modifications to our internet hosting business 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax charge of relating to the impairment of long lived assets 
the impairment charge is equal to the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeded the present value of their estimated discounted cash flows 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we placed for sale certain assets associated with a portion of our data general services business 
the expected proceeds from this sale were estimated to be less than the related assets carrying value  resulting in a pre tax charge of the impaired assets are classified within our information storage services segment 
contractual and other obligations as a result of the restructuring program  various contractual obligations will no longer provide any economic benefit to us 
these contractual obligations include marketing agreements  equipment leases  maintenance agreements and component part purchase obligations 
additionally  as a result of our restructuring activities  we have certain pending employment related claims 
in light of the above factors  we recognized a pre tax charge of a summary of the costs for the restructuring program is outlined as follows category provision current utilization ending balance non cash portion of the provision workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities asset impairment contractual and other obligations total loss on the disposal of assets as a result of the restructuring program  we disposed of certain fixed assets that were no longer essential to the operation of our business 
as a result  we recognized a pre tax charge of which is classified within other expense  net  in our statement of operations 

table of contents impacts of the restructuring program the restructuring program is expected to be substantially completed by june   although the ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions 
the expected cash impact of the restructuring program is  of which was paid in remaining cash expenditures  relating to workforce reductions and contractual obligations  are expected to be substantially paid by the end of amounts relating to the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through as a result of the restructuring program  we expect to reduce costs in all areas of our operations  favorably impacting cost of sales  sg a expenses and r d expenses 
the restructuring program  once fully implemented  is expected to reduce costs by approximately per year 
we began to realize a portion of the benefits in the fourth quarter of restructuring program in the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce our cost structure 
as a result of the program  we incurred restructuring and other special charges of the restructuring charges consisted of for employee termination benefits  related to the impairment of goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets  to consolidate excess facilities and for other contractual obligations for which we will no longer derive an economic benefit 
the other special charges included a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of and an other than temporary decline in certain equity investments of the amounts charged and adjusted against the provisions established in are as follows category beginning balance adjustment to the provision current utilization ending balance workforce reduction other contractual obligations consolidation of excess facilities total category beginning balance provision adjustment to the provision current utilization ending balance workforce reduction impairment of goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets other contractual obligations consolidation of excess facilities total the restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately  employees across all business functions and geographic regions

the adjustment to the provision for workforce reduction in was primarily attributable to the finalization of severance payments associated with reductions in force in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in resulted from favorable settlements 
the adjustment to the provision for the workforce reduction in primarily related to voluntary employee resignations 
the adjustment to the provision for other contractual obligations in related primarily to a favorable settlement of an estimated liability for the closure of an information storage services business 
the adjustment to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in primarily related to additional leased facilities being vacated 

table of contents inventory provision the amounts charged and adjusted against the established provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are set forth below

these investments are in privately held companies  primarily in the storage industry  many of which are in the start up or development stage 
these investments are carried at cost  subject to adjustment for impairment 
due to the continued global economic slowdown in  as well as the downturn in the storage industry  we determined that the decline in these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss 
impacts of the restructuring program the restructuring program has been substantially completed  although our ability to sell and sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions 
the expected cash impact of the charge is  of which was paid in and was paid in the remaining accrual balance primarily relates to the consolidation of facilities that will be paid over the respective lease terms through cost savings from the restructuring programs both the and restructuring programs have reduced costs in all areas of our operations  favorably impacting cost of sales  sg a expenses and r d expenses 
as of december   the annualized costs savings  compared to the cost structure in place as of the end of the second quarter of  is in excess of  investment income and interest expense investment income was  and in  and  respectively 
investment income was earned primarily from investments in cash equivalents  short and long term investments and sales 
table of contents type leases

these investments were carried at cost  subject to impairment 
due to the continued global economic slowdown in  as well as the downturn in the storage industry  we determined that the decline in value of these investments was other than temporary and recognized an impairment loss 
provision for income taxes in and  we reported pre tax losses resulting in income tax benefits of and  respectively 
in  we reported pre tax income resulting in a provision for income taxes of the rates of benefit were in compared to in in  the effective income tax rate was 
the effective income tax rate is based upon the income loss for the year  the composition of the income loss in different countries  and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences  benefits or resolutions of tax audits 
for  the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily as a result of the overall favorable resolution of international tax matters  which aggregated such amount included the favorable resolution of an international tax audit  partially offset by a provision for tax liabilities on other international tax matters 
additionally  a reduction in the valuation allowance resulting from the realization of capital loss carryforwards contributed to the favorable rate 
for  the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to the mix of income and losses in foreign countries and the establishment of provisions associated with the impact of foreign tax audits  partially offset by a tax benefit realized from a prior acquisition 
for  the effective income tax rate varied from the statutory rate due to our global tax strategy and the effect of our european manufacturing operations 
the valuation allowance decreased by in and in the valuation allowance increased by in the decreases in the valuation allowance in and were attributable to the realization of capital loss carryforwards 
additionally  we liquidated certain foreign subsidiaries  resulting in the loss of their net operating loss carryforwards that had been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
as a result of the liquidations  both the deferred tax assets associated with the operating loss carryforwards and the related valuation allowance were reversed 
partially offsetting these decreases in the valuation allowance were increases resulting from the generation of additional foreign loss carryforwards 
we expect the effective income tax rate for to be approximately  however  the rate may vary depending upon the actual operating results for the year  the composition of the income loss in different countries and adjustments  if any  for the potential tax consequences  benefits or resolutions of tax audits 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments were  and  at december  and  respectively  an increase of in  cash and cash equivalents decreased by and short and long term investments increased by  cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in and  in the decline in compared to was primarily attributable to a lower level of cash generated from 
table of contents working capital in compared to the reduction in working capital was primarily driven by a reduction in cash generated from collecting accounts and notes receivable due to lower revenue levels in compared to partially offsetting this reduction were increases in deferred revenue attributable to increased sales of software maintenance contracts 
the decline in compared to was primarily attributable to the loss incurred in the year 
offsetting the loss was an overall improvement in cash generated from working capital associated with substantial reductions in accounts and notes receivable and inventories 
cash used for investing activities was   and  in  and  respectively 
capital additions were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in capital additions in compared to resulted from measures we took to reduce costs  which were initiated in the second half of capitalized software development costs were  and in  and  respectively 
net purchases and maturities of investments  consisting of debt securities  were  and in  and  respectively 
we expect our capital additions for to be approximately the same to slightly down compared with the spent in cash used for financing activities was in compared to cash provided by financing activities of and in and  respectively 
in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock  par value 
per share common stock  at a cost of as of december   we had repurchased million shares of the million shares of common stock authorized for repurchase by our board of directors 
from time to time  we enter into rule b plans to facilitate our share repurchases 
in  we generated from the issuance of common stock in the initial public offering of mcdata corporation mcdata 
in  we distributed our ownership interest in mcdata 
as a result of the distribution  mcdata s net assets are no longer consolidated with our assets  which resulted in a reduction in cash 
the majority of the remaining cash generated in  and was from the exercise of stock options 
in  of convertible debt was converted into our common stock 
we have available for use credit lines of in the united states and in brazil 
the brazilian line of credit has been established to help manage currency volatility between the local currency and the us dollar 
the brazilian line requires us to borrow in brazilian currency 
as of december   we had outstanding on our line of credit in brazil and none outstanding on our line of credit in the united states 
the brazilian line of credit requires us to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses and maintaining minimum levels of cash and investments 
in the event the covenants are not met  the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
we lend certain fixed income securities to generate investment income 
during  we entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis 
under these securities lending agreements  the value of the collateral is equal to of the fair market value of the loaned securities 
the collateral is generally cash  us government backed securities or letters of credit 
at december   there were no outstanding securities lending transactions 
based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  we believe that the combination of funds currently available  funds generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations impacting our liquidity 
the following represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years capital leases operating leases other long term obligations  including notes payable and current portion of long term obligations purchase orders total our operating leases are primarily for office space around the world 
we believe leasing such space is more cost effective than purchasing real estate 
the other long term obligations  including notes payable and the current portion of long term obligations  consist primarily of of obligations associated with the data general pension and post retirement medical and life insurance plans 
the purchase orders are for manufacturing and non manufacturing related goods and services 
while the purchase orders are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for percentage based cancellation fees or minimum restocking charges based on the nature of the product or service 
off balance sheet arrangements  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations emc s subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions to provide guarantees for rent  taxes  insurance  leases  performance bonds  bid bonds and customs duties aggregating as of december  the guarantees vary in length of time 
in connection with these arrangements  we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions 
we have also agreed to guarantee our brazilian subsidiary s line of credit 
we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  resellers  oems  systems integrators and distributors 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an emc product infringes a patent or copyright 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury or acts or omissions of emc  its employees  agents or representatives

in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors  officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition 
in a substantial majority of instances  we have maintained the acquired company s directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in connection with certain dispositions  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters  such as breaches of representations and warranties 
these indemnities vary in length of time 
based upon our historical experience and information known as of december   we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at december  is immaterial 
notes and accounts receivable we derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems 
we customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes 
from time to time  we may also sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial 
litigation in april  emc filed a complaint against hitachi with the itc and in the united states federal district court in worcester  massachusetts 
the itc complaint alleged that hitachi had engaged in unlawful activities by importing into the united states products that infringed six emc patents 
we asked the itc to issue an injunction to block importation of hitachi s infringing products and in may  the itc voted to commence an investigation into our claims 
the suit in district court seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement 
in june  the suit in district court was stayed  pending the outcome of the itc action 
subsequent to the date we filed a complaint against hitachi  in april  hitachi and hicam filed a complaint against us in the united states federal district court for the western district of oklahoma alleging that certain of our products infringe eight hitachi patents and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement 
in july  this suit was transferred to the united states federal district court in worcester  massachusetts

we are a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business 
management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents pension and post retirement medical and life insurance plans emc has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the data general acquisition  which covers substantially all former data general employees located in the united states 
certain of the former data general foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees 
substantially all of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services 
the assets for these defined benefit plans are invested primarily in common stock  bonds and cash equivalent securities 
the market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value 
the expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended december  was 
this rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for all defined benefit plans international and us weighted by the plans assets as of december  the actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended december  was 
in order to reflect current capital market projections  the expected long term rate of return for the plans expense has been reduced to 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately an impact on the pension expense 
as of december   the pension plans had a unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
at december   the discount rate was 
this rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans international and us weighted by plan liabilities as of december  the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
for the us plan  this rate is based on moody s aa corporate bond index

a basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a impact on the pension expense for all plans international and us emc also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the data general acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former data general employees 
the plan s assets are invested primarily in common stock  bonds and cash equivalent securities 
the market related value of the plan s assets is equal to the assets fair value

at december   the discount rate was 
the discount rate is based on moody s aa corporate bond index 
a basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense 
as a result of the changes in the expected long term rates of return and discount rate  our pension and post retirement medical and life insurance obligation increased from at december  to at december  in january  we funded an additional into the us pension plan 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
emc s significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles  including the sec s staff accounting bulletin  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  statement of position no 
 software 
table of contents revenue recognition  fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  fas no 
 accounting for leases  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  among others 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems  software and services or a combination of these items 
as our business evolves  the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized 
additionally  revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
warranty costs we accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts and notes receivable  inventories and intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
restructuring charges we have recognized restructuring charges in and the restructuring charges include  among other items  estimated losses on the sale of real estate  subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts 
the amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors  including market conditions and negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for 
table of contents recognizing  measuring and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities 
the pronouncement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
under eitf  a liability is recognized solely upon an entity s commitment to a plan 
fas no 
adjusts the timing of when a liability for termination benefits is to be recognized based upon whether the employee is required to render future service 
a liability for costs to terminate an operating lease or other contract before the end of its term is to be recognized when the entity terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract 
all other costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are to be expensed as incurred 
fas no 
requires the liability to be measured at its fair value with subsequent changes in fair value to be recognized each reporting period utilizing an interest allocation approach 
the pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
we adopted fas no 
effective january   and we do not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses revenue recognition on arrangements encompassing multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time  defining criteria that must be met for elements to be considered to be a separate unit of accounting 
if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is recognized at the time of delivery 
we do not expect that the pronouncement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we do not expect that this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas no 
amends fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of fas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as provided for in fas no 
 we have elected to apply accounting principles board apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
apb no 
does not require options to be expensed when granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value 
we intend to continue to apply the provisions of apb no 
see note a to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies accounting for stock based compensation 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
variable interest entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we do not expect that this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risks 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
our future results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
our operating results have been materially adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic conditions and reduced information technology spending 
if economic and market conditions do not improve  our business  results of operations or financial condition could continue to be materially adversely affected 
our business could continue to be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for information storage systems  software and services  particularly in the product segments in which we compete 
during and  we experienced a decrease in demand for information storage products as customers delayed or reduced their information technology expenditures 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending  domestically or internationally  could continue to materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings 
we may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry  technological and market changes 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers 
there can be no assurance that our existing products will continue to be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis  or at all 
we spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time 
there can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products or new products will receive customer acceptance 
as competition in the storage industry increases  it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits 
risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage  networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products 
risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately  the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products  the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced  thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive obsolete supply of inventory  and delays in initial shipments of new products 
further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for longer periods of time 
our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis  keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the markets we serve are highly competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
we compete with many established companies in the markets we serve and some of these companies whether independently or by establishing alliances may have substantially greater financial  marketing and 
table of contents technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various information technology requirements than us 
we also compete with many smaller  less established companies who may be able to focus more effectively on specific product segments or markets 
historically  we have competed primarily on the basis of our products features and performance 
as product pricing becomes a more important criteria for our customers  we may experience increased competition from certain low price competitors 
companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us 
our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products  including hardware and software products  and services by our competitors  and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors 
in addition  as we increase our software and services businesses  we may face new competitive challenges 
we may have difficulty managing operations 
in october  we announced a restructuring program to further reduce our cost structure 
the restructuring program included a reduction in force of approximately  employees and the closure of certain facilities 
our future operating results will depend on the success of this restructuring program as well as on our overall ability to manage operations  which includes  among other things managing our business with fewer employees retaining and hiring  as required  the appropriate number of qualified employees enhancing  as appropriate  our infrastructure  including but not limited to  our information systems accurately forecasting revenues transitioning our sales force to sell more software and services managing inventory levels  including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory  while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity  real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans an unexpected further decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a further material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
competitive pricing and difficulty managing product costs could materially adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the information storage market and have had  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide information storage products or services  together with other products or services  at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 
we currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
to date  we have been able to manage our component and product design costs 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs 
further  the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and component cost could have a material adverse effect on our earnings 

table of contents if our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements  we could have decreased revenues and earnings 
we purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers  including some of our competitors 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components  power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties 
we have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements 
if any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders  be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis  if at all  and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies  along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that a supplier who fails to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers  partners  suppliers and distributors and resellers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of components and distribution of products 
our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel 
our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees  the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings 
our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
we believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including the significant size of our average product price in relation to our customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders  there will be excess 
table of contents inventory 
alternatively  if orders substantially exceed predicted demand  the ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited  which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty moreover  delays in product shipping  caused by loss of power or telecommunications or similar services  or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses  could intensify the impact of these factors on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition to our direct sales force  we have agreements in place with many distributors  systems integrators  resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services 
we may  from time to time  derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated  if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken 
in addition  as our market opportunities change  we may have an increased reliance on channel partners  which may negatively impact our gross margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels 
if we are not successful  we may lose sales opportunities  customers and market share 
furthermore  the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop or market products or services in competition with us in the future 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business including  among other things the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the difficulty of integrating the acquired business the lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired business the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential impairment of acquired assets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
to the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase common stock in 
table of contents connection with any future acquisition  existing stockholders may experience dilution and potentially decreased earnings per share 
we also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business 
changes in foreign conditions could impair our international sales 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products by us or our suppliers were to occur  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair  replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing or technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 

table of contents from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
from time to time  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us 
our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community in addition  our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions 
if such conditions continue to deteriorate  our stock price could decline further 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
additionally  we have exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia 
despite the relatively small size of our exposure in these markets  the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact our financial results 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
we employ a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive 
table of contents income loss 
these instruments are not leveraged  and are not held for trading purposes 
a portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk

the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable 
we place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment in any one issuer 
the credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is minimal due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas 
we customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes
