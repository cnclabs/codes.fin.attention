item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at december   humboldt had total consolidated assets of billion  total net loans of million  total deposits of million and stockholders equity of million 
for the year ended december   humboldt reported net income of million  or per diluted share  and net income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share 
the loss on discontinued operations of  after tax  or per diluted share  resulted from the final wind down of humboldt s leasing subsidiary  discussed in detail below under the heading discontinued operations and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
all outstanding and weighted average share amounts presented in this report have been restated to reflect the six for five stock split in  the stock dividends in  and  and a five for two stock split in factors that may affect future results of operations the sale of our proprietary merchant bankcard operation will reduce net income in the short term and strategic initiatives to replace the lost income may be inadequate the sale of the proprietary merchant bankcard business  which was completed on march   will result in a decrease in net income of approximately million annually on a pre tax basis 
humboldt has identified several key initiatives  including residential mortgage lending and new service charge structures that are expected to provide for a replacement of the lost revenue over a period of to months 
there is no assurance that these initiatives will  individually or collectively  provide for the replacement of the lost revenue within the expected time horizon 
we may be unable to deploy the excess capital resulting from the sale of the proprietary merchant bankcard business in a timely manner in order to offset the reduction in earnings per share resulting from the sale of the proprietary merchant bankcard business  humboldt s board of directors approved a million share repurchase program 
there is no guarantee that sufficient shares will be available for repurchase at price levels that are acceptable or that humboldt will be able obtain an adequate return on excess capital through other initiatives related to community banking 
the decision to exit the iso sponsorship business will adversely impact the bank s liquidity and net income if core deposit growth is insufficient in connection with the decision to sell the proprietary merchant bankcard business  humboldt also decided to cease its sponsorship processing for merchant bankcard isos as its remaining agreements expire 
the principal benefit derived from the iso sponsorship business is the use of impounded deposits held as reserves for merchant losses 
as of december   the bank held approximately million of iso deposits 
as the iso agreements expire between april and march  the bank will lose the related deposits and  in the short term  need to replace them with wholesale funding to the extent that core deposit growth is not sufficient to cover the outflow 
although current market rates for wholesale borrowings are at historic lows  the cost of replacing the merchant deposits will result in increased interest expense 
potential deterioration of local economic conditions could hurt our profitability the bank s operations are located in california  and substantially all of the outstanding loans and commitments are to businesses and individuals located in northern california 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the bank s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
adverse local economic conditions in california  and  in particular  northern california  may have a greater adverse effect on our financial condition through reduced growth prospects and potentially higher credit losses than if the bank s operations were more geographically diverse 

table of contents plans to convert to a new core bank processing system will increase operating expenses and may strain human resources and possibly result in service disruptions in november  the bank entered into an agreement with information technology  inc for the purchase of hardware and software that will replace the bank s current core processing system  to upgrade the bank s computer network architecture and to install new equipment for imaging and processing checks 
the total cost of this upgrade is approximately million  which will be amortized over useful lives of between three and five years 
the conversion is expected to be completed by july although significant preparation and planning are being conducted  including the engagement of experienced consultants and the performance of mock conversions  the possibility exists that the conversion will not go as planned 
this could result in degraded customer service levels 
a significant or prolonged disruption in service levels resulting from core processing conversion problems could result in the loss of customers and have an adverse impact on the bank s results of operations and liquidity 
our effective tax rate may increase if the california tax code is changed in december  the bank formed a real estate investment trust reit subsidiary  hb investment trust hbit 
the bank owns of the voting stock of hbit and is the sole contributor of assets  which consist entirely of real estate secured loans originated and serviced by the bank 
although hbit was formed to provide flexibility in raising capital through the issuance of preferred stock  no issuance of preferred stock was made as of december  for the purposes of raising capital 
the bank also benefits from a reduction in state income tax expense  since any consent dividends paid by hbit to the bank are not subject to state income tax 
for  this resulted in a tax expense reduction of approximately million 
in the event the california state tax code is amended to eliminate the exemption for consent dividends paid by a reit  the bank would have a higher effective tax rate and increased state tax expense 
changes in the method of accounting for stock options will reduce our net income and earnings per share in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  an amendment of sfas no 
in an effort to encourage the recognition of compensation expense for the issuance of stock options 
humboldt adopted sfas no 
effective january  using the prospective application method 
under this method  the compensation expense and related tax benefit associated with stock option grants issued on or after january  will be recognized in the income statement 
the unvested portion of stock option grants issued before january  will continue to be accounted for under apb no 
sfas no 
also requires new pro forma disclosures regarding the cost of stock options not accounted for under apb no 
the adoption of sfas no 
will reduce humboldt s net income and earnings per share 
the future amount of this reduction is dependent upon a number of factors  including the number of options granted and certain variables used in determining the fair value of each option granted under the black scholes model 
these variables include the volatility of humboldt s stock price  humboldt s dividend yield  market interest rates and the expected life of the options 
the actual compensation ultimately realized by option holders is determined at the time of exercise based on the differential between the option exercise price and the current market value of humboldt stock 
the historical cost of options granted  although not recognized in the income statement  is presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and is calculated in the same manner as if such expense were recognized in the income statement in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents the bank faces strong competition in recent years  competition for bank customers  the source of deposits and loans  has greatly intensified 
this competition includes large national and super regional banks  which have well established branches and significant market share in many of the communities we serve  finance companies  investment banking and brokerage firms  and insurance companies that offer bank like products  credit unions  which can offer highly competitive rates on loans and deposits because they receive tax advantages not available to commercial banks  government assisted farm credit programs that offer competitive agricultural loans  other community banks  including start up banks  which can compete with us for customers who desire a high degree of personal service  technology oriented financial institutions including large national and super regional banks offering on line deposit  bill payment  and mortgage loan application services 
other existing single or multi branch community banks  or new community bank start ups  have marketing strategies similar to humboldt s 
these other community banks can open new branches in the communities in which we serve and compete directly for customers who want the high level of service community banks offer 
other community banks also compete for the same management personnel and the same potential acquisition and merger candidates in northern california 
historically  insurance companies  brokerage firms  credit unions and other non bank competitors have less regulation than banks and can be more flexible in the products and services they offer 
under the financial services modernization act of  most separations between banks  brokerage firms and insurance companies were eliminated  which has increased competition 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec recently issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
humboldt s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management believes that the following policies could be considered critical within the sec s definition 
reserves and contingencies humboldt must manage and control certain inherent risks in the normal course of its business 
these include  credit risk  fraud risk  operations and settlement risk  and interest rate risk 
humboldt has established reserves for risk of losses  including loan losses  tax contingencies and merchant bankcard losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents humboldt s estimate of the probable losses that have occurred as of the date of the financial statements  as further described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that humboldt has appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
the allowance for merchant bankcard losses represents humboldt s estimate of probable losses that have occurred as of the date of the financial statements if humboldt prevails in a matter for which an accrual has been established or is required to pay an amount exceeding recorded reserves  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 

table of contents derivative financial instruments humboldt has a policy that provides for the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
this policy permits the use of interest rate swap  cap and floor contracts to hedge specific interest rate risk exposures as part of humboldt s asset liability management process 
this policy limits the notional amount of total derivative financial instruments to of total assets 
notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements contains additional information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments 
discontinued operations off balance sheet financing during the first quarter of  humboldt classified its leasing subsidiary  bfs  as a discontinued operation upon adoption of a plan to sell the subsidiary 
during the second quarter of  it was determined that a sale of bfs was unlikely and the plan was modified to wind down the operations of bfs 
management believes that the wind down of bfs meets the requirements for classification as a discontinued operation 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains additional information about discontinued operations 
prior to its classification as a discontinued operation  bfs formed three subsidiaries that were not consolidated on the financial statements of bfs or humboldt 
these subsidiaries are commonly referred to as special purpose entities  or spes 
as of december   only two subsidiaries were not consolidated 
both of the remaining unconsolidated subsidiaries are considered qualifying spes that were formed for the sole purpose of issuing lease backed notes to institutional investors 
additional information on these spes is provided in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition humboldt s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities and fees received in connection with providing merchant bankcard processing services 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains an explanation of the process for determining when the accrual of interest income is discontinued on impaired loans and under what circumstances loans are returned to an accruing status 
merchant bankcard revenue is recorded on a cash basis 
an additional source of revenue for humboldt is related to the gains recorded in connection with the sale of the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans for which humboldt retains the right to service the loans 
recording of such gains involves the use of estimates and assumptions related to the expected life of the loans and future cash flows 
notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains additional information regarding humboldt s accounting policy for revenue recorded in connection with the sale of loans 
sba loan servicing rights are based upon estimates and are subject to the risk of prepayments and market value fluctuation 
accounting for stock based compensation for all years presented in the consolidated financial statements  humboldt accounted for stock options under the provisions apb no 
accordingly  no compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options is reflected in the income statements 
pro forma disclosures of the impact of compensation expense and related tax benefit associated with stock options are included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business segments sfas no 
requires disclosure of key financial information as measured by management in assessing performance of humboldt s key business segments  commercial banking and merchant bankcard services 
the disclosures related to the results for these lines of business are included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents summary of recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of this statement are to develop one accounting model  based upon the framework established in sfas no 
 for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
this statement requires that long lived assets being disposed of be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred 
the provisions of this statement were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and  generally  are to be applied prospectively 
the effect of this statement on humboldt s financial condition and results of operations  and with respect to the accounting for humboldt s discontinued leasing operations  was not material 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  sfas  accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers  and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
these rescissions eliminate the requirement to report gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect  and are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and requires that capital leases that are modified so that the resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease be accounted for as a sale leaseback 
this amendment is effective for transactions occurring after may  finally  this statement amends several pronouncements to make technical corrections to existing authoritative pronouncements 
the effect of this statement on humboldt s financial condition and results of operations was not material in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on humboldt s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides three alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the impact on reported financial results 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
this statement is effective for fiscal and interim periods ending after december  humboldt has elected to adopt the prospective transition method effective january  and  accordingly  compensation expense will be recognized for any stock options granted on or after that date 
the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for under the provisions of apb opinion no 
management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on humboldt s financial condition or results of operations in since the method of determining the value of stock options prescribed under sfas no 
is based on a valuation model that relies upon factors that are beyond humboldt s control  such as stock price volatility and market interest rates  management is not able to accurately predict the cost of options that may be granted in the future and the resulting impact on humboldt s financial condition and results of operations 
additional information regarding stock options is contained in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in humboldt s proxy statement 
in november  the fasb issued fin  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified 
table of contents after december  the adoption of these recognition provisions will result in recording liabilities associated with certain guarantees provided by the bank  including standby letters of credit 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  management does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on humboldt s financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities called variable interest entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after january  the consolidation requirements apply to all variable interest entities created after january  in addition  public companies must apply the consolidation requirements to variable interest entities that existed prior to february  and remain in existence as of the beginning of annual or interim periods beginning after june  management is currently assessing the impact of fin  and does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on humboldt s financial condition or results of operations 
the bank has investments in two limited partnerships that operate qualified multi family affordable housing projects and generate tax credits 
the bank s interest in these partnerships was approximately  at december  the assets and liabilities of these partnerships consist primarily of apartment complexes and related debt 
the bank accounts for the investments under the equity method  and therefore the carrying value approximates its underlying equity in the net assets of the partnerships 
management believes that these two limited partnerships could be defined as variable interest entities and  therefore  be required to consolidate for all reporting periods after june  additional information regarding investments in limited partnerships is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income statement summary for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  and net income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share 
the results of continuing operations produced a return on average assets of and a return on average shareholders equity of

the loss from discontinued operations for was related to the wind down of humboldt s leasing subsidiary  and totaled million  or per diluted share 
the results of continuing operations for reflect the impact of certain expenses associated with humboldt s merger with tehama bancorp 
excluding these costs on an after tax basis  the net income from continuing operations for was million 
net income and net income from continuing operations for were both million  or per diluted share 
net interest income net interest income is the most significant source of humboldt s operating income 
net interest income for totaled million  an increase of million  or  over net interest income for totaled million  an increase of million  or over the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest revenue 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread ignores the beneficial impact of non interest bearing deposits and capital  and provides a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percent of total average earning assets  which includes the positive impact of obtaining a portion of the funding for earning assets with non interest bearing deposits and capital

nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance 
net interest margin is computed by dividing net interest income by total average earning assets 
humboldt s net interest margin for was  an increase of basis points over this was a result of a combination of factors that allowed the cost of interest bearing liabilities to be reduced by basis 
table of contents points  while the yield on average earning assets declined by only basis points 
after an evaluation was conducted during the fourth quarter of  management decided to stop offering premium rate certificates of deposit at certain branches that had historically obtained most of their funding by that method 
as a result of this change  a substantial portion of the premium rate certificates of deposit did not remain with the bank after maturity and average certificates of deposit outstanding for decreased by approximately million  or  from the prior period 
this outflow was funded principally by a reduction in federal funds sold from an average outstanding balance of million in to zero in  and a combination of long and short term fhlb borrowings 
management also aggressively lowered rates on interest bearing transaction accounts during  resulting in a reduction in the average rate paid by basis points from the prior year  while short term market rates remained relatively flat until november the reduction in the average yield on earning assets for was partially mitigated by the initiation of a hedging strategy during the first quarter of  proactive management of the bank s investment securities portfolio and disciplined loan pricing 
the hedging strategy involved utilizing interest rate swap contracts to synthetically convert million of the bank s loan portfolio from floating to fixed rates 
for  the interest income on loans reflects  related to the loan portfolio hedging contracts  resulting in an increase in the average yield on loans of approximately basis points 
during the second quarter of  management conducted a comprehensive review of the bank s securities portfolio  of which over one third of the investments are mortgage related see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this review resulted in the sale of approximately million of securities which management believed would not perform well under the expected market rate environment 
a like amount of similar securities was purchased to replace those sold  with an increased duration of approximately years  allowing for an improvement in the overall yield on investment securities 
the loan pricing discipline utilized by humboldt includes negotiating for a risk appropriate rate on all loans  including caps and floors on adjustable rate loans when possible  and using market based tools to establish target rates on fixed rate loans of three years or more 
during  the federal reserve lowered short term market interest rates a record times  reducing the target federal funds rate by basis points over the course of the year 
humboldt s margin for was  a decrease of basis points from the average yield on earning assets declined by basis points during  principally due the downward repricing of humboldt s adjustable rate loans  which lowered the average yield on loans by basis points  cash flows from investment securities reinvested at lower market rates  and a increase in the average federal funds sold balance at an average rate of basis points lower than during the first three quarters of  management did not aggressively lower the offering rates on certificates of deposit or rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts given the level of uncertainty with respect to potential customer reaction 
as a result  the average cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by only basis points during as described above  a more aggressive position with respect to deposit rates was adopted during the fourth quarter of and full year the most significant impact on humboldt net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rate earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the volume of interest earning asset dollars in loans and investments  compared to the volume of interest bearing liabilities represented by deposits and borrowings  combined with the spread  produces the changes in the net interest income between periods 
table sets forth  for the years indicated  a summary of the changes in net interest income due to changes in average asset and liability balances volume and changes in average interest rates rate

investment securities the composition of humboldt s investment securities portfolio reflects management s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
the investment securities portfolio also provides a means of balance with respect to interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits 
humboldt s investment securities portfolio is managed based on a total return concept  that takes into consideration the yield on individual securities and the market value appreciation under various interest rate scenarios at specified future time horizons 
the portfolio has  historically  been comprised principally of mortgage related securities generally about two thirds of the total and bank qualified municipal obligations 
the mortgage related securities include both pooled mortgage back issues and high quality cmo structures  with an average duration in the range of three to five years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile even in the best structures due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the historically low mortgage interest rates experienced during resulted in the acceleration of cash flows from the mortgage related securities  which were then reinvested in similar securities at current market rates 
the structure of most of the mortgage related securities provides for minimal extension risk in the event of increased market rates 
during both and  management actively reviewed the investment securities portfolio on a regular basis in light of declining market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and humboldt s comprehensive asset liability management program 
as a result of these reviews  certain securities were sold during and that  in management s opinion  were unlikely to perform well given expected market rates 
the proceeds received in connection with the sales were used to purchase additional securities of approximately the same amount as those sold

humboldt s loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate  residential real estate  commercial industrial and consumer loans 
while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  humboldt s lending operations are dependent on the local economy

as a result of this review  which analyzed the revenue and expense associated with servicing  a decision was made to discontinue the practice of selling residential mortgage loans with the servicing retained and to originate and sell all conforming loans on a servicing released basis 
in connection with this evaluation  the servicing rights associated with approximately million of residential mortgage loans was sold during the third quarter of for cash consideration 
a pre tax loss of  was recognized in connection with this transaction

humboldt records an asset representing the right to service loans for others when it sells a loan and retains the servicing rights 
the carrying value of loans is allocated between the loan and the servicing rights  based on their relative fair values 
fair value is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows from the servicing assets using discount rates that approximate current market rates and using current expected future prepayment rates 
the servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income  assuming prepayments 
asset quality and non performing assets humboldt manages asset quality and controls credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices 
humboldt s loan administration function is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed by the bank s credit administration department through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses  as well as determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews are performed by an independent third party and bank staff  and consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  anticipated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and other factors 
there were no significant changes in the estimation methods and assumptions used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses during or additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in contained in part i of this report in the section titled lending and credit functions

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current interest income 
depending on management s evaluation of the borrower and loan collateral  interest on a nonaccrual loan may be recognized on a cash basis as payments are received 
loans made to facilitate the sale of other real estate are made on terms comparable to loans of similar risk

based on the evaluation of current market conditions  loan collateral  other secondary sources of repayment and cash flow generation  management does not anticipate any significant losses related to these loans 
these loans are subject to continuing management attention and are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
a decline in the economic conditions in humboldt s market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual or transferred to other real estate owned in the future

humboldt bancorp had outstanding at december  a balance of million on an amortizing term loan 
this loan has monthly payments of principal and interest  and matures in october humboldt bancorp also had outstanding as of december  a balance of approximately  on an amortizing term loan that matures in april bfs had  as of december   an obligation in the amount of approximately million that is structured so the sole source of repayment of principal and interest is cash flows arising out of retained interest assets related to certain lease backed securitizations 
since the retained interest assets were written off during the second quarter of  this liability will eventually be recovered as a gain either as cash flows are received in connection with the retained interests and passed to the lender  or when it is determined that the cash flows from retained interests will not be sufficient to repay the debt 
liquidity and cash flow the objective of humboldt s liquidity management is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of its customers who either wish to withdraw funds or require funds to meet their credit needs 
humboldt must manage its liquidity position to meet the needs of its customers while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment expectations of its shareholders 
humboldt monitors the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank can utilize established credit lines  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  secure fhlb advances or purchase overnight federal funds 
humboldt bancorp is a company separate and apart from the bank 
it must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of humboldt bancorp s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to humboldt bancorp 
management believes that such restrictions will not have an impact on the ability of humboldt bancorp to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
as disclosed in humboldt s consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the major sources of cash provided by operating activities are net income and the increase in interest payable and other liabilities

humboldt bancorp had borrowing availability of million under two lines of credit as of december  commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments to extend credit  credit card arrangements  and standby letters of credit as of december  were approximately million  million and million respectively 
management expects the bank s liquidity position to remain satisfactory during however  the planned exit from the merchant processing business will have an adverse impact on liquidity  since approximately million of deposits held as merchant loss reserves will be transferred to other financial institutions prior to march management expects that wholesale funding sources  including brokered certificates of deposit  will be used to replace these outflows on a short term basis while initiatives to increase core deposits are being implemented

the board of governors of the federal reserve system has issued guidelines for the implementation of risk based capital requirements by us banks and bank holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulators  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
humboldt s tier i capital  which consists of stockholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include supplemental capital components such as a qualifying allowance for loan losses and qualifying subordinated debt 
tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was million at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end stockholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies 
humboldt s leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
humboldt initiated the payment of a quarterly cash dividend in june and paid total cash dividends of  during any decision to pay cash dividends in the future will be based on humboldt s results of operations  growth expectations  financial condition  regulatory constraints and other factors considered important by the board of directors 
all three of the capital ratios of the bank currently exceed the minimum ratios required at december  as defined by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios to ensure that the bank remains 
table of contents within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios of humboldt and the bank is provided in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on february   humboldt announced a common stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
table below presents the number of shares repurchased and average price paid for the first authorization during table shares repurchased for the quarter ended march  june  september  december  four quarters shares repurchased average price paid additionally  on july   humboldt announced a second common stock repurchase program that authorized repurchase of up to million shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
no shares were repurchased under the second authorization during both of the repurchase programs may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without notice 
the extent to which humboldt repurchases its shares and the timing of such purchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on humboldt s profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve humboldt s overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
humboldt s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
humboldt manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets periodically and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and or earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors reviews and approves the asset liability management policy on an annual basis and reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of humboldt s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in humboldt s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate  one to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
table sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents table interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity in months to to to over total dollars in thousands earning assets net loans investment securities interest bearing deposits with banks total interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits borrowings trust preferred securities total interest rate swap contracts interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap total assets as shown in the preceding table  during the first year of interest bearing liabilities will reprice compared with of all interest earning assets 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to humboldt s prime lending rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have significant impact on humboldt s net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of humboldt s exposure to changes in interest rates 
humboldt utilizes an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on humboldt s net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in table the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of humboldt s balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months 
in addition  the simulation includes the impact of million in interest rate swap contracts that are described below 
table increase decrease in net interest percentage scenario income from base scenario change dollars in thousands up basis points up basis points down basis points based on the simulation model net income should increase slightly when rates increase and shrink somewhat when rates fall 
this is because of the concentration of variable rate and short term loans in 
table of contents humboldt s portfolio 
however  there can be no assurance that fluctuations in interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on humboldt 
to assist in achieving a desired level of interest rate sensitivity  humboldt has entered into off balance sheet contracts that are considered derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments can be a cost and capital effective means of modifying the repricing characteristics of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
the following table presents humboldt s derivative contracts as of december  issue notional rate rate maturity hedge hedged fair date amount paid received date type instrument value january  january cash flow loans july  july cash flow loans december  june fair value callable cd december  december cash flow trust preferred variable rate based on prime variable rate based on prime variable rate based on libor basis points fixed rate additional information about the derivative instruments is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
humboldt records all derivative financial instruments at fair value on the balance sheet 
humboldt s derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value or cash flow hedges 
fair value hedges recognize currently in earnings both the impact of change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument and the offsetting impact of the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
the change in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative meets the value correlation requirements for being considered highly effective 
management expects that all derivative contracts will meet the requirements for classification as highly effective for the term of each contract 
humboldt s policy requires all derivative financial instruments be used only for asset liability management through the hedging of specific transactions or positions  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended impact on humboldt s financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation  deflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investments in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends on humboldt s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
humboldt has an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
with the continued economic weakness experienced by the us economy during and historically low market interest rates  the potential for a deflationary economic environment has been publicized 
although the federal reserve bank has indicated that deflation is unlikely and that  if deflation were detected  swift action would be taken to stimulate spending and the economy 
during a period of deflation  prices fall and real short term interest rates are negative  and consumers and businesses generally tend to defer purchases of goods and services waiting for prices to fall further  which can exacerbate recessionary conditions 
a deflationary 
table of contents economic environment would adversely impact financial institutions  including humboldt  through the decline in demand for additional loans  contraction of the net interest margin and potentially higher loan losses 
discontinued operations bfs was originally capitalized in with  contributions from both humboldt bancorp and tehama bancorp 
upon the completion of the tehama bancorp merger in march  humboldt became the sole shareholder of bfs 
during the first quarter of  humboldt s board of directors completed a strategic review of bfs  which principally acquired and serviced small ticket leases on a nationwide basis 
this review was initiated in response to a number of factors  including the increased regulatory burden associated with bfs being a wholly owned subsidiary after completion of the tehama bancorp merger  future capital needs of bfs to support its growth and reliance upon the lease backed securities market for liquidity 
as a result of this review  humboldt adopted a plan to discontinue the operations of bfs by sale of the company and engaged an investment banking firm to facilitate the sale during the first quarter of a valuation reserve of  net of tax  was recorded during the first quarter of based on an estimate of the value of bfs as a going concern

the placement agent was able to place approximately  million of the class c leased backed notes with a non affiliated investor  however  due to certain restrictions contained in the indenture  the transaction had to be structured as a secured borrowing 
the result of the transaction on the balance sheet of bfs was the establishment of an asset for the class c leased backed notes and a related liability for  this secured borrowing agreement also contained a provision whereby bfs was permitted  for a limited period of time  to retain the monthly principal and interest cash flows received on the leased backed notes
