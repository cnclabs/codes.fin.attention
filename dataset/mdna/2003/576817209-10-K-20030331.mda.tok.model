critical accounting estimates a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
the company s critical accounting estimates are as follows revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
revenues for the women s health segment are generated by providing services through patient service centers 
revenues from this segment are recognized as the related services are rendered and are net of contractual allowances and related discounts 
the health enhancement segment provides services through its patient service centers  provides supplies to patients primarily on a mail order basis  and assembles  packages and distributes diabetes products 
revenues for services are recognized when services are provided and revenues from product sales are recognized when products are shipped 
revenues from this segment are recorded net of contractual and other discounts 
the company s clinical services and supply business are reimbursed on a fee for service per case or per item basis 
other aspects of disease management  however  are paid for primarily on the basis of monthly 
table of contents fees for each employee or member enrolled in a health plan  each member identified with a particular chronic disease or condition under contract  or each member enrolled in the company s program or on a case rate basis 
some of the contracts for these services provide that a portion of the company s fees is at risk subject to the company s performance against financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
thus  a portion of the company s revenues is subject to confirmation of the company s performance against these financial cost savings and clinical criteria 
estimates for performance under the terms of these contracts and other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as information related to performance levels and associated fees become available 
as of december   less than of the company s revenues are at risk under these arrangements 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is billed to third party reimbursement sources 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the company s trade accounts receivable is susceptible to changes in third party reimbursement policies 
a provision for doubtful accounts is made for revenues estimated to be uncollectible and is adjusted periodically based upon the company s evaluation of current industry conditions  historical collection experience  recoveries of amounts previously provided  industry reimbursement trends  audit activity and other relevant factors which  in the opinion of management  deserve recognition in estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
see recently issued accounting standards below for a description of two new accounting pronouncements which have significantly changed the company s accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in and beyond 
as of december   the company had unamortized goodwill of million and unamortized intangible assets of million  which represented approximately of total assets 
under the new accounting standards  the company s goodwill is no longer being amortized to expense  but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually 
other intangible assets are continuing to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment 
in testing for impairment  the company will evaluate the financial earnings prospects of the acquired companies to which the goodwill and other intangibles relate and determine whether changed circumstances indicate that any portion of the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable 
accounting for income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
additionally  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the income tax benefit of million for reflected a lower benefit than the statutory tax rate due to various non deductible permanent differences between tax and financial accounting 
the tax provisions recorded for and were million and million  respectively 
cash outflows for income taxes in  and totaled  million and million  respectively  being comprised of federal alternative minimum taxes  and state and foreign taxes for jurisdictions where net operating losses were not available 
as of december   the company s remaining net operating losses of million  the tax effect of which is reflected in the deferred tax asset  will be available to offset future tax liabilities 
based on projections of taxable income in and future years  management believes that  more likely than not  the company will fully realize the value of the recorded deferred income tax assets 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially 
table of contents different result 
see the notes to consolidated financial statements which contain additional accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of the accounting estimates  and this disclosure  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and specifies criteria intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas in and sfas effective january  sfas required  upon adoption of sfas  that the company evaluate its existing goodwill and intangible assets that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations and make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in sfas for recognition apart from goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas  the company also was required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired and to make any necessary amortization period adjustments 
as of january   the date of adoption of sfas  the company had unamortized goodwill of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets of million  all of which were subject to the transition provisions of sfas and sfas during the first quarter of  the company evaluated the fair values of the business segments identified under the provisions of sfas and sfas and concluded that no impairment of recorded goodwill existed 
likewise  such an evaluation was performed as of december   again resulting in a conclusion that no impairment existed 
as a result  no amortization of goodwill was recorded in amortization expense related to goodwill was approximately million in both and also  the company reassessed the useful lives  residual values and classification of identifiable intangible assets and determined that they continue to be appropriate 
amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets was  in  and also  in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
an asset retirement obligation refers to any type of closure or removal costs that are incurred at any time during the life of an asset 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  the entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
sfas was effective for the company beginning january  the company does not expect sfas to have a significant effect on its financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections sfas 
sfas rescinded fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
sfas concludes that debt extinguishments are often a routine  recurring part 
table of contents of an entity s risk management strategy and may not meet the criteria for classification as extraordinary items in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
it also rescinded fasb statement no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
sfas amended fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
it also amended other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
sfas had no impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between sfas and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in sfas is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue it also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
both of those methods avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value based method 
in addition  to address concerns raised by some constituents about the lack of comparability caused by multiple transition methods  sfas does not permit the use of the original sfas prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value based method made in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  sfas amended the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in the absence of a single accounting method for stock based employee compensation  sfas requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
sfas improves the prominence and clarity of the pro forma disclosures required by sfas by prescribing a specific tabular format and by requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies 
in addition  sfas improves the timeliness of those disclosures by requiring their inclusion in financial reports for interim periods 
the company has elected to not adopt the fair value based method of accounting  and therefore provides the pro forma disclosures required by sfas and sfas the company s disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements contain all of the new disclosure requirements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
interpretation 
interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
interpretation no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or 
table of contents modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
the disclosure requirements were effective for the quarter ended december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no
