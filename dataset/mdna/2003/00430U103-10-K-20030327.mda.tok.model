business overview we design  develop  market  and support science and technology based products and services intended to improve and accelerate the processes of drug discovery and chemical development 
our software segment  accelrys inc accelrys  provides molecular modeling  simulation  informatics and decision support software for the life sciences and materials research markets 
our drug discovery segment  pharmacopeia drug discovery  inc pdd  provides drug discovery services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on proprietary combinatorial chemistry  high throughput screening and accelrys technologies 
segment and geographical data are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations compared to total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  software license  service and other revenue for the years ended december  and was million each year 
combined revenue including revenue from a strategic alliance in our largest geographic regions  europe and the united states was also consistent from year to year 
excluding the revenue from the strategic alliance  revenue in the combined european and us regions decreased by due to market conditions under which customers  particularly in the biotech sector  discontinued research  shifted their focus downstream to development  or went out of business 
revenue in asia increased  attributable to our direct sales in japan in the current year compared to discounted distributor sales in the prior year 
revenue growth was in modeling and simulation including the revenue from the strategic alliance  while informatics revenue decreased by 
the decrease in informatics revenue was attributable primarily to the market conditions described above 
drug discovery revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to additional revenue earned under collaborative drug discovery agreements  increased milestone revenue  and million from a revenue adjustment recorded in the third quarter of resulting from a positive change in our estimate of costs required to complete a contract 
milestone revenue recorded in the year ended december  and was million  and million  respectively 
excluding the revenue from milestones and the adjustment  revenue increased from year to year 
in and  one drug discovery customer accounted for and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
software license  service and other gross margin decreased to million of related revenue in the year ended december  compared to million of related revenue in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to additional costs incurred related to enhancements of the post sales support function  and additional direct costs associated with the revenue from a strategic alliance 
drug discovery gross margin increased to million of related revenue in the year ended december  compared to million of related revenue in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted from the higher revenue level  including milestone revenue and the revenue adjustment  which carry no associated cost of revenue 
excluding the effect of the milestone revenue and the revenue adjustment on gross margin  total gross margin increased by  which is attributable primarily to planned cost reductions related to existing contracts and the effect of fixed costs spread over a larger revenue base 
cost efficiencies have been achieved on existing contracts and cannot be assured on future contracts 
research and development expense decreased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  research and development costs include software development costs and costs associated with internal drug discovery programs 
the decrease in research and development expense is attributable to cost efficiencies realized in the software business due to the consolidation of research efforts on accelrys expanded product line and due to efficiencies realized from standardization of products on a common platform 
additionally  cost decreases in the drug discovery business  related to the reduction of non chemistry and biology research activities  were planned in and fully realized in research and development expense in the drug discovery business  however  may increase if efforts on internally funded programs expand 
sales  general and administrative expense increased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales  general and administrative expense is attributable largely to increases in sales staff and management infrastructure  particularly in japan 
additionally  expense associated with a new facility and facility consolidation  severance  and excess consulting capacity in the current year totaled approximately million with no corresponding expense in the prior year 
finally  approximately million of the full year increase was attributable to the sales  general and administrative expense of synomics limited  acquired in june excluding the foregoing items  sales  general and administrative expense increased by 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of related to actions taken to improve our financial performance 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
no goodwill amortization was recorded in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to changes in accounting rules 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
no discontinued acquisition costs were recorded in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  prior period amounts were reclassified from sales  general and administrative expense 
interest and other income  net  decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  interest and other income  net  in the comparable prior year period included a million capital gain related to the sale of an investment 
approximately million of the decrease is due to decreases in average investment balances and decreases in market interest rates  and the remaining difference relates to translation of certain current assets denominated in foreign currencies and other non operating expenses 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the and tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated by the software business 
these provisions differ from the federal tax rate primarily because of the effect of permanent book tax differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and net operating loss carrybacks 
there was no net income from discontinued hardware operations for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  hardware re sale operations were discontinued in see note to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the factors described above  the company generated a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december  net loss in the prior year period was made up of a net loss from continuing operations of million per diluted share partially offset by income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share 
compared to total revenue grew to million in compared to million in  excluding hardware re sale revenue 
hardware re sale operations were discontinued in accelrys software license  service and other revenue increased to million in compared to million in this increase includes revenues generated from sales of products and services added through the acquisitions of synopsys scientific systems limited and the software subsidiaries of oxford molecular group plc in and the acquisition of synomics limited in hereinafter collectively the acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of the acquisitions  software license  service  and other revenue increased in compared to accelrys software license  service  and other revenue increased to million in in the european and us region combined  including the effect of the acquisitions 
excluding the effect of the acquisitions  organic european and us region software license  service  and other revenue increased 
accelrys software license  service  and other revenue decreased to million in the asia region 
the decrease was due to a renegotiated minimum volume commitment with accelrys distribution partner  under which modeling and simulation software revenues in japan were not expected to increase beyond the level achieved in this minimum volume commitment and related distribution agreement terminated december  drug discovery revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the results included an aggregate million from a non recurring technology out license fee  and a contract termination fee 
the and results also included milestone revenue of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the results included million of revenue from a drug discovery collaboration that terminated in june excluding the non recurring technology out license fee  the revenue and fees from the terminated collaboration  and the milestone revenues  drug discovery revenue declined by primarily due to declines in general economic conditions and competitive pressures 
in and  one drug discovery customer accounted for of consolidated revenue 
accelrys gross margin increased to million of related revenues in compared to million of related revenues in the increase in the amount of gross margin dollars resulted from the increase in software license  service  and other revenue as described above 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of related revenues is primarily due to the amortization of the developed technology intangible asset identified in the acquisitions 
excluding this amortization  gross margin as a percentage of related revenues for would have been approximately equal to gross margin as a percentage of related revenues in drug discovery gross margin decreased to million of related revenues in compared to million of related revenues in the decrease in gross margin dollars resulted primarily from the decrease in revenue described above 
the decrease in drug discovery gross margin as a percentage of related revenue is due to the non recurring technology out license revenue  the contract termination revenue  and the milestone revenues which carried no associated cost of revenue  and to the decreased volume of work which caused fixed costs to be spread over the lower revenue level 
research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in including the effect of the acquisitions 
research and development costs include costs associated with internal drug discovery programs and software development 
all of the increase in research and development costs occurred at accelrys  and resulted both from the acquisitions and from increased costs associated with the further development of modeling  simulation  analysis  informatics  and workflow software 
accelrys increased its software and informatics research and development staff in response to the anticipated product integration needs of its expanded software product line 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase in sales  general  and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the acquisitions  including amortization of certain acquired intangible assets identified in the acquisitions  and increases in the depth and breath of skills in the sales force required in order to sell the combined product line 
goodwill amortization increased to million for compared to million for the increase is attributable to the timing of the acquisitions 
goodwill will not be amortized in the future due to recently issued accounting standards described below 
a write off of million of in process research and development was recorded for and was related to the acquisitions 
no comparable write offs were made in discontinued acquisition costs of million were written off in no comparable write offs were made in net interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is due to increases in average investment balances offset by decreases in market interest rates 
the provision for income taxes decreased to million in compared to million in the tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated at accelrys 
these provisions differ from the expected tax rate primarily because of the effect of net operating loss carryforwards and carrybacks 
as a result of the increased revenue and gross margin  increased operating expenses and one time charges  and the other matters described above  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million  or per basic and diluted share in  as compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per basic and diluted share in income from the re sale of computer hardware decreased by to million  or per basic and diluted share in  as compared to million  or per basic and diluted share in these hardware re sale operations were discontinued in net loss was million  or per basic and diluted share in  as compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share in liquidity and capital resources we have funded our activities to date primarily through the sales of equity securities  and sales of software licenses  software maintenance services  and drug discovery services 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million as of december  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
cash provided by operations decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the decrease in operating earnings excluding the effect of goodwill amortization which was discontinued in  partially offset by improvements in the collection of trade receivables 
cash used in investing activities increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to increased expenditures for information technology infrastructure  leasehold improvements at the new accelrys facility in cambridge  united kingdom  and the timing of investments in marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to purchases of treasury stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
we anticipate that our capital requirements may increase in future periods as a result of seasonal sales trends  additional research and development activities  and the acquisition of additional equipment 
our capital requirements may also increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances  or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations at least through however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  our ability to extend existing drug discovery agreements and to enter into additional arrangements  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the outcome of related litigation  the purchase of additional capital equipment  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  and the progress of our customers milestone and royalty producing activities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures involve the use of judgments and estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  as amended by sop and sop and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
we recognize accelrys software license revenue upon delivery if no significant obligations remain deliverable to the customer  the sales contract fee is fixed or determinable  amounts are due within one year and collection is probable  and when no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance exist 
customer payments received in connection with license sales are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as all of the above criteria are met 
prepaid post contract support and maintenance pcs revenue bundled with software license agreements is unbundled and deferred based on objective  vendor specific evidence 
pcs revenue is recognized pro rata over the related service period  which is generally one year 
consulting and training fees are recognized upon rendering of service 
support revenues are recognized ratably over the applicable contract periods or as services are performed 
amounts billed but not yet recognized as revenue  and other payments received prior to recognition of revenue  are recorded as deferred revenue 
we also earn software revenue under consortia agreements wherein several unrelated parties enter into a joint software development agreement with us 
these agreements are generally one to three years in length  require an annual membership fee  and contain best efforts development milestones 
customers receive a consortium membership  a software library  and related software and maintenance support 
the portion of consortium fees associated with the initial software library is recognized upon delivery  while consortium fees associated with consortium membership and software maintenance are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
we are not required to deliver specified products under the agreements and the consortium fees are generally non refundable 
if we are successful in developing software under a consortia agreement as described above  a non transferable license is typically awarded to the consortium members 
accordingly  recognition of software licence  service and other revenue is dependent  in part  on management judgment 
since management s judgment is involved  changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact revenue recognition in the future 
we recognize revenue from drug discovery primarily using the percentage of completion method 
accordingly  revenue is recognized as service deliverables are expended against a total research and development plan 
payments received prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue 
non refundable payments are recognized as revenue only when they are not subject to future performance obligations 
otherwise  such payments are deferred and amortized into revenue over the term of the agreement 
our revenue recognition policies  in particular as they relate to percentage of completion arrangements  are based on estimates and assumptions by management that are subject to change depending on the contract 
as such  any change in our estimates could impact revenue recognition in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on a specific customer analysis  and an additional amount may be provided when and if an account becomes uncollectible at a later date 
if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  an additional allowance would be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  therefore  is based on estimates made by management 
since management s judgment is involved  there is a risk that the estimate may be overstated or understated which could impact operating results in the future 
software development costs we capitalize software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
such costs are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
capitalized software costs are comprised of costs incurred in the development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products after technological feasibility has been established 
we amortize capitalized costs over the estimated product life  not to exceed three years from the date on which the product is available for general release 
the estimated product life may be reduced based on obsolescence or other factors  which could affect the carrying value of capitalized software and result in charges to operating results 
these estimates are based on management s judgment 
since management s judgment is involved  any change in our estimates could impact operating results in the future 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas during the quarter ended march  under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are assessed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
in making this annual assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
we completed our annual intangible asset impairment test during the quarter ended december   and concluded that the carrying value of our goodwill was not impaired 
continued economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units  and additional non temporary market capitalization declines may be indicative of goodwill impairment and cause us to perform additional valuation analyses for our reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in charges for goodwill expense in the future 
income taxes estimates of full year taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation  which change throughout the year 
management uses judgment in estimating what the income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period  and that operating results could be impacted in the future 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus of eitf will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
is an amendment to sfas no 
providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and also provides additional disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
amendments are effective for financial statements for the company ending after december  the company has currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if the company should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks consisting primarily of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales generally are denominated in local currencies 
in  of our consolidated revenue was derived from customers outside the united states including from customers in europe and from customers in the asia pacific region 
our exchange rate risk is greatest for dollar euro and dollar yen fluctuations 
when deemed appropriate  we engage in exchange rate hedging transactions in an attempt to mitigate the impact of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in effect 
the introduction and use of the euro  which began in  has not had a material effect on our foreign exchange or hedging activities 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the euro  however  based on currently available information 
we do not believe that the introduction of the euro currency will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition  cash flows  or results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we regularly invest excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements that are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
our exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio  since we have minimal debt 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risks  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  however  declines in interest rates that occurred in may result in some level of decrease to our interest income in as compared to the amount earned in additional declines in interest rates over time would further reduce our interest income
