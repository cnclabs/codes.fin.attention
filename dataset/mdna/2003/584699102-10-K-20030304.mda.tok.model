readers are cautioned that these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
readers are referred to the forward looking statements and risk factors sections in part i  item of this document 
overview since  medimmune has been focused on using biotechnology to produce innovative products to prevent or treat infectious disease  autoimmune disease and cancer 
having made significant advances in the last several years  medimmune is now a fully integrated company with the ability and infrastructure to take a product from discovery through development  manufacturing  and into the market via our oncology  pediatric  and hospital based sales forces 
during january  we acquired aviron the acquisition  a biopharmaceutical company focused on preventing disease through innovative vaccine technologies 
the operating results of aviron  which was subsequently renamed medimmune vaccines  inc  have been included in our consolidated operating results beginning january  medimmune currently actively markets three products our flagship product synagis  which we launched in the united states in  ethyol and cytogam 
our leading product candidate  flumist  an influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal mist  is under regulatory review by the fda 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements acquired in process research and development we recorded a charge of  million during the year ended december  for the write off of purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisition 
the write off represents the fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated as the sum of probability adjusted commercial scenarios 
this method is based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda approval and commercial success for flumist 
as with all biotechnology products  the probability of fda approval and commercial success for any particular research and development project is highly uncertain 
management s projections were based on assumptions  which may or may not remain valid for the relevant period  including the estimated impact of four key factors price per dose  dose volume  launch date  and the potential failure of the frozen or liquid formulations of the influenza vaccine 
based on current information  management believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the fair value analysis are reasonable 
inventory reserves most of the inventory components for flumist have expiration dates that range from to months 
through september  we produced inventory in anticipation of a possible launch of flumist for the flu season 
at that time  we recognized that fda approval would not be received in time for a launch for the flu season  and we recorded a full reserve for the inventory components we believed would not be used prior to reaching their expiration dates 
in the fourth quarter of  we began production of certain inventory components in anticipation of a possible launch of flumist for the flu season  as fda approval is expected to be received in the second quarter of if not sooner 
with respect to all inventory components on hand as of december   we reviewed the following assumptions to determine the amount of any additional reserves the expected date of approval  the expected sales volume  the concentration of viral material in our vaccine  potential changes in the influenza strains recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention for each season s vaccine  anticipated changes in the manufacturing process and other variables associated with product launch efforts 
as of december   we have million of inventory against which we have a reserve of million  resulting in a net inventory balance of million 
should flumist be approved for the flu season and sales levels are higher than expected  we may be able to utilize more inventory than anticipated  and as such  our margins would be favorably impacted in these periods when the inventory is sold 
conversely  should flumist not be approved  or if sales levels are lower than expected  we may have further reserves or writedowns for obsolete inventory 
for our other products  we periodically assess our inventory balances to determine whether net realizable value is below recorded cost 
factors we consider include expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates 
sales allowances and other sales related estimates we estimate the amount of sales discounts and sales returns  recorded as a reduction of gross product sales  by applying rates determined by our past experience to actual sales for the period 
we estimate our co promotion expense and sales commissions  recorded as selling  general and administrative expense  by applying an estimated rate that is based upon an estimate of projected sales for the season  to our actual sales for the period 
we estimate the level of bad debts based upon our assessment of the concentration of credit risk  the financial condition and environment of our customers  the level of credit insurance we obtain on our customers and the expected impact of current reimbursement issues our customers experience 
we estimate the aggregate amount of government reimbursements  recorded as a reduction to gross product sales  based upon historical experience and our best estimate of the proportion of the seasonal sales that will be subject to this reimbursement  largely comprised of medicaid payments to state governments 
if our historical trends are not indicative of the future  or our actual seasonal sales are materially different from projected amounts  or if our assessments prove to be materially different than actual occurrence  our results could be affected 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of million to co promotion expense  resulting from the final reconciliation of gross to net sales for the contract year 
during and  the adjustments were not material 
taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is anticipated to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should we determine that we were able to realize more than the recorded amounts of net deferred tax assets in the future  our net income would increase in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  our net income would decrease in the period such determination was made 
investments we regularly enter into collaborative research and development agreements with strategic partners 
as part of the agreements  we may obtain common stock  preferred stock or other equity securities in these strategic partners 
these companies may be public or privately held companies 
at the time the securities are obtained  we determine if the investment should be accounted for under the cost method  equity method  or consolidation method based upon multiple factors including percentage ownership of the company  representation on board of directors  participation in policy making processes  technological dependency  veto rights of partners  our role on key technical or product development committees  revenue dependence  and other extraordinary voting rights 
investments accounted for under the equity method are adjusted quarterly for the company s proportionate share of the investee s gains or losses  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
each quarter  we evaluate all of our investments  and recognize an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations when a decline in the fair value of an investment falls below its cost value and is judged to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  fundamental changes to the business prospects of the investee  share prices of subsequent offerings  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
results of operations compared to to present our results in the same manner as we view the performance of the business and the resulting underlying trends  we have presented certain expense categories with and without certain acquisition related amounts  including the acquired in process research and development charge  amortization of intangible assets  compensation expense associated with the assumption and vesting of unvested stock options  retention and severance payments  and the amortization of the premium on convertible subordinated notes 
inclusion of such acquisition related expenses is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles 
where we exclude such expenses  we use the term adjusted 
revenues product sales growth in millions synagis ethyol other products product sales grew to million as compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales of synagis and the impact of reacquiring the domestic marketing rights to ethyol from alza as of october  synagis synagis accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our and product sales 
we achieved a increase in domestic synagis sales to million in  up from million in this growth was largely due to increased demand in the united states  and resulted in a increase in domestic units sold 
also aiding growth was a price increase that took effect in june  partially offset by an increase in sales allowances  which are accounted for as a reduction to product sales 
our reported international sales of synagis decreased to million in compared to million in  due to a decrease in units sold to ai  our exclusive distributor of synagis outside of the united states 
we believe that the decrease is due to reductions in the inventory stocking levels of ai  rather than reduced product demand by end users 
the decrease in unit volume was offset by an increase in the per unit sales price recognized upon delivery of product to ai under the terms of our international distribution agreement 
based on information received from ai  we believe that end user sales have increased over last year 
we record synagis international product sales based on ai s sales price to customers  as defined in the agreement 
we have been working with ai to expand the number of countries where we are licensed to sell synagis 
as of february   synagis had been approved for marketing in countries  including the united states  the most recent of which was canada in may there can be no assurance that approvals by the appropriate regulatory authorities will continue to be granted or that we will receive pricing and reimbursement approvals in countries where we have received regulatory approval 
ethyol ethyol accounted for approximately and of our product sales in and  respectively 
on october  we reacquired domestic marketing rights to ethyol from alza and have since recorded all revenues from domestic sales of ethyol to wholesalers and distributors 
as part of this agreement  no third quarter supply sales were made to alza  and we purchased alza s remaining ethyol inventory at their original purchase price  which was recorded as a reduction to product sales 
beginning april   we pay alza a declining royalty through based on net sales of ethyol in the united states 
domestic ethyol sales were million in  as compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to a three fold increase in domestic units sold in versus the year  which included nine months of revenues generated under our product supply agreement with alza and three months of sales to wholesalers and distributors 
further  two domestic price increases occurred during  including a increase in april and a increase in september in addition  included net returns of million  relating to our assumption of ethyol marketing rights 
prior to october   we recorded ethyol domestic product sales based on alza s net unit selling price as defined in the agreement 
our international sales of ethyol to our distribution partner  schering  were million for  down from the prior year sales of million 
we record ethyol international product sales based on a percentage of schering s end user sales  as defined in our agreement 
other products sales of other products in  which include sales of cytogam  neutrexin  respigam  and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process  decreased million  or compared to last year 
the decrease was due to marginal declines in all of our other product lines 
forward looking commentary we believe that the growth rate of our product sales  while still at double digit levels  will decelerate in however  the level of future product sales will depend on several factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and extent of future regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates  receiving reimbursement pricing  availability of finished product inventory  approval and commercialization of competitive products and the degree of acceptance of our products in the marketplace 
we continue to make progress in the fda review process for flumist 
on january   we received a crl from the fda containing five questions  to which we responded in early february we anticipate that we will receive fda approval for flumist during the second quarter of  if not sooner 
revenues other revenues other revenues increased to million for compared to million in the increase is largely attributable to million received from wyeth  our marketing partner for flumist  for compensation of flumist manufacturing costs under recent amendments to the collaborative agreements 
an increase of million in revenues from the sale of excess production capacity to a third party and million in funding for flumist clinical development and sales and marketing activities from wyeth also contributed to the growth over partially offsetting these increases is a decrease of million in revenue recorded under collaborative agreements  including a million decrease in clinical funding received for our hpv vaccine candidate as we are nearing completion of phase and clinical trials and our preparation of clinical material 
forward looking commentary we anticipate the level of other revenues to increase in largely due to milestone and royalty payments associated with the approval and commercialization of flumist 
the level of contract revenues in future periods will depend primarily upon the extent to which we enter into other collaborative contractual arrangements  if any  and the extent to which we achieve certain milestones provided for in existing agreements 
future revenues from the sale of excess production capacity will vary depending upon the extent to which we enter into these types of arrangements  and are not expected to be significant for or thereafter 
the expected timing of annual revenues to be recognized through under major collaborative agreements entered into before january   which we have accounted for using the contingency adjusted performance model and deferred a portion of the up front and milestone payments received  based on current estimates of costs to complete  is as follows in millions abbott laboratories schering plough corporation total cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million in  due to the increase in sales volumes and additional royalties owed for synagis  partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions following implementation of an improved manufacturing process at the fmc which enhances the yields for synagis 
as a result  gross margins for were down two percentage points to from for the year ended december  forward looking commentary we expect that gross margins may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  based on the product mix 
we expect that on an annual basis  our gross margin percentage for should be lower than  as a result of the anticipated launch of flumist 
research and development expenses research and development expenses of million in increased from million in excluding acquisition related amounts of million in for retention payments  stock option acceleration and stock compensation expense for unvested options assumed  research and development expenses were million  up over this increase was largely due to the on going activities of medimmune vaccines and payments of approximately million to gain access to various technologies and intellectual property to advance our pipeline 
these increases were offset by decreases in clinical trial expenses  as several of our clinical trials were either completed  cancelled or delayed during during  we completed several important clinical trials  including a successful phase trial for synagis in children with congenital heart disease and three phase trials for siplizumab 
during  we incurred significant costs related to the development of various products and product candidates 
a summary of our more significant research and development efforts is as follows development stage products description stage of development synagis potential prevention of rsv in infants with congenital heart disease phase completed siplizumab potential treatment for psoriasis phase urinary tract infection vaccine potential vaccine to prevent urinary tract infections caused by e 
coli terminated human papillomavirus vaccine potential vaccine to prevent cervical cancer phase completed vitaxin potential product to slow tumor growth and to prevent the progress of rheumatoid arthritis phase flumist influenza vaccine delivered as a nasal mist fda review as indicated in the table above  we completed the preliminary analysis of three phase trials for siplizumab involving almost psoriasis patients 
while the drug appeared to be generally well tolerated and some patients exhibited an improvement in their psoriatic disease  an anti antibody response also known as immunogenicity was observed in the laboratory tests of over percent of the patients 
this anti antibody response did not appear to cause any clinical complications 
in  we plan to conduct retreatment phase studies to further assess the potential clinical impact of the immunogenicity 
we also completed two phase trials of our e 
coli urinary tract infection vaccine  and have determined that there is not a sufficient level of efficacy in prevention of urinary tract infections to proceed with additional trials 
our ongoing clinical program also includes several product candidates in various phases of evaluation  including a phase trial in adults using a liquid formulation of synagis and certain trials for flumist 
additionally  we have multiple programs in preclinical development 
forward looking commentary we expect research and development expenses to be up slightly in compared to this is largely due to the impact of the conclusion of trials and studies as described above offset by the anticipation of post marketing commitments  additional trials associated with flumist and the continued progress of our pipeline candidates 
during  we entered into the several research collaborations and licensing agreements  which commit us to future payments of million  should certain events or milestones occur 
the development stage efforts listed above and other research and development projects may never reach clinical trials  achieve success in the clinic  be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval  or be approved for marketing or manufacturing by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
further  we rely on numerous third parties to assist us in various stages of the development process 
should they be unable to meet our needs  we may incur substantial additional costs 
any of such uncertainties  if they should occur  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in compared to million for the period 
excluding acquisition related amounts of million in expense in relating to retention payments  stock option acceleration and stock compensation for unvested stock options assumed and amortization of intangibles  sg a expenses were million  up over as a percentage of product sales  adjusted sg a expense increased to of product sales in the period from in the period 
the increase in this ratio is largely reflective of the impact of the acquisition and the inclusion of medimmune vaccines ongoing expenses 
additionally  we incurred increased co promotion expense directly related to the growth in domestic sales of synagis  higher salaries and sales commissions  as well as increased synagis marketing expense 
sg a expenses for also included a million charge associated with the settlement of a contractual dispute in august regarding an agreement with the massachusetts biologic laboratories of the university of massachusetts mbl to transfer certain technology relating to the company s monoclonal antibody manufacturing operations 
the comparison to last year is favorably impacted as million of expenses related to our accelerated acquisition of ethyol marketing rights from alza was included in sg a for forward looking commentary we expect sg a expenses as a percentage of product sales to decrease in  largely due to a shift in product sales mix 
other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs and other manufacturing related costs  increased to million in from million in excluding acquisition related amounts of million in expense in relating to stock compensation for unvested stock options assumed and amortization of intangibles  adjusted other operating expenses were million 
the increase over is primarily related to million of pre production costs and inventory reserves for flumist 
the majority of the cost incurred for flumist was associated with preparing for the aborted commercial launch 
additionally  we incurred a million charge for the write off of cytogam manufacturing equipment as the company has outsourced cytogam production activities as of november also included in other operating expense for both periods are excess capacity costs associated with the plasma production section of the fmc 
forward looking commentary we expect the level of other operating expenses will decline significantly in as we anticipate that approval of flumist will occur in the second quarter of  if not sooner 
in process research and development we incurred charges of  million for the year ended december  for the write off of purchased in process research and development in conjunction with the acquisition 
the write off represents the fair value of purchased in process technologies at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the sum of the probability adjusted scenarios under the income approach using a discount rate of  and certain in process research and development projects  primarily flumist 
we do not anticipate that there will be any alternative future use for the in process technologies that were written off 
flumist is a live  attenuated vaccine delivered via a nasal mist for the prevention of influenza 
it is a frozen vaccine requiring freezer storage 
a liquid influenza vaccine  better suited to international markets where freezers are not as readily available to pharmacists and physicians  is currently being developed by our partner wyeth 
while there are other flu vaccines currently marketed by other companies  flumist would be the only live virus vaccine administered as a nasal mist 
in october  we submitted a bla for flumist to the fda seeking approval for licensure 
we received a crl from the fda and filed our response to this letter in january a second crl was received from the fda in july requesting clarification and additional information relating to clinical data and chemistry  manufacturing and controls data previously submitted 
we submitted the requested information in august we met with the fda s vrbpac committee in december who voted favorably on the questions of safety and efficacy for flumist in preventing influenza in healthy children  adolescents and adults ages five through and safety for healthy individuals aged years 
on january   we received a third crl from the fda containing five questions  to which we responded in early february the valuation of the acquired in process research and development is based upon certain estimates and assumptions by management 
the valuation is based upon management s estimates of the probability of fda approval and commercial success for flumist 
as with all biotechnology products  the probability of fda approval and commercial success for any particular research and development project is highly uncertain 
management s projections were based on assumptions  which may or may not remain valid for the relevant period  including the estimated impact of four key factors price per dose  dose volume  launch date  and the potential failure of the frozen or liquid formulations of the influenza vaccine 
based on current information  management believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the fair value analysis are substantially accurate 
in addition  as of february   none of the existing manufacturing facilities involved in the production of flumist had been licensed by any regulatory agency and flumist had not yet been manufactured at a sustained commercial scale 
there can be no assurance that these facilities can achieve licensure by the fda or any other regulatory agency  or can there be any assurances that if licensed  commercial scale production could be achieved or sustained 
if we fail to obtain fda approval for the marketing and manufacture of flumist  we will absorb all of the related ongoing expenses while recording no corresponding revenue 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million for  compared to million in  reflecting higher cash balances available for investment  largely due to the acquisition  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates  which lowered the overall portfolio yield 
interest expense for  net of amounts capitalized  was million  up million over excluding the acquisition related amount of million for the amortization of premium on the convertible subordinated notes the notes  adjusted interest expense was million 
the increase over is due to interest expense on the notes assumed in the acquisition 
loss on investment activities we incurred million in losses on investment activities for the losses consisted primarily of impairment charges of million on our publicly traded equity investments and million on our minority interest investments related to declines in fair value that were judged to be other than temporary 
taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  excluding items not deductible for tax purposes  principally the write off of purchased in process research and development  the resulting effective tax rate is 
this compares to tax expense of million recorded for the year ended december   based on an effective tax rate of 
the higher effective tax rate for versus is due to lower credits estimated to be available for research and development activities  including credits earned for orphan drug status of certain research and development activities 
these credits will vary from year to year depending on the activities of the company 
forward looking commentary we expect that our effective tax rate will continue to be at approximately the same rate as net loss net loss for the year ended december  was billion  or per share compared to net earnings for the year ended december  of million or basic and diluted earnings per share 
excluding the after tax impact of the acquisition related amounts totaling billion  adjusted net earnings for were million  or adjusted earnings per diluted share 
shares used in computing net loss per share in were million 
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share for were million and million  respectively 
the increase in share count primarily reflects the million additional shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
forward looking commentary in  we expect to generate net earnings per diluted share 
the level of net earnings will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and extent of regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates  the degree of acceptance of our products in the marketplace and adequate product supply to meet demand 
results of operations compared to revenues product sales growth in millions synagis cytogam ethyol other products product sales grew to million in from million in  primarily due to increased sales of synagis 
synagis sales of synagis increased over from million to million in contributing to the growth was a increase in domestic synagis sales from million in to million in this growth was attributable to higher demand in the united states  resulting in a increase in domestic sales unit volume  and a increase in the domestic selling price of synagis effective in the second quarter of partially offsetting the increase was higher estimated government reimbursements  which were accounted for as a reduction of product sales  as synagis usage by patients eligible for medicaid grew over the prior year 
contributing to the strong growth in international sales during was the timing of a contractual shift in may to a higher proportion of the per unit sales price recognized upon delivery of product to abbott under the terms of our international distribution agreement 
units shipped to abbott during decreased approximately from  which we believe reflects reductions in abbott s inventory stocking levels rather than reduced product demand by end users 
we believe  based on information provided by ai  that end user demand increased from to cytogam cytogam sales decreased from million in to million in domestic sales units decreased  which was partially offset by a domestic price increase of effective in the second quarter of and a decrease in government reimbursements for the product 
we believe that a portion of the cytogam sales that occurred in was the result of product substitution occurring because of the then worldwide shortage of standard ivig products 
in late  the supply of standard ivig products increased  and certain medicaid agencies began to limit or discontinue reimbursement of cytogam as a substitute for ivig 
thus  cytogam sales relating to product substitution decreased significantly in ethyol ethyol revenues decreased from million in to million in sales of ethyol in were impacted by our early assumption of domestic marketing responsibility for ethyol from alza 
the transfer of marketing responsibility from alza was originally scheduled to occur in april however  in september  we reached an agreement with alza to accelerate to october  the transfer to us of ethyol marketing rights 
in anticipation of that transfer  we ceased supply sales of ethyol to alza during the third quarter of  and we purchased alza s remaining ethyol inventory at historical cost as of september   which we recorded as a reduction to product sales in the amount of million 
beginning october   we recorded all revenues from domestic sales of ethyol and  beginning april   we pay alza a declining royalty for nine years thereafter based on sales of ethyol in the us we recorded net domestic product sales of ethyol of million during the fourth quarter of prior to october   we recorded ethyol domestic product sales based on a price of to of alza s net unit selling price 
our international sales of ethyol to our distribution partner  schering  declined slightly to million during as compared to million in  as unit sales decreased 
in accordance with our product supply agreement  we recorded ethyol international product sales based on a percentage of schering s end user sales 
we believe the decrease in international sales was primarily due to reductions in inventory stocking levels at our international distribution partner 
other products sales of other products in  which included sales of neutrexin  respigam  and by products that result from the cytogam manufacturing process  were comparable to sales 
results for the year ended december  also included net sales of hexalen 
we sold this product to mgi pharma in november and  therefore no longer recorded product sales of hexalen  rather  we recognized royalty income and other revenue pursuant to our agreement with mgi pharma 
these amounts were included in other revenues for revenues other revenues other revenues decreased from million in to million in other revenues during both years consisted primarily of revenues under collaborative agreements 
we recognized revenue of million in compared to million in related to upfront and milestone payments under these agreements 
we recognized non refundable fees and milestone payments in connection with research and development and commercialization agreements as the contractual obligations and performance requirements were fulfilled  using the contingency adjusted performance model for revenue recognition 
under this method  the amount of revenue recognized during each period was based the ratio of actual costs incurred relative to the total projected costs 
other revenues also included research funding from gsk for the development of an hpv vaccine 
funding decreased million to million in  as our responsibilities under the collaboration agreement  primarily phase and clinical trials and preparation of clinical material  were nearing completion 
other revenues also included approximately million in and million in from mgi pharma related to the agreement for the sale of our hexalen business 
during  we also entered into an agreement to sell excess production capacity to a third party and recorded million in other revenues under the arrangement 
other revenues in both years also included royalty income from alza in accordance with the terms of the ethyol distribution agreement 
other revenues during also included million related to the license agreement signed with gsk for our streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine technology 
cost of sales cost of sales for increased to million from million in due to increased sales volumes 
gross margins for the year ended december  improved to from for the year ended december  gross margins in were principally improved as a result of a product mix shift to synagis 
synagis has higher margins than medimmune s other products  which is in part attributable to lower manufacturing costs following implementation of an improved manufacturing process at the fmc  which increased fermentation yields 
additionally  margins in were adversely affected by a million charge associated with the write off of certain synagis inventory  as a result of a contamination in the manufacturing process at the fmc  as well as a million charge associated with the write off of by product inventory associated with our plasma production activities 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to a larger number of active clinical trials 
during  we initiated nine new clinical trials and completed patient enrollment in twelve trials 
our clinical trials included a synagis phase study in infants with congenital heart disease  a trial with adults using a liquid formulation of synagis  three phase and one phase human papillomavirus vaccine trials  one phase trial and three phase trials for use of siplizumab in psoriasis patients  two phase trials for our uti vaccine  and two phase and one phase vitaxin trials 
in addition  to accommodate more research and development activity  we expanded our workforce and facilities  resulting in increased wages and occupancy expense 
during  we incurred significant costs related to the development of various products and product candidates 
a summary of our more significant research and development efforts as of december  would include synagis phase  siplizumab phase  uti phase  hpv vaccine phase and vitaxin phase 
the development stage efforts listed above and other research and development projects may never reach clinical trials  achieve success in the clinic  be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval  or be approved for marketing or manufacturing by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
further  we rely on numerous third parties to assist us in various stages of the development process 
should they be unable to meet our needs  we may incur substantial additional costs 
any of such uncertainties  if they should occur  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense increased to million in from million in as a percentage of product sales  sg a expense increased to in from in a portion of this increase is reflective of million in termination fees relating to our agreement with alza for the accelerated acquisition of ethyol marketing rights in the united states 
in addition  we incurred increased salary and related expenses for approximately additional sales representatives and increased marketing expenses for the relaunch of ethyol during the second half of sg a expense also increased due to increased wage and related expenses for our pediatric sales force which was established in mid year  costs for expanded synagis marketing programs  and increased co promotion expense to the ross products division of abbott laboratories for the promotion of synagis in the united states 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in legal expenses from  as several legal matters outstanding in were resolved 
other operating expenses other operating expenses  which reflect manufacturing start up costs  the cost of idle manufacturing capacity and other manufacturing related costs  increased to million in from million in this increase was mainly attributable to a million charge in to record certain plasma inventories at their net realizable value 
the plasma was intended for the start up operations of our manufacturing plant and was not approved for use in the current production process 
interest income and expense we earned interest income of million during compared to million in  reflecting higher cash balances available for investment and a shift in our investment strategy to include investments with longer maturities  partially offset by a decline in interest rates which lowered our portfolio yield 
interest expense was comparable in to taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of 
this compared to tax expense of million recorded for the year ended december   based on an effective tax rate of 
the variation in the effective tax rate for compared to is due to the amount of credits available for research and development activities 
in addition  due to state tax law changes for the year ended december   the value of our state deferred tax assets decreased 
the change in the statutory tax rate required us to reduce our deferred tax assets and accompanying valuation allowance to value them at the new rate  resulting in a million additional charge to tax expense during cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we recorded a non cash charge to earnings of million  net of tax  or on a diluted per share basis  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the implementation of sab the adjustment was applied to the first quarter of as required by the sab and includes amounts recognized as revenue prior to these amounts related to up front payments or milestone payments that we received in prior years under arrangements for which performance obligations related to the up front or milestone payments had been met  but for which we were contractually obligated to perform additional research and development activities or other activities in future periods 
net earnings earnings for the year ended december  were million  compared to earnings for the year ended december  of million  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
net earnings per share for the year ended december  were for basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share were million and million  respectively 
net earnings for the year ended december   which include the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  were million  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share were million and million  respectively 
we do not believe inflation had a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the company s capital requirements have generally been funded from operations  cash and investments on hand  and issuance of common stock 
cash and marketable securities short and long term increased to billion at december  from million at december  this increase is due to the impact of the acquisition  as well as cash generated from operations 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  also  as a result of the acquisition  we have added million in notes with the entire balance due in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the comparable period  primarily as the result of the net earnings for the period excluding the write off of in process research and development and other non cash items and volume related increases in accrued co promotion expenses for synagis and royalties payable 
the company has made million in cash restructuring payments relating to the acquisition 
the remaining restructuring liability of million is expected to be settled by with cash generated from operations 
investing activities cash used for investing activities during was million  as compared to million in cash used for investing activities in included net additions to our investment portfolio of million  offset by million in cash acquired as a result of the acquisition
