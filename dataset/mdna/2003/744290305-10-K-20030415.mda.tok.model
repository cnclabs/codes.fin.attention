while the private placement from general atlantic partners see below was critical in the execution of our plans during  the year culminated in our acquisition of medunite  inc on december  see below 
we believe that the organization created by the acquisition of medunite now positions us as the second largest physician claims clearinghouse in the country  creating the primary open and neutral alternative to the current market leader  provides us the opportunity to leverage the industry s leading real time transaction network  creates synergies in our operations leading to cost savings and increased margins  and brings to us preferred relationships backed by an incentive plan to grow the business

all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect this transaction 
in april  we sold  shares of unregistered common stock at per share in a private placement to four entities affiliated with general atlantic partners  llc gap  a private equity investment fund  resulting in net proceeds to us of  no placement agent was used in this transaction 
in addition  we also agreed to issue a two year warrant for the purchase of  shares of

as a result of the acquisition  we strengthened our presence in the northeast united states  enhanced our ability to provide multiple offerings to the laboratory industry including penetration into the anatomical pathology laboratory market  and reaffirmed our position as the nationwide leader of laboratory communication products and services 
the operations of kencom since may  are included in our operations for in august  we acquired substantially all of the assets of mdip  inc mdip and d b a medical data insurance processing  a privately owned company located in sioux falls  south dakota  for  in cash and acquisition related costs of  our acquisition of mdip provided us with institutional and dental claims processing capabilities

com  a provider of claims processing services  for  cash 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of medunite  inc medunite for  in cash  an aggregate of  principal amount of convertible promissory notes  and  in transaction and exit related costs 
interest on the convertible notes is payable in cash on a quarterly basis 
the convertible promissory notes are payable in full on december  and are convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock if the founders of medunite achieve certain revenue based triggers over the next three and one half year period 
the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes will be registered by us promptly after a stockholder achieves a conversion trigger event 
if and when these notes become convertible  we will record a beneficial conversion charge in our operations to the extent that the fair market value of the common stock is in excess of the conversion price 
the operations of medunite are not included in our results since the acquisition occurred after the close of business on the last day of medunite was founded in november by seven of the nation s leading health insurers aetna  anthem  cigna  health net  inc  oxford health plans  pacificare health systems  and wellpoint health network  and its technology includes one of the industry s largest internet based real time transaction networks  in addition to electronic data interchange edi based processes 
exiting  medunite s legacy claims platform  which was acquired from ndchealth corporation ndc in  was annually processing over million transactions and approximately million real time transactions were being processed by medunite s new state of the art platform 
the acquisition of medunite adds an additional  physicians to our network and provides unique opportunities for cross selling products and services to our existing and new customer base 
in conjunction with the 
table of contents acquisition of medunite  we formed a strategic relationship with ndc for processing claims and real time transactions and now have potential access to over  physicians that utilize ndc s various practice management systems 
unfortunately  medunite had incurred significant losses since its inception and was utilizing cash significantly in excess of amounts it was generating 
as a result  at the time it was acquired by us  there were substantial liabilities and obligations both recorded and unrecorded at december  associated with the business 
subsequent to the our acquisition  medunite s senior management team was terminated along with approximately of the general workforce in an effort to eliminate duplicative positions and control costs 
we have consolidated certain of our facilities with those leased by medunite and are in the process of terminating other facility leases 
other contractual obligations are being cancelled or renegotiated with certain vendors 
additionally  we have attempted to enter into financing agreements with certain major vendors as a means to settling existing liabilities 
with continued efforts during the first and second quarters of  we anticipate that we will be able to drive cash flow and operating profits in this business by the end of the year 
additionally  for  the post acquisition goal is to migrate customers from medunite s legacy platform  which is not hipaa compliant  onto proxynet  which is currently being remediated in time for the october hipaa deadline for transaction code sets see section discussing healthcare and privacy related legislation above 
the continued growth of the real time platform will be a significant contributor to our long term success

consolidated net revenues for increased by  or  to  from consolidated net revenues of  for net revenues classified by our reportable segments are as follows electronic healthcare transaction processing laboratory communication solutions   net revenues in our electronic healthcare transaction processing segment increased by primarily due to a increase in the number of electronic clinical and financial healthcare transactions processed through proxynet 
total transactions grew from million transactions in the period to million transactions in core transaction growth is up from the period 
the increase in transaction volume was primarily attributable to internal growth in both claims and statements processed 
additionally  we continued to make progress in our cross selling efforts to our existing customers resulting in an increased of transaction services utilized per directly contracted provider from an estimated in to in a summary of the number of transactions we processed for the periods presented is as follows core transactions encounters total transactions 
table of contents core transactions represent all transactions except for encounters 
encounters are an administrative reporting transaction for payers but do not generate revenue for the provider who must submit them 
accordingly  rather than submitting on a routine basis  most providers choose to periodically catch up on their submissions  creating monthly and quarterly swings in both the number of encounters we process and what percentage of our transaction mix they represent 
since encounters are at a significantly lower price point than claims  these swings make it difficult to easily analyze our quarter over quarter growth in our core business 
in addition  we do not expect our encounter volume to grow on an annual basis  as payers are not expanding the capitated service model that is the foundation of encounters 
therefore  we believe that breaking out encounters shows more clearly our growth in core transactions  which are the growth engine for our electronic healthcare transaction services segment 
we exited the year on an annualized run rate of over million total transactions for proxymed on a stand alone basis 
the acquisition of medunite added another million transactions  therefore  we exited with a combined annualized run rate of almost million total transactions

unfortunately  medunite had incurred significant losses since its inception and was utilizing cash significantly in excess of amounts it was generating primarily due to technical and research and development activities related to their various processing platforms

however  if we need additional capital funding in the future to further our strategic plans  there can be no assurance that any additional funding will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  the terms of the financing may have the effect of significantly diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we believe that if we are not successful in obtaining additional financing for further product development or strategic acquisitions  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions but we believe that any variation in results would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition electronic transaction processing fee revenue is recorded in the period the service is rendered 
certain transaction fee revenue may be subject to revenue sharing per agreements with resellers  vendors or gateway partners and are recorded as gross revenues 
revenue from sales of inventory and manufactured goods is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from certain up front fees is amortized ratably over the expected life of the customer or contract 
revenue from hardware leases  network access and maintenance fees is recognized ratably over the applicable period 

table of contents goodwill we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment 
this adoption resulted in the reduction of approximately  of amortization relating to its existing goodwill each quarter  which would have otherwise been recorded through the first quarter of sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a fair value methodology versus an undiscounted cash flow method required under previous accounting rules 
in accordance with its adoption of fas no 
 we completed its initial impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of and our annual test at december  utilizing various valuation techniques including a market value analysis 
no impairment charges were recorded as a result of these tests 
capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants during the application development stage of our internally used software products are capitalized 
costs of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
application development stage costs generally include software configuration  coding  installation to hardware and testing 
once the project is completed  capitalized costs are amortized over their remaining estimated economic life 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any internal use capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
equity transactions over the past two years we have engaged in various equity transactions 
these transactions were first aimed at providing capital to continue to operate and grow our business and then became a critical step aimed at simplifying our capital structure 
these transactions are complex and require the application of various accounting rules and standards that have resulted in significant cash and non cash charges reflected primarily as deemed dividend charges included our net loss applicable to common shareholders 
bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine the bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required
