item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
general going concern 
the company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
as more fully described under amendment to credit facility  subsequent to december   the company was in default of certain covenants under its senior and junior credit facility agreements  and its junior credit facility matures on july  the senior and junior credit facility agreements contain certain cross default provisions and provide for acceleration of amounts due as well as other remedies in the event of default 
these circumstances raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   the company s management and its board of directors made the decision to divest of its remaining towing services segment  as well as the operations of the distribution group of the towing and recovery equipment segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets for the towing services segment and the distribution group are considered a disposal group and the assets are no longer being depreciated 
all assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with these assets have been separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the statements of operations and related financial statement disclosures for all prior years have been restated to present the towing services segment and the distribution group as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations 
the analyses contained herein are of continuing operations  as restated  unless otherwise noted 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
a discussion of critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to customers in the normal course of business 
collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
when a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long lived assets and goodwill may not be fully recovered  the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management  or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations 
the estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue  operating costs  interest rates  property and equipment additions  and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 

table of contents upon adoption of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   the company ceased to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
for further detail of the company s impairment review and related write downs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers tax loss carrybacks  reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning and estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company established a deferred tax valuation allowance of million as of december  the allowance reflects the company s recognition that continuing losses from operations and certain liquidity matters associated with the company s credit facility indicate that it is more likely than not that certain future tax benefits will not be realized through future taxable income 
at december   the company recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets from continuing and discontinuing operations totaling approximately million 
revenues 
under the company s accounting policies  sales are recorded when equipment is shipped to independent distributors or other customers 
while the company manufactures only the bodies of wreckers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties  the company sometimes purchases the truck chassis for resale to its customers 
sales of company purchased truck chassis are included in net sales 
margins are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal 
revenue from company owned distributors is recorded at the time equipment is shipped to customers or services are rendered 
the towing services division recognizes revenue at the time services are performed 
seasonality 
the company s towing and recovery equipment segment has experienced some seasonality in net sales due in part to decisions by purchasers of light duty wreckers to defer wrecker purchases near the end of the chassis model year 
the segment s net sales have historically been seasonally impacted due in part to sales made at the largest towing and recovery equipment trade show which is held in the spring 
change in fiscal year 
on september   the company announced that its board of directors had approved a change in the company s fiscal year  from april to december  effective december  the change to a december fiscal year will enable the company to report results on a conventional calendar basis 
as a result of the change in fiscal year  the company filed a transition report for the eight month period ended december   and the comparative data below compares the financial results for that period against the results for the fiscal year ended april  the periods are not directly comparable  in that they relate to periods of materially different lengths  and also that the transition period does not include results from the three months ended april  a fiscal quarter in which the company s sales have traditionally been seasonally higher than other quarters

as a result of a revised asset appraisal conducted by the senior lenders  the senior lenders determined that the amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility should be lowered below the amount then outstanding under the senior credit facility  causing the company to be over advanced on its line of credit which resulted in the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit facility and a corresponding event of default under the junior credit facility 
the forbearance agreement and subsequent amendments waived the company s overadvance under the senior credit facility and amended the terms of the credit agreement to  among other things  i permanently reduce the commitment levels to million for the towing and recovery equipment segment and million for the roadone segment portion of the revolving credit facility and  for the term loan facility  ii eliminate the company s ability to borrow funds at a libor rate of interest  and iii increase the interest rate to a floating rate of interest equal to the prime rate plus

table of contents on september   the company entered into the third amendment to credit agreement in connection with its senior credit facility 
pursuant to the third amendment  the amount of the mandatory periodic reductions in the roadone revolving loan commitment amount  as established in the april  second amendment to senior credit agreement  were increased by amounts calculated based on updated asset appraisals completed in september consequently  the company will need to repay outstanding loans and permanently reduce the roadone loan commitment under its senior credit facility over the life of the loan and prior to the maturity date 
pursuant to the terms of the second and third amendments  the failure by the company to repay outstanding loans and to reduce the roadone revolving loan commitment by the amounts and the times required pursuant to these amendments will result in increased interest rates on the senior loans and or the occurrence of an event of default under the senior credit agreement 
in addition  pursuant to the third amendment  the amount of availability that can be generated for used inventory considered as eligible inventory for collateral purposes was limited to million subject to downward adjustments upon certain sales of assets and stock by the company and certain of its subsidiaries through february  and reduced to thereafter

the amendment also reduced the level of certain financial covenants for future periods  basing them strictly on the results of the towing and recovery equipment segment for those periods 
in addition  the amendment revised the roadone revolving commitment amount based on the plan to sell all remaining towing service operations  reducing the commitment amount to million at november   million at december   million at january   million at february  and reducing to zero as of march  amendments to credit facility on february   the company entered into the fifth amendment to the senior credit facility 
pursuant to the fifth amendment  the date upon which the amount of certain used inventory taken in trade for collateral purposes is reduced to was extended from february  to march  in addition  the fifth amendment revised the roadone revolving commitment  reducing the amount to million at february  and as of march  
table of contents on april   the company entered into the sixth amendment to the senior credit facility 
the sixth amendment  among other things  revised the roadone revolving commitment  extending by one year the time for the reduction thereof to from march  to march  the amount of availability that can be generated for used inventory considered as eligible inventory for collateral purposes was reduced to million with no further required reductions 
the sixth amendment also extended the time for required delivery of the company s annual financial reports for fiscal year ended december  and certain related items from march  to april  meeting the new repayment schedule for the roadone revolving commitments as described above under amendments to the credit facilities  will require that the company sell its towing services businesses according to its contemplated schedule on acceptable terms 
while the company believes its timetable for sales is achievable there can be no assurance that the schedule can be met 
in addition to the borrowings under the senior and junior credit facilities described above  the company had approximately million of mortgage notes payable  equipment notes payable and other long term obligations at december  the company also had approximately million in noncancellable operating lease obligations  approximately  million of which relates to truck and building leases of discontinued operations 
the company is currently in default under both the senior and junior credit facility as a result of the going concern explanatory paragraph included in the auditors report as well as the failure to file this annual report prior to april  additionally  the company is in default of the ebitda covenant under the junior credit facility only for the first quarter of calendar the company is currently not pursuing a waiver of the default or an amendment to the credit facilities to cure the default 
the company has had informal discussions with its creditors indicating that the creditors will not take action against the company as a result of the default 
however  there can be no assurance that the creditors will not pursue action in the future as a result of this default or any other default under the credit facilities 
failure to achieve the company s revenue and income projections  or to sell towing services operations for the prices and on the timetable contemplated  could result in failure to comply with the amended debt service requirements 
such non compliance would result in an event of default  which if not waived by the lending groups  would result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the senior credit facility as well as other remedies 
under these circumstances the company could be required to find alternative funding sources  such as sale of assets or other financing sources 
if the company were unable to refinance the senior credit facility on acceptable terms or find an alternative source of repayment for the senior credit facility  the company s business and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain any such refinancing or that it would be able to sell assets on terms that are accepted to the company or at all 
if the company is not successful in its efforts to refinance or extend the maturity date of the junior credit facility  the company would likely be required to seek bankruptcy court or other protection from its creditors
