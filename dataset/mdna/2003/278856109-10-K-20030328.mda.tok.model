wilson  serves as co chairman of healthvision 
we are not required to provide funding to healthvision and have made no guarantees on their behalf 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and software development 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sop no  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
our contractual arrangements are evaluated on a contract by contract basis and often require judgment and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed or determinable  whether or not collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services 
we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services including implementation  consulting and software maintenance 
under these arrangements  where vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for arrangements in which vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for each element  including specified upgrades  revenue is deferred and not recognized until delivery of all of the elements without vendor specific objective evidence has occurred 
we enter into long term multiple element arrangements in which we provide our customers with comprehensive technology solutions 
these arrangements typically include multiple software products including the right to future products within the suites purchased  implementation and consulting services  maintenance  and  where desired by the customer  outsourcing and remote hosting services 
these contracts generally provide for monthly or annual payments over the term of the contracts  which typically range from seven to ten years 
we generally recognize revenues under these arrangements on a monthly basis evenly over the term of the contract 
during  we began to enter into arrangements that consist of fees for a multi year  time based software license  hardware and services including implementation  consulting and software maintenance 
the company recognizes the revenue under these arrangements in accordance with sop no 
 including the aicpa software revenue recognition task force technical practice aid 
during the transition to these new contracts  we expect our operating results to reflect lower revenues and cash flows 
however  we believe that these new contracting options will provide for more predictable revenues over the term of the arrangement 
for arrangements bundled with services and maintenance where such services are considered essential to the functionality of the software and provide for payments upon the achievement of implementation milestones  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method  following the guidance in the aicpa statement of position no 
 or sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of labor hours incurred in relation to the total labor hours estimated under the agreement 
determining factors for percentage of completion include the nature of services required and the provision for payments of software and services upon the achievement of implementation milestones 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based upon estimates of the total labor hours to be incurred and revenues to be generated throughout the term of the contract 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and could have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
remote hosting and outsourcing services are marketed under long term arrangements generally over periods of five to ten years 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized as the services are performed 
software support and maintenance fees are marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and are recognized as revenue ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
hardware sales are generally recognized upon delivery to the customer 
deferred revenue consists of payments received for which the revenue has not yet been recognized in accordance with the above revenue recognition policies 
long term deferred revenue  at december   represents amounts received from license fees  maintenance and other services to be earned after december  allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
if circumstances related to specific customers change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date  we perform a detailed assessment of our capitalized software development costs to be marketed which includes a review of  among other factors  projected revenues  customer demand requirements  product lifecycle  changes in software and hardware technologies and product development plans 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect the net realizable value of our capitalized software development costs 
the estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software  the remaining economic life of the software  or both  could change  materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs as well as our consolidated operating results in the period of change 
revenues revenues are derived from the sale of systems and services  which include the licensing of software  software and hardware maintenance  implementation and training  remote hosting  outsourcing  networking services and consulting  and from the sale of computer hardware 
our products and services are generally sold to customers pursuant to contracts that range in duration from three to ten years 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs of systems and services revenues are the amortization of capitalized software development costs  acquired technology and a network services intangible asset 
capitalized software development costs are amortized generally over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related product or based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable product 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset  and the remaining balance will be fully amortized during the network services intangible asset  which was amortized on a straight line basis over three years  became fully depreciated in march cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes only our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs and events  public relations  trade shows  advertising and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead as well as consultants associated with our design  development and testing of new products 
we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of cost of systems and services revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which generally range from three to seven years 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consisted of the value of ongoing customer relationships and goodwill  have been amortized based upon their estimated economic lives at the time of the acquisition  and have therefore varied among acquisitions 
the acquired customer relationships became fully amortized in january of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 our amortization of goodwill ceased as of january   leaving a recorded balance of  of goodwill as of december  at least on an annual basis  we conduct an impairment review of our remaining goodwill balance 
as of december   there was no impairment of the remaining goodwill balance 
restructuring charge during  we initiated and completed a restructuring of our operations 
this restructuring rationalized employee headcount after we completed the integration of our acquisitions 
additionally  we consolidated our research and development and implementation functions 
charges in connection with this restructuring in totaled million 
taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
the carryforwards expire in varying amounts through and are subject to certain restrictions 
based on evidence then available  we did not record a benefit for the resulting net deferred tax asset at december   and  because we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
results of operations compared to total revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in systems and services revenues in was primarily a result of minimal software license fees in the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in license fees was the result of a shortfall in new sales bookings during the third quarter of and the second quarter of  which negatively impacted revenues during the last three quarters of additionally  the decrease was related to a change in contracting mix in the last two quarters of  in which we began to predominantly contract under arrangements that provide for payments to be spread more evenly over the term of the contract  as compared to our historical contracting methods 
since the third quarter of  the majority of our contracts have been executed under these types of arrangements 
as the company continues to contract under these types of arrangements  we expect our operating results to reflect lower revenues and cash flows in the short term 
in addition  we believe that some of our customers and prospects delayed their decisions to purchase our products in anticipation of the initial sunrisexa tm releases in however  we believe that these new contracting options will provide for more predictable revenues over the terms of the arrangements 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  the company began an initiative to expand the sales and marketing functions 
under this initiative the company s sales and marketing team has grown from approximately at december  to more than of at december   including the addition of a new executive vice president responsible for all sales activities and other key management positions 
this program was implemented to increase the market presence of our sales organization and enhance the market awareness of our company and its products and services 
during this expansion  the company s sales and marketing organization experienced considerable change and administrative disruption  which negatively impacted the closing of new contracts during the second quarter of hardware revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in hardware revenues in was primarily due to decreased shipments under contracts entered into in and the lower shipments were primarily attributable to a higher percentage of new contracts being remote hosting and outsourcing as well as the shortfall in bookings during the second quarter of total cost of revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for cost of systems and services revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for however  as a percentage of total revenues  total cost of revenues increased to in  compared to for likewise  cost of systems and services revenues increased to of systems and services revenues in  compared to for these costs decreased primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition related acquired technology and network services assets  which amounted to million for compared to million for  as a result of certain assets becoming fully amortized 
these reductions were partially offset by various other factors including higher software royalties and payroll related costs  in particular medical insurance 
additionally  amortization of capitalized software development costs increased to million in  compared to million for  as a result of certain new products  such as new releases of our sunrise suite  including sunrisexa  becoming available for general release 
furthermore  during we incurred incremental costs of million related to additional obligations arising from contracts assumed in prior acquisitions 
cost of hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for as a percentage of hardware revenues  cost of hardware revenues increased slightly to in  compared to for the decrease in cost of hardware revenues for was directly attributable to the decreased shipments discussed above 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the program we initiated  during the fourth quarter of  to significantly expand the size of our sales and marketing organization 
this program is expected to continue to result in higher expenses 
additionally  there was an increase in expenditures for marketing events held in  as compared to research and development expenses increased million  or to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of total revenues  for the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an initiative we implemented in the fourth quarter of this program accelerates the migration onto the microsoft 
net platform for our sunrisexa products 
this initiative  which increased the number of employees in our product delivery organization  which include research and development  from  as of december   to employees  as of december   is expected to result in continued heightened research and development expenses 
the percentage of research and development expenditures capitalized for the year ended december  was  or million  compared to  or million  for as discussed above  amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included as a component of cost of systems and systems revenues  increased by approximately million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of total revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of higher legal expenses  primarily related to the shareholder litigation  and higher insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the decrease was primarily the result of lower acquisition related amortization  which amounted to million in  compared to million in this decline related to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles  which became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of  as well as the adoption of sfas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
the decrease in amortization was partially offset by higher depreciation of fixed assets purchased during and pooling and transaction costs in related to the completion of the integration of one of our acquisitions for approximately million less than previously estimated 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for this decrease was a result of significantly lower yields  due to lower interest rates  on our cash and cash equivalents in  compared to the effect of the lower interest rates was only partially offset by higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents throughout  compared to cash and cash equivalents increased during primarily from cash generated from operating activities 
as a result of these factors  we had net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net income of million for the year ended december  compared to total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase in systems and services revenues in was primarily attributable to revenues generated under our comprehensive solutions offerings  which we began to offer during the second quarter of  and other new contracted business 
the increase in revenues was also contributed to by improvements we made in our product delivery area  which includes research and development  implementation and customer support 
these functions were consolidated under one management team in to help improve all aspects of the product delivery cycle 
significant investments were made in this area to standardize the development  implementation and ongoing support of our products 
these investments  among other things  helped shorten the product development and implementation cycles while improving quality in each area 
hardware revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase in hardware revenues in was primarily due to increased shipments under contracts entered into in and total cost of revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for cost of systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million  or of systems and services revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of systems and services revenues  for these costs decreased primarily as a result of the realization of integration synergies and the restructurings discussed above  which resulted in lower salaries and payroll related expenses  including medical insurance and travel 
additionally  as mentioned above  we reorganized the implementation organization to improve operating processes and procedures 
in connection with the improvements related to the reorganization  we reduced the usage of outside consultants resulting in lower expenses 
another factor contributing to the decrease was lower amortization of acquisition related acquired technology and network services assets  which amounted to million for  compared to million for these cost savings were partially offset by higher amortization of capitalized software development costs  which amounted to million for  compared to million for additionally  in we recorded an million charge related to the write down of certain receivables assumed in acquisitions from previous years 
cost of hardware revenues increased million  or  to million  or of hardware revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of hardware revenues  for the increase in cost of hardware revenues for was directly attributable to higher hardware revenues and lower margins due to pricing pressure in the hardware sector 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million  for however  as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses declined slightly from to 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for was primarily due to an increase in commissions resulting from an increase in new contracted business as well as the program we initiated  during the fourth quarter of  to significantly expand the size of our sales and marketing organization 
research and development expenses were million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of total revenues  for the decrease in research and development expenses for was due primarily to the realization of integration synergies and the restructuring 
the percentage of research and development expenditures capitalized for was  compared to for as a result of certain products becoming available for general release  amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services revenues  increased by million to million for  compared to million for research and development expenses that were capitalized were million and million for and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  compared to million  or of total revenues  for depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of total revenues  for the increase was primarily the result of depreciation of fixed assets purchased during partially offset by lower amortization of goodwill related to the healthvision acquisition 
the amortization of goodwill related to the healthvision acquisition  which became fully amortized in  amounted to million and million for and  respectively 
pooling and transaction costs decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for during  we completed the integration of one of our acquisitions for approximately million less than previously estimated 
the transaction costs during were primarily the result of costs associated with the abandoned transactions with shared medical systems corp  or sms  and neoforma 
com  inc  or neoforma 
during  the company initiated and completed a restructuring of its operations 
this restructuring rationalized employee headcount following the company s completion of the integration of its prior acquisitions 
additionally  the company consolidated its research and development and implementation functions 
charges in connection with this restructuring totaled million 
other income recorded during the year ended december  related to a realized gain on the sale of our investment in sms of million  which was offset in part by a loss on sale of our investment in equity securities 
interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for this increase was due to significantly higher balances of cash and cash equivalents throughout  while interest rates declined 
cash and cash equivalents increased primarily due to the public offering in january  as well as cash generated from operations 
as a result of these factors  we had net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  public offering during january  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources during  operating activities provided million of cash  primarily as a result of cash collected from customers  partially offset by increased sales and marketing and research and development costs 
investing activities used million of cash  primarily for the purchase of fixed assets and the funding of software development costs 
financing activities provided million of cash  as a result of the exercise of stock options and the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity is our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents 
our future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of growth of our sales and the timing and level of research and development activities 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash generated from our future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the unconditional purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunications services and airplane charters 
the contract for airplane charters is discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements related party transactions included herein 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance in eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas  the board acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas became effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or the issue 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into fiscal years beginning after june  the issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  the issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one earnings process and  if it does  how to divide the arrangement into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified earnings processes for revenue recognition purposes 
the issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
we currently follow the appropriate accounting pronouncement as discussed in our revenue recognition policy note and anticipate that the issue will have no impact on the results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements of sfas  accounting for contingencies  relating to guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with a separately identified premium and guarantees issued without a separately identified premium 
the interpretation s provisions for initial recognition and measurement are required on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that ended after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of this interpretation and it did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we will adopt the remaining provisions on january  and believe that this interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial position  results or operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas sfas provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
these disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure 
the amendments to sfas  which provides for additional methods  are effective for periods beginning after december   although earlier application is permitted 
the amendments to the disclosure requirements are required for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we anticipate that we will adopt the additional disclosure requirements in our interim and annual filings of sfas and will continue to account for stock based compensation under apb no 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
the interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  we will apply the consolidation requirement of the interpretation in future periods if we should own any interest in any variable interest entity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally buy investments with maturities of days or less 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
