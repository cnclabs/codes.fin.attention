item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary factors that may affect future results and forward looking statements this report on form k contains forward looking statements based on cabot s current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about cabot s businesses and the industries in which it operates 
these forward looking statements include statements relating to cabot s expected financial position  business  business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  management s projections and expectations of future profits  the possible achievement of cabot s financial goals and objectives  management s expectations for shareholder value creation initiatives  product development programs  environmental matters and the outcome of legal proceedings 
from time to time  cabot also provides forward looking statements in other materials it releases to the public and in oral statements made by authorized officers 
forward looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as may  should  will  could  estimates  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  plans  expects  future  intends and similar expressions whether in the negative or affirmative 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties  potentially inaccurate assumptions  and other factors  some of which are beyond cabot s control and difficult to predict 
if known or unknown risks materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  cabot s actual results could differ materially from past results and from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
cabot undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures cabot makes on related subjects in its q and k reports filed with the commission 
also note that  as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of  cabot provides the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to cabot s businesses 
these are factors that  individually or in the aggregate  cabot believes could cause its actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results 
it is not possible  however  to predict or identify all such factors 
accordingly  investors should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
demand for cabot s products on a worldwide basis could affect cabot s future performance 
the company s key customers in mature carbon black markets such as north america and europe continue to shift their manufacturing capacity from those regions to developing regions such as china  south america and eastern europe 
although the company is responding to meet these market demand conditions  there is no assurance that the company will be successful 
similarly  demand for cabot s customers products and cabot s competitors reactions to market conditions could affect the company s results 
cabot s chemical business is sensitive to industry capacity utilization 
as a result  pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry in which cabot s chemical business operates  which could affect the company s financial performance 
the company s success in strengthening relationships and growing business with its largest customers and retaining their business over extended time periods could affect the company s future results 
five major tire and rubber customers  one silicone customer  three capacitor materials customers and one microelectronics customer represent a material portion of cabot s total net sales and operating revenues 
in fiscal year  sales to goodyear tire and rubber company by cabot s chemical business amounted to of cabot s consolidated revenues 
the loss of one of these customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced 
in addition  any deterioration of the financial condition of any of the company s customers that impairs their ability to make payments to the company could affect the company s future results and financial condition 
a material portion of the company s sales are made to customers under long term contracts 
the loss of any of these customer contracts could increase the volatility of the company s business results 

table of contents the cost  availability and quality of raw materials affect the company s results 
dramatic increases in such costs or decreases in the availability of raw materials could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
for example  if proposed environmental regulations applicable to the european carbon black industry that call for a reduction in the annual average sulfur content in carbon black feedstock are adopted  the company may experience some difficulty obtaining low sulfur feedstock at an acceptable cost for its european operations 
cabot has manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world  with approximately of its revenues attributable to sales outside the united states 
cabot is thus exposed to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political or country risks inherent in doing business in some countries 
the political risks may include actions of governments especially newly appointed governments  importing and exporting issues  contract loss and asset abandonment 
in particular  the company s business could be affected by political uncertainty within the asia pacific and latin american regions 
the company considers these currency and political risks carefully in connection with its investment and operations activities 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note v of the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information about foreign currency risk 
the risk management discussion included under item a and estimated amounts generated from the analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments in the global financial markets 
the methods used by cabot to assess and mitigate risks should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
cabot has undertaken and will continue to undertake cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or that the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
the company s strategic focus is on optimizing its core businesses and investing the cash and intellectual resources they generate in developing new businesses 
there can be no assurance that the investments in these new businesses will result in a proportional increase in revenues 
in addition  the timely commercialization of products under development by cabot  which may be disrupted or delayed by technical difficulties  market acceptance  competitors new products  as well as difficulties in moving from experimental scale to commercial scale  could affect cabot s future results 
cabot s facilities and businesses are subject to complex safety  health and environmental requirements 
cabot spends  and will continue to spend  significant amounts to comply with such requirements  which could adversely affect cabot s profitability 
as more fully described in item safety  health and environment  cabot has been named as a potentially responsible party under the us superfund law and comparable state statutes with respect to several sites 
during the next several years  as remediation of various environmental sites is carried out  cabot expects to spend a significant portion of its environmental reserve for costs associated with such remediation 
cabot anticipates that the expenditures at these superfund sites will be made over a number of years  and will not be concentrated in any one year 
however  cabot may also incur future costs relating to sites that are not currently known to it or as to which it is currently not possible to make an estimate 
as described in item safety  health and environment  since the mid s  various state  federal and foreign agencies have taken actions to address concerns that carbon black might be carcinogenic 
the company expects the international agency for research on cancer iarc to review the classification of carbon black regarding carcinogenicity over the next two years  and as a result  it is possible that iarc could change the classification of carbon black from possible human carcinogen to probable human carcinogen 
in the event iarc does change the classification of carbon black to probable human carcinogen group a  additional labeling and other hazard communication requirements would be imposed on the company 
in addition  there could be other consequences 
table of contents resulting from a change in iarc s classification of carbon black to group a which could have a material adverse effect on the company s carbon black business 
as more fully described in item legal proceedings  the company is a party to or the subject of lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including those involving contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters as well as product liability and personal injury claims relating to asbestosis  silicosis and berylliosis 
adverse rulings  judgments or settlements in pending or future litigation including carbon black antitrust claims and liabilities associated with respirator claims or the outcome of pending governmental investigations including investigations of the carbon black industry by european antitrust authorities could cause the company s results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any forward looking statements 
the company owns and is a licensee of various patents covering many of its products  as well as processes and product uses 
nonetheless  there is no assurance that the company will not be subject to claims that its products  processes or product uses infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
these claims  even if they are without merit  could be expensive and time consuming to defend and if the company were to lose such claims  it could be subject to injunctions or damages or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition to the factors described above  the following other factors  among others  could affect cabot s future performance and cause its actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward looking statements changes in the rate of economic growth in the united states and other major international economies  changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies throughout the world  fluctuations in interest rates  stock market conditions  acts of war and terrorist activities  and the impact of global health and safety concerns on economic conditions and market opportunities 
i 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that are central to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make estimates about matters that are highly uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its policies and estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company primarily derives its revenue from the sale of specialty chemicals  tantalum and related products and cesium formate 
other operating revenues include tolling  services and royalties received for licensed technology 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which establishes the criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue from product sales is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the company generally is able to ensure that products meet customer specification prior to shipment 
under certain multi year supply contracts with declining prices and minimum volumes  cabot recognizes revenue based on an estimated average selling price over the contract lives 
the company prepares its estimates for sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
the company offers its customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and 
table of contents rebates are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
rebates that are earned over a period of time are recorded based on the estimated amount to be earned  which is reviewed periodically 
a provision for sales returns and allowances is recorded at the time of sale based on historical experience as a reduction of sales 
if actual future results vary  the company may need to adjust its estimates  which could have a material impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which could materially affect future earnings 
as of september   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process  and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
had the company used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million higher as of september  the cost of other us and all us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in cases where the market value of inventories is below cost  the inventory is stated at market value 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such write downs have not historically been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset  excluding goodwill  is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows 
the company s estimates reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
in circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded when cabot abandons the asset 
the company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard fas no 
the fair value of the assets including goodwill balances is based on discounted estimated cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management s best estimates of future growth rates  capital expenditures  discount rates  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill is recorded 
environmental costs the company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single liability amount cannot be reasonably estimated  but a range can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues the amount that reflects its best estimate within that range or the low end of the range if no estimate within the range is better 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters is recognized on a discounted basis 
the availability of new information  
table of contents changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in applicable government laws and regulations could result in higher or lower costs 
the company does not reduce its estimated liability for possible recoveries from insurance carriers 
proceeds from insurance carriers are recorded when realized by the receipt of cash or a contractual agreement 
as of september   the company had million reserved for various environmental matters 
pensions and other postretirement benefits the company maintains both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its employees 
in addition  the company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions concerning the general economic conditions  including interest rates  expected return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increases for employees 
projected health care benefits reflect the company s assumptions about health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
litigation and contingencies the company accrues a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on the company s best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if the company is unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes in each jurisdiction that imposes a tax on its income 
this process involves estimating the tax exposure for differences between actual results and estimated results 
the company has filed its tax returns in accordance with its interpretation of each jurisdiction s tax laws and has established reserves for potential differences in interpretation of those laws 
in the event that actual results are significantly different from these estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be significantly impacted 
ii 
results of operations cabot corporation and its subsidiaries the company or cabot are organized into three reportable segments the chemical business  supermetals csm  and specialty fluids csf 
the chemical business is primarily comprised of the carbon black  fumed metal oxides  inkjet colorants  and aerogels product lines 
the following discussion of results includes diluted earnings per share  segment sales  and segment operating profit before taxes pbt 
segment pbt is used by cabot to measure the company s consolidated operating results and assess segment performance 
the following discussion has been prepared on a basis consistent with segment reporting as outlined in note w of the consolidated financial statements 
refer to note w of the consolidated financial statements for a definition of segment pbt and additional segment information 
the following analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with cabot s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to cabot s fiscal years ended september 
table of contents net sales and operating profit before taxes by segment are shown in note w of the consolidated financial statements 
overview cabot reported diluted earnings per share of   and in   and  respectively 
for  the amount included per diluted share for certain items and discontinued operations  as detailed in the company summary section that follows  compared to the amount  which included per diluted share for certain items and discontinued operations in for  in earnings included per diluted share for certain items and discontinued operations 
charges from certain items are detailed in the company summary section below 
the chemical business operated in a difficult environment throughout raw material costs remained high and low industry capacity utilization levels resulted in decreased margins compared to due to competitive price pressure in the non contracted business 
slightly higher volumes  positive currency translations to us dollars  and lower inventory costs partly offset the impact of lower margins 
supermetals volumes were higher than due to the resolution of customer contract disputes 
csm average prices were flat as improved product mix was offset by reduced prices in asia and lower contract prices 
improved manufacturing utilization positively impacted results in csm 
cabot specialty fluids sales decreased compared to due to lower north sea drilling activity 
in  weak economic conditions persisted through much of the year  resulting in flat volumes  lower pricing  and compressed margins in the chemical business compared to the chemical business received some benefit from decreased feedstock costs and positive currency translations 
in total  however  pricing declines exceeded raw material cost reductions 
as a result of contract disagreements with certain tantalum customers  csm experienced lower volumes compared to these negative impacts were offset by improved contract related pricing and reduced tantalum ore costs 
csf continued to gain market acceptance and experienced slightly higher volumes and increased pricing 
cabot s sales for  and were  million   million and  million  respectively 
in  increased pricing for the contracted portion of the carbon black business  increased volumes for csm  and favorable foreign exchange rates contributed to a million increase in sales 
in  decreased pricing for the carbon black business and decreased volumes in csm resulted in a million sales decline from percentage of total sales segment sales chemical business supermetals specialty fluids sales by geographic region north america europe south america asia pacific 
table of contents continuing operations chemical business carbon black  fumed metal oxides  inkjet colorants  and aerogels segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions sales for the chemical business were  million in  compared with  million in and  million in in  sales increased  primarily as a result of increased pricing on long term carbon black contract business due to higher raw material costs  as well as positive currency translation  and slightly higher volumes over segment pbt decreased  from million in to million in  primarily due to million of lower operating margins 
the lower margins were due to a combination of rising raw material costs million and the company s inability to increase prices in the non contract business during this period of low industry capacity utilization 
in addition  the chemical business pbt declined due to an million increase in aerogel costs associated with refining the manufacturing process and developing commercial markets for this emerging business 
these declines were partially offset by favorable foreign exchange million and lower inventory costs million 
in  sales decreased compared to  primarily as a result of lower pricing on flat volume 
segment pbt decreased  from million in to million in  largely as the result of reduced pricing on contract business  which was more than the benefit from lower raw material costs 
carbon black sales  which comprise the majority of the sales in the chemical business segment  improved from due to contract related price increases and positive currency translation 
globally  carbon black volumes increased slightly 
volumes decreased in north america and europe  but improved in asia pacific and south america due to a combination of regional specific growth and tire capacity migrating to these lower cost regions 
strengthened demand in asia pacific  particularly in china  resulted in a improvement in volumes for the region 
carbon black pbt decreased by compared to  due primarily to lower unit margins as price increases were insufficient to offset higher feedstock costs 
lower inventory costs and positive currency translation  primarily from the strengthening euro  partially offset the impact of the margin decline 
in  the fumed metal oxides business experienced an overall volume increase with improvement in all market sectors 
lower feedstock  administrative and inventory costs more than offset lower prices in the niche markets and an unfavorable regional sales mix 
the profitability of the fumed metal oxide business increased from the inkjet colorants business continues to gain market acceptance with oem and after market customers 
sales revenue increased from due to an increase in the installed base of printers using pigment technology as well as higher acceptance of non oem branded cartridges 
the positive revenues were partly offset by higher research and development costs associated with the pursuit of new oem platforms and the advancement of color pigment technology 
in  the aerogels business increased its spending by million to refine the unique manufacturing process at its semi works facility and continue to develop commercial markets 
during the year  the business completed four commercial translucent panel projects 
outlook for the company remains cautious regarding the business outlook for the chemical business 
the uncertainty is based on downward pricing pressure due to competition in the non contracted business combined with increasing raw material costs which make it difficult to maintain margin levels 
carbon black continues to have low industry capacity utilization and increasing migration of tire customers to lower cost regions  which has led to the closure of cabot s carbon black plant in zierbena  spain and a carbon black 
table of contents production line in west virginia 
it is unclear whether carbon black margins will improve as the economy recovers and as the migration of tire manufacturing continues to low cost regions 
in addition  by july  the chemical business may incur additional expenditures of as much as million for capital improvements of its carbon black facilities located in the united states that will be required in order to reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants as required by the epa s final rule amending the generic maximum achievable control technology standards 
the company will diligently manage its cost structure and capacity in an effort to mitigate the impact of these issues 
carbon black is expected to obtain fixed cost savings through leveraged purchasing  shared services and the closure of the zierbena  spain plant 
fumed metal oxides is expected to improve as volumes increase with the economic recovery and the business focuses on reducing costs  which could be offset by strong competition in the niche markets 
the inkjet business should continue to expand oem and aftermarket sales  which will be offset by increased research and development costs 
supermetals business segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions supermetals sales were million in  compared with million in and million in segment pbt for csm was positively impacted in by the resolution of contract disputes relating to tantalum supply and strong intermediate product sales 
the resolution of the tantalum supply contract disputes stabilized the business and contributed to a increase in powder volumes in compared to improved csm manufacturing utilization and lower research and development costs contributed significantly to the higher results 
as a result of recognizing revenue under certain contracts on an estimated average selling price basis over the lives of the contracts  the company deferred million of revenue and profit in fiscal to future periods extending through a legal dispute continues with one customer  avx corporation avx  in connection with its tantalum supply agreement 
however  avx continues to purchase product in accordance with the terms of its contract 
outlook for the supermetals business pbt is expected to decline to a level below million primarily due to the expiration of contracted obligations for the sale of intermediate products 
the outlook for the electronics industry is still uncertain  but the company believes that inventory in the supply chain is approaching normal levels 
csm believes it is well positioned for a long term turnaround in the electronics sector due to its tantalum ore supply contracts and the available capacity at its two manufacturing facilities 
specialty fluids business segment sales segment pbt dollars in millions specialty fluids sales in were million versus million in and million in the decline in sales from to was due to a slowdown in drilling activity in the north sea and the revenue associated with the jobs completed  which resulted in an operating loss for the year 
improvements in cesium formate production costs partly offset the impact of the lower volumes 
since csf s formation  cesium formate has been successfully used in oil and gas well completions and drill in applications 

table of contents outlook for specialty fluids is expected to improve as a result of the company s supply arrangement for two large gas and condensate field projects being developed by statoil  which the company believes should lead to the use of cabot s fluids in a significant number of those drilling and completion projects over the next several years 
the outlook for increased drilling activity in the north sea is still uncertain  however  the company is actively pursuing business in other regions to expand its geographical presence 
company summary income from continuing operations income from continuing operations before income taxes was million in  a decline from million in in  income from continuing operations before income taxes was million 
results in included million of pre tax charges for certain items  detailed in the table below  compared with million in and million in results in were negatively impacted by lower operating margins in the chemical business and the certain items noted below 
however  the lower results were partly offset by higher volumes in the supermetals and chemical businesses  favorable currency translation to us dollars  and lower inventory costs

fiscal year dollars in millions certain items represented in the various lines of the consolidated statements of income cost of sales selling and administrative expenses research and technical service other income expense certain items before income taxes 
table of contents gross profit declined by million in due to a decrease in margins in the chemical business and million of certain items included in cost of sales  mostly due to restructuring costs related to the closure of the zierbena  spain carbon black plant  the consolidation of administrative services for the european businesses in one shared service center and a reduction in workforce in north america 
these declines were partly offset by higher tantalum powder volumes and improved manufacturing utilization in csm 
the chemical business benefited from slightly higher volumes  lower inventory costs  and positive currency translation  primarily due to the strength of the euro versus the dollar 
in  gross profit declined by million from due to weaker margins in the chemical business and lower volumes in csm 
fiscal results were partially offset by improved pricing and lower raw material costs in csm and  to a lesser degree  positive foreign exchange translations 
operating expenses include research and technical expense and selling and administrative expenses 
research and technical spending increased million in versus primarily due to the purchase of assets of superior micropowders 
approximately million of the purchase price of million represents the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development and was immediately expensed and recorded in research and technical expense 
selling and administrative expenses for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the million increase in is due to the inclusion of million of certain items related to european and north american restructuring and respirator charges partly offset by insurance recoveries as compared to million of certain items in in  selling and administrative expenses increased million compared to  primarily due to the consolidation of cabot supermetals japan csj selling and administration costs following the acquisition of that joint venture 
interest and dividend income was million less than  primarily due to a decrease in cabot s average cash position and the negative impact of lower interest rates 
interest expense of million in was equal to as lower interest rates on variable rate debt were offset by foreign exchange impacts of a weaker us dollar 
in  interest expense was million lower than due to the benefit of lower interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and the retirement of high coupon debt 
in  other income and charges was million higher than due to the sale of the company s equity interest in aearo corporation for million included in certain items 
this income was partially offset by the write down of investments in sons of gwalia and angus ross for million included in certain items and costs associated with the refinancing of debt

the reduction in the effective tax rate from to was principally related to an increase in the benefits from the extraterritorial income exclusion 
the company expects its effective tax rate for fiscal to be in a range between and 
cabot s share of earnings from equity affiliates of million  in  was equal to the prior year 
in  earnings from equity affiliates decreased to million from million in this decline resulted from the purchase of the remaining interest in csj on february   which caused the results to be consolidated in the company s income statement from that date forward

all other long term debt is denominated in us dollars 
the repayment schedule above does not include the effect of swaps 
the weighted average interest rate related to the long term debt is

as of september   cabot was in compliance with all of its covenants 
at september   the company had provided standby letters of credit totaling million  which expire in fiscal a downgrade of one level in the company s credit rating is not anticipated  but should it occur  it would not cause a significant impact on the commitments or sources of capital described above and would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in may  cabot initiated a european restructuring plan to reduce costs  enhance customer service and create a stronger and more competitive organization

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk cabot s principal financial risk management objective is to identify and monitor its exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates in order to assess the impact that changes in each could have on future cash flow and earnings 
cabot manages these risks through normal operating and financial activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments as well as foreign currency debt 
cabot s financial risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
cabot s financial risk management committee is charged with enforcing the financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  cabot is subject to credit and market risk 
if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  cabot s credit risk will equal the fair value gain on the derivative
