item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the recognition of income and expenses  impairment of assets  estimates of future improvement costs  capitalization of costs  provision for litigation  insurance and warranty claims and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of toll brothers  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in to owned partnerships and affiliates are accounted for on the equity method 
investments in less than owned entiites are accounted for on the cost method 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in addition to direct acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventories during the period beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
it takes approximately four to five years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in one of our typical communities 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to years to complete 
since our inventory is considered a long lived asset under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to review the carrying value of each of our communities and writedown the value of those communities for which we believe the values are not recoverable 
when the profitability of a current community deteriorates or the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  we evaluate the property in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
if this evaluation indicates an impairment loss should be recognized  we charge cost of sales for the estimated impairment loss in the period determined 
in addition  we review all the land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or under contract  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land 
based upon this review  we decide a as to land that is under a purchase contract but not owned  whether the contract will be terminated or renegotiated  and b as to land we own  whether the land can be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine which costs that have been capitalized to the property are recoverable and which costs should be written off 
income recognition revenue and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home  or lot  is closed and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
land  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes to the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
the estimated land  common area development and related costs of master planned communities including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any change in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining lots in each of the communities of the master planned community 
joint venture accounting we have investments in three joint ventures with independent third parties to develop and sell land that was owned or currently is owned by our venture partners 
we recognize our share of earnings from the sale of lots to other builders 
we do not recognize earnings from lots we purchase  but instead reduce our cost basis in these lots by our share of the earnings on those lot sales 
we have agreed to purchase lots from one of the ventures and have the right to purchase up to lots from the second 
the third venture has sold all the land that it owned and is currently in the process of completing the final land improvements which could take months or more to finish 
the joint ventures also participate in the profits earned on home sales from the lots sold to other builders above certain agreed upon levels 
at october   we had approximately million invested in these joint ventures and were committed to contribute additional capital of approximately million if the joint ventures require it 
in addition  we effectively own one third of toll brothers realty trust group the trust  which was formed with a number of our senior executives and directors and with the pennsylvania state employees retirement system to take advantage of commercial real estate opportunities that may present themselves from time to time 
we provide development  finance and management services to the trust and receive fees under various agreements 
at october   our investment in the trust was million 
we also entered into a subscription agreement whereby each group of investors agreed to invest an additional million if required by the trust 
the original subscription agreement  which was to expire in june  was extended to august the trust currently owns and operates several office buildings and an apartment complex  a portion of which is rented and a portion of which remains under construction 
we also own of a joint venture with an unrelated third party that is currently selling and building an active adult  age qualified community 
at october   our investment was million in this joint venture 
we do not have any further commitment to contribute additional capital to this joint venture 
we do not currently guarantee any indebtedness of the joint ventures or the trust 
our total commitment to these entities is not material to our financial condition 
these investments are accounted for on the equity method

amounts may not add due to rounding 
fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal were higher than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
the revenue increase was attributable to a increase in the number of homes delivered and a increase in the average price of the homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered in fiscal was principally the result of increased base selling prices and an increase in the average value of options and lot premiums that our buyers paid 
in fiscal  our buyers paid approximately above the base selling price for options and lot premiums 
the slight increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal was due primarily to the small increase in the number of delivering communities and a slight decline in the number of homes delivered per community 
we have encountered and continue to encounter delays in the opening of new communities and new sections of existing communities due to increased governmental regulation in many of the markets in which we operate 
these delays resulted in a decline in the number of selling communities we had in the later part of fiscal  which did not reverse until the middle of fiscal in addition  it often takes more than nine months from the signing of an agreement of sale to the delivery of a home to a buyer 
because of the delays in the opening of new communities in fiscal and and the long period of time before a new community can start delivering homes once it opens for sale  the increase in the average number of communities delivering homes in fiscal compared to fiscal was slight 
the number of homes delivered per community in fiscal declined slightly compared to fiscal this decline was primarily due to the decline in backlog at october  as compared to october  and a softness in new contract signings that we encountered in the first portion of the first quarter of fiscal the decline in backlog at october  and the softness in the first part of the first quarter of fiscal were due primarily to the slowing economy exacerbated by the tragic events of september the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes in fiscal  a increase over the billion  homes signed in fiscal this increase is attributable to a increase in the number of homes sold and an increase in the average selling price of the homes due primarily to the location and size of homes sold and increases in base selling prices 
the increase in the number of homes sold is attributable to an increase in the number of communities from which we were selling and the continued demand for our homes 
at october   we were selling from communities compared to communities at october  we believe that the demand for our homes is attributable to an increase in the number of affluent households  the maturation of the baby boom generation  a constricted supply of available new home sites  attractive mortgage rates and the belief on the part of potential customers that the purchase of a home is a stable investment in the current period of economic uncertainty 
at october   we had over  home sites under our control nationwide in markets we consider to be affluent 
at october   our backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  higher than the billion  homes backlog at october  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of new contracts signed and the increased prices of the homes sold during fiscal as previously discussed 
based on the size of our current backlog  the continued demand for our homes  the increased number of selling communities from which we are operating and the additional communities we expect to open in the early part of fiscal  we believe that we will deliver approximately  homes in fiscal and the average delivered price of those homes will be between  and  home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than costs  lower land and improvement costs  improved operating efficiencies and lower inventory writedowns  offset in part by the cost of increased sales incentives provided to customers in the later part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal these incentives were used to help increase new contract signings which were adversely affected by the economic slowdown in the later part of fiscal and the effect the tragic events of september  had on new orders 
we incurred million in write offs in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we expect that home costs will increase slightly as a percentage of home sales revenues due primarily to geographic and product mix changes 
land sales we are developing several master planned communities in which we sell land to other builders 
the amount of land sales will vary from year to year depending upon the scheduled timing of the delivery of the land parcels 
land sales amounted to million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal in fiscal  land sales are expected to amount to approximately million 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures we are a party to several joint ventures and in toll brothers realty trust group the trust 
we recognize income for our proportionate share of the earnings from these entities 
see critical accounting policies joint venture accounting for a narrative of our investment in and commitments to these entities 
in fiscal and  only two of the joint ventures were operating 
we recognized million of earnings from these entities in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in earnings was caused by the reduction in the number of lots delivered by one of the joint ventures in fiscal compared to fiscal the reduction in fiscal was the result of fewer lots being available for sale by the joint venture due to the delivery of the last lots owned by it 
earnings from joint ventures will vary significantly from year to year depending on the level of activity of the entities 
for fiscal  we expect to realize approximately million of income from our investments in the joint ventures and the trust 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was principally due to a decrease in interest income  a decrease in earnings from our ancillary businesses and a non recurring gain in the fiscal from the sale of an office building constructed by us  offset  in part  by increased income from retained customer deposits 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending increased by million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the increased spending was principally due to the costs incurred by the greater number of selling communities that we had during fiscal as compared to fiscal  costs associated with the continued expansion of the number of new communities and increased insurance costs  offset  in part  by the discontinuance of amortization of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards board no 
in november we expect to open approximately communities in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  we expect sg a will increase slightly as a percentage of total revenues compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal home sales home sales revenues for fiscal were higher than those for fiscal by approximately million  or 
the revenue increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the average price of the homes delivered and a increase in the number of homes delivered 
the increase in the average price of the homes delivered was the result of increases in selling prices  a shift in the location of homes delivered to more expensive areas and an increase in the dollar amount of options that our home buyers selected 
during fiscal  our homebuyers paid approximately above the base selling price of a home for options and lot premiums  compared to in fiscal the increase in the number of homes delivered was primarily due to the larger backlog of homes to be delivered at the beginning of fiscal as compared to fiscal the value of new sales contracts signed was billion  homes and billion  homes for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the value of new contracts signed in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in the average selling price of the homes due primarily to an increase in base selling prices  a shift in the location of homes sold to more expensive areas and an increase in the dollar amount of options selected by our home buyers  offset  in part  by a decrease in the average number of communities in which we were offering homes for sale and the resulting decrease in the number of homes for which we signed sales contracts 
the decrease in the number of communities was the result of increased regulatory requirements that delayed the opening of some new communities and new sections of some existing communities 
at october   the backlog of homes under contract was billion  homes  as compared to the billion  homes backlog at october the terrorist attacks of september  impacted us most severely in the first few weeks immediately after the events as consumer confidence dropped  the stock market declined and our business slowed 
in the six week period following october   the total number of deposits was approximately higher than the same period of fiscal on a per community basis  deposits were down approximately over the same period 
compared to the previous five year average for the six week period  deposits were approximately higher on a per community basis 
home costs as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was largely the result of selling prices increasing at a greater rate than costs  lower land and improvement costs  and improved operating efficiencies  offset  in part  by higher inventory writedowns 
we incurred million in write offs in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal land sales in fiscal  we operated a land development and sales operation in our south riding master planned community located in loudoun county  virginia 
land sales amounted to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in land sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to fewer lots being available for sale in south riding in fiscal than in  offset  in part  by increased sales of lots from several of our other master planned communities 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures in fiscal  we entered into a joint venture to develop and sell land owned by our venture partner 
under the terms of the agreement  we have the right to purchase up to a specified number of lots with the majority of the lots to be sold to other builders 
in fiscal  the joint venture sold its first group of home sites to other builders and to us 
we recognize our share of earnings from the sale of lots to other builders 
we do not recognize earnings from lots we purchase  instead  we reduce our cost basis in these lots by our share of the earnings of the joint venture from the sale of these lots 
interest and other income interest and other income increased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase in interest income  the gain from the sale of an office building constructed by us in fiscal  and an increase in earnings from our ancillary businesses  offset in part by reduced management fee income and gains from the sale of miscellaneous assets recognized in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a spending increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increased spending was primarily due to the increase in home revenues in fiscal over fiscal  and costs related to the development of our master planned communities 
sg a as a percentage of total revenues was the same in fiscal and fiscal interest expense we determine interest expense on a specific lot by lot basis for our homebuilding operations and on a parcel by parcel basis for land sales 
as a percentage of total revenues  interest expense varies depending on many factors including the period of time that we owned the land  the length of time that the homes delivered during the period were under construction  and the interest rates and the amount of debt carried by us in proportion to the amount of our inventory during those periods 
interest expense as a percentage of revenues was slightly higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal and was slightly higher in fiscal than fiscal income before income taxes income before income taxes increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes income taxes for fiscal  and were provided at effective rates of  and  respectively 
capital resources and liquidity funding for our operations has been provided principally by cash flow from operations  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt markets 
cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  has improved as operating results have improved 
one of the main factors that determines cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  is the level of revenues from the delivery of homes and land sales 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  will continue to be strong 
we have used our cash flow from operations  before inventory additions  bank borrowings and public debt to acquire additional land for new communities  fund additional expenditures for land development  fund construction costs needed to meet the requirements of our increased backlog and the increasing number of communities in which we are offering homes for sale  repurchase our stock  and repay debt 
we expect that our inventory will continue to increase and we are currently negotiating and searching for additional opportunities to obtain control of land for future communities 
at october   we had commitments to acquire land of approximately million  of which approximately million had been paid or deposited 
at october   we had a million unsecured revolving credit facility with banks  of which million extends to february and million extends to march at october   we had no borrowings against the facility and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
in november  we issued million of senior notes 
we intend to use the proceeds to repay all of the million outstanding of our senior subordinated notes due  repay bank debt and for general corporate purposes 
we called for redemption all of the million outstanding senior subordinated notes effective december  at a price of of the principal amount 
we will recognize a pretax charge of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal representing the premium paid on redemption and the write off of unamortized bond issuance costs 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our activities through a combination of existing cash resources  cash flow from operations and existing sources of credit  including the public debt markets 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead  as well as in increased sales prices 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes may affect our profits 
since the sales prices of homes are fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home and we generally contract to sell a home before commencement of construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest costs  as well as in housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
the table below sets forth  as of october   our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt fiscal weighted weighted year of average average expected interest interest maturity amount rate amount rate thereafter   total   fair value at october    we have a million revolving credit facility with banks of which million extends through march and million extends through february interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at this rate will vary based upon our corporate debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
we had no borrowings against this facility at october  one of our subsidiaries has a million line of credit with a bank to fund mortgage originations 
the line is due within days of demand by the bank and bears interest at the bank s overnight rate plus an agreed upon margin 
at october  the subsidiary had million outstanding under the line at an average interest rate of 
borrowing under this line is included in the fiscal year maturities 
in november  we issued million of senior notes due we will use a portion of the proceeds from the notes to redeem all of the million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due we expect to complete this redemption on december  the notes are included in the fiscal maturities 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately  per year
