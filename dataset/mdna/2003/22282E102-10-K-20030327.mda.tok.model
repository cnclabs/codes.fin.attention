the gmsv companies are global materials services venezuela ca  gms venezuela terminal partners llc and gms venezuela terminal holdings llc 
dhc  through its ownership of acl and gms  has a ownership interest in gmsv 
also in in connection with the acl acquisition  dhc purchased for approximately million a equity interest in vessel leasing  a special purpose entity that leases barges to acl s barge transportation operations 
dhc also indirectly owns the other equity interest in vessel leasing through acl  and  accordingly  vessel leasing is consolidated with dhc and with acl 
dhc holds all of the voting stock of danielson indemnity company dind 
dind owns percent of the common stock of national american insurance company of california  danielson s principal operating insurance subsidiary  which owns percent of the common stock of valor insurance company  incorporated valor  danielson insurance company and danielson national insurance company dind  national american insurance company of california and its subsidiaries being collectively referred to hereinafter as naicc 
naicc writes non standard private passenger and commercial automobile insurance  primarily in california 
naicc writes approximately of its insurance in california and of its business in montana 
for the years ended december  and   and  respectively  of total personal lines direct written premiums were produced through two general agents of naicc 
prior to  naicc also underwrote workers compensation insurance  but has subsequently exited the workers compensation business in all states 
tax loss carryforward at the close of  dhc had a consolidated net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
this estimate is based upon federal consolidated income tax losses for the periods through december  and an estimate of the taxable results 
some or all of the carryforward may be available to offset  for federal income tax purposes  the future taxable income  if any  of dhc  its wholly owned subsidiaries and the mission trusts described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of dhc s tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the net operating loss carryforward were reported 
the net operating loss carryforward is currently fully reserved  for valuation purposes  on dhc s financial statements 
dhc s net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not used  in the following approximate amounts in the following years dollars in thousands amount of carryforward year expiring dhc s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards would be substantially reduced if dhc were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
dhc will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders 
for this purpose  stock ownership is measured by value  and does not include so called straight preferred stock 
in an effort to reduce the risk of an ownership change  dhc has imposed restrictions on the ability of holders of five percent or more of the dhc common stock  par value 
per share the common stock  as well as the ability of others to become five percent stockholders as a result of transfers of common stock 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and dhc expects that they will remain in force as long as the net operating loss carryforwards are available to dhc 
notwithstanding such transfer restrictions  there could be circumstances under which an issuance by dhc of a significant number of new shares of common stock or other new class of equity security having certain characteristics for example  the right to vote or convert into common stock might result in an ownership change under the internal revenue code 
the marine services business nature of marine services operations acl is an integrated marine transportation and service company  providing barge transportation and ancillary services 
the principal cargoes carried are steel and other bulk commodities  grain  coal and liquids including a variety of chemicals  petroleum and edible oils

acl  through its domestic barging subsidiary american commercial barge line llc acbl  is the leading provider of river barge transportation throughout the inland united states and gulf intracoastal waterway systems  which include the mississippi  illinois  ohio  tennessee and the missouri rivers and their tributaries and the intracoastal canals that parallel the gulf coast collectively  the inland waterways 
in addition  since expanding its barge transportation operations to south america in  acl has become the leading provider of barge transportation services on the orinoco river in venezuela and the parana paraguay river system serving argentina  brazil  paraguay  uruguay and bolivia 
acl s position as a leader in south american barging was expanded on october   when an acl owned subsidiary  acbl hidrovias  ltd 
acblh entered into an agreement with up river holdings ltd 
ultrapetrol to combine the inland river barge transportation divisions of ultrapetrol and acblh 
uabl operates on the parana paraguay river system in south america 
acblh has a ownership interest in the joint venture company  uabl limited uabl 
uabl operates towboats and a combined fleet of dry cargo and tank barges 
uabl serves commodity shippers in argentina  bolivia  brazil  paraguay and uruguay 
at year end  acbl s combined barge fleet was the largest in the united states  consisting of  covered and open barges  used for the transportation of dry cargo  and tank barges used for transportation of liquid cargo 
acbl s barge fleet is supported by the largest towboat fleet in the united states  consisting of towboats at year end 
acbl has a strong and diverse customer base consisting of several of the leading industrial and agricultural companies in the united states 
acbl has numerous long standing customer relationships  with of its top customers having been customers of acbl for over years 
in many cases  these relationships have resulted in multi year contracts 
certain long term contracts provide for minimum tonnage or requirements guarantees  which allow acbl to plan its logistics more effectively 
historically  a majority of acbl s contracts for non grain cargoes are at a fixed price  increasing the stability and predictability of operating revenue 
acl  through its jeffboat subsidiary  designs and manufactures towboats and barges for acbl  other acl subsidiaries and third party customers 
through its american commercial terminals llc act subsidiary  which operates two river terminal sites along the inland waterways  acl supports its barging operations with transfer and warehousing capabilities for coal and liquid commodity products moving between barge  truck and rail

acl international works closely with current and potential customers to establish mutually beneficial long term contracts to serve these needs 
by following this strategy  acl international has become the leading provider of barge transportation on the orinoco river in venezuela and  through uabl  the leading provider of barge transportation on the parana paraguay river system serving argentina  brazil  paraguay  uruguay and bolivia 
through formation of the acbl dominicana sa subsidiary in  acl international also began operations on the higuamo river in the dominican republic 
because demand for transportation in south america is expected to grow and there are several consolidation opportunities in the south american market  acl international has the opportunity to broaden the scope of its operations over the long term 
acl history  dhc acquisition and recapitalization of acl acl is a delaware limited liability company formed in april in connection with the conversion by merger of its predecessor american commercial lines  inc acl inc  a delaware corporation  into a limited liability company 
acl inc was formed in as the holding company for a family of barge transportation and marine service companies with an operating history beginning in in  acl was recapitalized by its owners pursuant to a recapitalization agreement  dated april   among csx corporation csx  vectura group inc  a delaware corporation now vectura group llc vectura  a delaware limited liability company  acl s parent american commercial lines holdings llc acl holdings  a delaware limited liability company  acl and national marine  inc  a delaware corporation now national marine llc national marine  a delaware limited liability company  whereby acl holdings completed a recapitalization in a series of transactions the recapitalization and combined the barging operations of vectura  national marine and their subsidiaries with that of acl 
acl holdings is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of dhc 
to finance the recapitalization  acl incurred secured debt under a credit agreement  dated june   with certain lenders and jp morgan chase bank formerly  the chase manhattan bank  as administrative agent the old senior credit facilities  consisting of a million tranche b term loan due june   a million tranche c term loan due june  collectively the old term loans and a revolving credit facility providing for revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit for the account of acl in an aggregate principal amount of up to million due june  the old revolving credit facility 
acl also issued million of unsecured senior notes due june the old senior notes  pursuant to an indenture the old indenture with united states trust company of new york  as trustee 
through may   acl was in default under its bank and bond debt  as well as its receivables facility  due to nonpayment of interest on the debt as well as other covenant violations 
on december   and subsequent thereto  acl elected not to pay the interest due on its bank and bond debt due to ongoing negotiations with its bankers and noteholders regarding the restructuring of the debt 
acl obtained forbearance agreements or waivers which enabled it to complete the danielson recapitalization and the debt restructuring described below in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on march   danielson entered into a definitive recapitalization agreement regarding the acquisition and recapitalization of acl the danielson recapitalization by danielson 
on april   acl launched an exchange offer pursuant to which acl offered to exchange the old senior notes for a new series of senior notes due january  the senior notes and a new class of pay in kind senior subordinated notes due july  the pik notes 
on april   acl and certain lenders executed an amendment agreement under which the old senior credit facilities would be amended and restated senior credit facilities upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the amendment agreement  including the consummation of the danielson recapitalization 
effective may   the danielson recapitalization was consummated with million of the old senior notes and interest thereon  if any  contributed by danielson to acl holdings  million  plus accrued interest  of the remaining million in old senior notes exchanged for new senior notes  and new pik notes and the old senior credit facilities amended 
as part of the danielson recapitalization  dhc contributed million in cash to acl holdings  which was immediately used to reduce the outstanding old term loans under the old senior credit facilities 
in addition  million of the amount outstanding under the old revolving credit facility was converted into a new term loan the tranche a term loan 
upon completion of the danielson restructuring  acl became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of dhc 
at that same time  sz investments  llc szi increased its equity ownership in dhc to approximately 
samuel zell  dhc s president  chief executive officer and chairman of dhc s board of directors  and philip g 
tinkler  dhc s chief financial officer  are affiliated with szi and hy i investments  llc hyi

due to these and other factors  acl s revenues and earnings did not meet expectations and acl s liquidity was significantly impaired and acl was unable to comply with its various debt covenants 
as a result  acl was unable to meet certain of its financial obligations as they became due 
on january  the petition date  acl filed a petition with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of indiana  new albany division the bankruptcy court to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code or chapter under case number included in the filing are acl  acl holdings  acbl  jeffboat  louisiana dock company llc and ten other us subsidiaries of acl collectively with acl  the debtors under case numbers through these cases are jointly administered for procedural purposes before the bankruptcy court under case number the chapter petitions do not cover any of acl s foreign subsidiaries or certain of its us subsidiaries  gms or vessel leasing 
dhc did not file for chapter protection and is not a party to any proceedings under the bankruptcy code 
acl and the other debtors will continue to operate their businesses as debtors in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and orders of the bankruptcy court 
as debtors in possession  the debtors may not engage in transactions outside of the ordinary course of business without approval  after notice and hearing  of the bankruptcy court 
as part of the chapter cases  the debtors intend to develop and propose for confirmation pursuant to chapter a plan of reorganization that will restructure the operations and liabilities of the debtors to the extent necessary to result in the continuing viability of acl 
a filing date for such a plan has not been determined  however  acl has the exclusive right to submit a plan of reorganization within the first days of the petition date 
acl and the other debtors received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay or otherwise honor certain of their pre petition obligations  including but not limited to employee wages and certain employee benefits  certain critical vendor payments  certain insurance and claim obligations  and certain tax obligations  as a plan of reorganization is developed 
furthermore  the debtors have entered into a bankruptcy court approved debtor in possession dip financing arrangement which was originally entered into on january  and which was amended on march   the dip credit facility that provides up to million of financing 
as of march   participating bank commitments under the dip credit facility total million  of which the debtors have drawn million  which was used to retire the pre petition receivables facility as hereinafter defined and which continues to be used to fund the debtors day to day cash needs 
the dip credit facility is secured by the same and additional assets that collateralized the senior credit facility as hereinafter defined and the pre petition receivables facility  and bears interest  at acl s option  at london interbank offered rates libor plus four percent or an alternate base rate as defined in the dip credit facility plus three percent 
there are also certain interest rates applicable in the event of a default under the dip credit facility 
the dip credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  restrict the debtors ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee the obligations of others 
acl is also required to maintain minimum cumulative ebitda  as defined in the dip credit facility  and limit its capital expenditures 
as a result of the chapter filings  certain events of default under the senior credit facilities  senior notes  pik notes and old senior notes all as hereinafter defined have occurred subsequent to december   the effects of which are stayed pursuant to certain provisions of the bankruptcy code 
under chapter  actions by creditors to collect claims in existence at the filing date pre petition claims are stayed or deferred absent specific bankruptcy court authorization to pay such pre petition claims while the debtors continue to manage their businesses as debtors in possession and act to develop a plan of reorganization 
a claims bar date has not yet been established 
the amount of the claims to be filed against the debtors by their creditors could be significantly different than the amount of the liabilities recorded by the debtors 
the debtors also have numerous executory contracts and other agreements that could be assumed or rejected during the chapter proceedings 
parties affected by these rejections may file claims with the bankruptcy court in accordance with the bankruptcy code  applicable bankruptcy rules and orders of the bankruptcy court 
under these chapter proceedings  the rights of and ultimate payments to pre petition creditors  rejection damage claimants and dhc as the sole equity investor in acl may be substantially altered 
this could result in claims being allowed and or satisfied in the chapter proceedings at less possibly substantially less than of their face value  and the acl membership interests indirectly owned by dhc being diluted or cancelled 
the debtors have not yet proposed a plan of reorganization 
the debtors pre petition creditors and dhc will each have a vote in the plan of reorganization 
the united states trustee has appointed an unsecured creditors committee 
the unsecured creditors committee and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy creditors 
the chapter process presents inherent material uncertainty  it is not possible to determine the additional amount of claims that may arise or ultimately be filed  or predict the length of time that the debtors will continue to operate under the protection of chapter  the outcome of the chapter proceedings in general  whether the debtors will continue to operate in their present organizational structure  or the effects of the proceedings on the business of acl  the other debtors and its non filing subsidiaries and affiliates  or on the interests of the various creditors  security holders and dhc as acl s indirect sole equity holder 
the ultimate recovery  if any  by creditors  security holders and dhc will not be determined until  at the earliest  confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
no assurance can be given as to what value  if any  will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies 
accordingly  dhc urges that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of dhc s or acl s securities 
while it cannot presently be determined  dhc may receive little or no value with respect to its equity interest in acl 
marine services industry domestic barging focuses on four core commodity groups steel other bulk commodities  grain  coal and liquids 
because barging provides a low cost transportation alternative for high mass high volume cargoes  many bulk commodity shippers choose barging as their preferred mode of transportation 
coal is the barging industry s largest transport commodity from a tonnage standpoint  while grain is a material driver for the industry s overall freight rate structure for dry cargo movements due to the effect the varying levels of grain export demand has on capacity and rates 
chemicals are the primary liquid cargo handled by liquid barge carriers  along with petroleum products  edible oils  molasses and ethanol 
safety and quality control are essential factors in serving this market 
the barging industry uses two types of equipment to move freight towboats  providing the power source  and barges  providing the freight capacity 
each standard dry cargo barge is capable of transporting approximately  tons of cargo with the most common tank barges being either  barrel or  barrel capacity 
the combination of a towboat and barges is called a tow  and usually consists of one towboat and from to barges 
the number of barges in a tow will depend upon the horsepower of the towboat  the river capacity and conditions  the load and empty mix of the tow  the direction of travel and the commodity carried 
since  the industry has been consolidating as acquiring companies have moved towards attaining the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major national customers 
following ingram industries inc s which operated  barges and towboats acquisition of midland enterprises inc which operated  barges and towboats on july   there are five major domestic barging companies that operate more than  barges 
there are also mid sized operators that operate more than barges  and approximately of the barging capacity is held by small carriers that operate fewer than barges 
marine services operations domestic barging 
in  acbl maintained its position as the leading provider of barge transportation in the united states  operating over nearly  miles of the inland waterways and transporting a wide variety of commodities  including steel other bulk commodities  grain  coal and liquids 
acbl is ranked first in the united states in terms of revenues  barges operated and gross tons hauled 
in terms of annual riverborne tonnage  acbl is the leading grain transporter in the industry  and is the second largest liquids transporter 
as of year end  acbl s fleet consisted of  dry cargo hopper barges and double skinned tank barges 
acbl operated  of these dry cargo hopper barges and of these tank barges pursuant to charter agreements 
the charter agreements have expiration dates ranging from one to fifteen years 
acbl expects generally to be able to renew or replace such charter agreements as they expire 
although acbl does not expect to purchase a material number of new barges in the year  acbl has a program to renew its fleet through which certain third party lenders or entities will acquire new equipment from jeffboat and lease that equipment to acbl 
acbl anticipates that it will obtain new barges through this program in domestic fleet profile by barge type average age years number barge types of barges acbl industry covered hoppers  open hoppers tank barges total  includes both owned and chartered equipment and excludes marine equipment used in international operations 
see below  international barging 
in addition  at year end acbl operated towboats with an average age of approximately years 
no comparative industry data is available with respect to towboats 
at year end  of these towboats were operated by acbl pursuant to charter agreements 
the charter agreements have expiration dates ranging from one to five years 
acbl generally expects to be able to renew or replace such charter agreements as they expire 
the size and diversity of acbl s towboat fleet allows it to deploy the towboats to the portions of the inland waterways where they can most effectively operate 
for example  acbl s towboats that have in excess of  horsepower operate with tow sizes of as many as barges along the lower mississippi river where the river channels are wider and there are no restricting locks and dams 
acbl s  horsepower towboats operate along the ohio  upper mississippi and illinois rivers where the river channels are narrower and restricting locks and dams are more prevalent 
acbl deploys smaller horsepower towboats for shuttle and harbor services 
domestic towboats by horsepower number of average age horsepower towboats years  and below total includes both owned and chartered equipment and excludes marine equipment used in international operations 
see below  international barging 
acbl s barging operations encompass four core commodity groups steel other bulk commodities  grain  coal and liquids 
in terms of tonnage and revenue  grain and coal are acbl s largest transport commodities with steel other bulk commodities and liquids second and third  respectively 
acl domestic barging operations by commodity revenue tonnage revenue tonnage revenue tonnage dollars and tonnage in millions grain coal bulk steel liquids other total includes towing and demurrage 
to support its domestic barging operations  acl maintains shore based facilities throughout the inland waterways that provide fleeting  shifting  cleaning and repair services for both towboats and barges  including five towboat dry docks and nine barge dry docks 
international barging 
acl launched its international barging operations in south america in acl international currently operates on the orinoco river  with headquarters in puerto ordaz  venezuela  and through uabl on the parana paraguay river system  with headquarters in buenos aires  argentina 
acl international also operates on the higuamo river in the dominican republic with headquarters in santa domingo 
international operations generated of acl s operating revenue  and management expects revenues from international operations to increase in the coming years 
acl international s expansion in south america has been accomplished by introducing new equipment and technology to the south american river systems  utilizing systems used in the united states  developing new processes to meet local requirements and consolidating operations to improve efficiencies 
acl international expects to use its expertise to expand its barging operations into new regions 
for additional information regarding dhc s foreign operations  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
international fleet profile by barge type excludes uabl number average age barge types of barges years covered hoppers open hoppers tank barges deck total at year end  acl international operated dry cargo barges pursuant to charter agreements with expiration dates of one year 
acl international expects generally to be able to renew or replace such charter agreements as they expire 
in addition  acl international operated six towboats 
barge and towboat design and manufacturing 
jeffboat manufactures both towboats and barges for acbl  acl international  and other customers primarily for inland river service  and also produces coastal and offshore equipment and other special purpose vessels such as cruise boats  casino boats  and us army corps of engineers vessels 
jeffboat has long been recognized as a leader in inland marine technology  incorporating designs and propulsion systems derived from ongoing model basin studies 
jeffboat also provides around the clock vessel repair services  including complete dry docking capabilities  back up support for emergency cargo salvage and equipment recovery  and full machine shop facilities for repair and storage of towboat propellers  rudders and shafts 
in  jeffboat was a leading producer of inland barges in the united states  producing approximately one third of the new supply of inland barges for the barging industry 
acl believes that the relationship between its transportation operations and jeffboat provides a competitive advantage to acl  permitting optimization of construction schedules and asset utilization between acl s internal requirements and sales to customers 
the relationship also gives jeffboat s engineers an opportunity to collaborate with acl s barge operations on innovations that optimize towboat performance and barge life 
operations at jeffboat were interrupted in by a strike of its unionized employees from april  until july  due to sharply decreased demand for new barges and other marine equipment  jeffboat has subsequently laid off a substantial number of its employees 
terminals 
acl s terminal subsidiary  act  directly operates two facilities located on the inland waterways at st 
louis  missouri and memphis  tennessee 
gms  acl s terminal joint venture  operates terminal or warehouse facilities at guntersville  alabama  jeffersonville and evansville  indiana  louisville  kentucky  omaha and nebraska city  nebraska  cincinnati  ohio  decatur  alabama two sites  helena  pine bluff  west memphis two sites and ft 
smith two sites  arkansas  chicago  illinois  industry  pennsylvania two sites  memphis  tennessee two sites  houston  texas  and vlissingen  the netherlands 
gms also operates four service operations at battle creek  michigan  mingo junction  ohio  brooklyn junction  west virginia  and vancouver  canada 
in addition  gms and acl are equity investors in a terminal operation in puerto ordaz  venezuela 
marine services customers acbl s primary customers include many of the nation s major industrial and agricultural companies 
acbl enters into a wide variety of short and long term contracts with these customers ranging from annual one year contracts to multi year extended contracts with inflation adjustments 
acbl s top customers accounted for of acl s fiscal operating revenue 
one customer  cargill  inc  accounted for more than of acl s fiscal consolidated operating revenue 
acbl operates a hour planning center at its headquarters in jeffersonville  indiana to provide around the clock customer contact and planning capability 
in addition to enhanced customer service  the planning center has improved communication between vessels and office staff for more efficient logistics and better asset utilization 
marine services competition acl s barging operations compete on the basis of price  service and equipment availability 
primary competitors of acl s barging operations include other barge lines  railroads  trucks and pipelines 
barge transportation provides the lowest unit cost of delivery of any major form of transportation for high volume  bulk products  delivering of the volume of us freight for of the total us freight cost  according to data available from the us department of transportation 
one standard hopper barge has the equivalent carrying capacity of railcars or trucks 
in areas where shippers have access to water transportation  the rate per ton mile is significantly less than rail rates and approximately to lower than truck rates 
while it is generally less expensive to move large volumes of certain liquids by pipeline when both the origin and destination have a direct connection to the pipeline  barge transportation of liquids has greater flexibility with respect to the origins and destinations that can be served 
competition within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense 
there are a number of companies offering transportation services on the inland waterways 
carriers compete not only on the basis of commodity shipping rates  but also with respect to value added services  including more convenient and flexible scheduling  more timely information and different equipment 
acl utilizes its boat and barge repair and vessel fleeting facilities  jeffboat s shipbuilding capabilities and the geographically broad based terminals of act and gms to support its core barging business and to offer a combination of competitive pricing and high quality service to its customer base 
acl considers trinity industries inc to be a significant competitor to jeffboat 
acl believes that in addition to trinity  jeffboat s other significant competitors include bollinger machine shop and shipyard  inc and galveston shipbuilding company for barges  and friede goldman halter  inc and quality shipyards  inc for towboats  all of which are located primarily on the gulf of mexico 
these other competitors do not currently manufacture barges  however  should market conditions change they could quickly ready their shipyards to construct inland barges and related equipment 
marine services intellectual property acl registers some of its material trademarks  tradenames and copyrights and has acquired patent protection for some of its proprietary processes 
acl has current trademark rights to conduct its business 
marine services insurance acl maintains protection and indemnity insurance to cover liabilities arising out of the ownership and operation of marine vessels 
acl maintains hull and machinery insurance policies on each of its vessels in amounts related to the value of each vessel 
each vessel is insured at its current fair market value  however  damage claims are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of million 
acl maintains coverage for shore side properties  shipboard consumables and inventory  spare parts  worker s compensation  and general liability risks 
acl maintains primary insurance and third party guaranty agreements as to its statutory liabilities for discharges of oil or hazardous substances under the federal oil pollution act of in the future  acl may elect to self insure such primary statutory liability amounts  however  acl currently maintains and expects to continue to maintain excess coverage for pollution liability 
all insurance policies have been obtained and arranged through the aon insurance brokerage syndicate  other brokers or direct placement with commercial insurers  and maintained with underwriters in the united states  british and other markets 
insurance premiums for the coverages described above will vary from year to year depending upon acl s loss record and market conditions 
in order to reduce premiums  acl maintains certain per occurrence deductible  annual aggregate deductible and self insured retention levels that it believes are prudent and generally consistent with those maintained by other shipping companies 
the insurance services business nature of insurance operations naicc is engaged in writing almost exclusively non standard private passenger automobile and commercial automobile insurance primarily in california 
through january  naicc and valor wrote workers compensation insurance primarily in california and montana 
the accounts and operations of naicc and dind  naicc s parent and a wholly owned subsidiary of dhc  are included in the consolidated financial statements of dhc and are collectively referred to herein as naicc 
naicc began writing non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california in july  and in oregon and washington in april and in arizona in naicc writes its california business primarily through one general agent 
oregon  washington and arizona business is written directly through appointed independent agents 
policyholder selection is governed by underwriting guidelines established by naicc 
naicc began writing non standard commercial automobile in through independent agents 
non standard risks are those segments of the driving public which generally are not considered preferred business  such as drivers with a record of prior accidents or driving violations  drivers involved in particular occupations or driving certain types of vehicles  or those who have been non renewed or declined by another insurance company 
generally  non standard premium rates are higher than standard premium rates and policy limits are lower than typical policy limits 
management believes that it is able to achieve underwriting success through refinement of various risk profiles  thereby dividing the non standard market into more defined segments which can be adequately priced 
the majority of automobiles owned or used by businesses are insured under policies that provide other coverage for the business  such as commercial multi peril insurance 
businesses which are unable to insure a specific driver and businesses having vehicles not qualifying for commercial multi peril insurance are typical naicc commercial automobile policyholders 
examples of these risks include drivers with more than one moving violation  one and two vehicle accounts  and specialty haulers  such as sand and gravel  farm vehicles and certain short haul common carriers 
the typical naicc commercial automobile policy covers fleets of four or fewer vehicles 
naicc does not insure long haul truckers  trucks hauling logs  gasoline or similar higher hazard operations 
the current average annual premium of the policies in force is approximately  net written premiums for all private passenger automobile programs were million  million and million in  and respectively 
net written premiums were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  for the non standard private passenger automobile program 
net written premiums for preferred private passenger automobile were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net written premiums for non standard private passenger automobile in california were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net written premiums for non standard private passenger automobile outside california were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the primary reason for increase in private passenger automobile premiums in is growth in the california non standard program 
the decrease in was due to the cancellation of the preferred private passenger automobile program in early and the cancellation of non standard private passenger automobile outside of california 
the decrease in california non standard private passenger automobile premiums was due to increased competition in the california marketplace 
until january   naicc ceded percent of its california non standard private passenger automobile business to a major reinsurance company under a quota share reinsurance agreement 
effective january  the treaty was not renewed 
naicc s oregon and washington non standard automobile  california preferred automobile business  and its commercial automobile business is reinsured on an excess of loss basis  where the company retains the first net written premiums for commercial automobile were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in commercial automobile premiums during is attributable to management s decision in late to curtail marketing efforts in this line 
naicc previously wrote workers compensation insurance in california and four other western states 
workers compensation insurance policies provide coverage for statutory benefits which employers are required to pay to employees who are injured in the course of employment including  among other things  temporary or permanent disability benefits  death benefits  medical and hospital expenses and expenses for vocational rehabilitation 
policies were issued having a term of no more than one year 
in response to market developments affecting california workers compensation  including worsening loss experience  naicc decided to exit the workers compensation line of business 
the last california workers compensation policy was issued in july and the last policy issued outside of california was issued in january net written premiums for workers compensation were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the decision to exit the workers compensation line as discussed above 
the small decrease in reflected reduced production in california that was mitigated by growth in montana 
naicc acquired valor in june valor is a montana domiciled specialty insurance company that writes workers compensation policies 
net written premiums for valor workers compensation were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
valor began non renewing all policies in december and was placed into run off effective january naicc does not write any business through managing general agents 
its california non standard private passenger automobile  representing of net written premiums  is produced through one general agent as compared to in for the same general agent 
in  naicc discontinued its california preferred private passenger auto program in california which had been produced through another general agent and which represented of net written premium in underwriting insurers admitted in california are required to obtain approval from the california department of insurance of rates and or forms prior to being used 
many of the states in which naicc does business have similar requirements 
rates and policy forms are developed by naicc and filed with the regulators in each of the relevant states  depending upon each state s requirements 
naicc relies upon its own as well as industry experience in establishing rates 
private passenger automobile policy limits vary by state 
in california  non standard policies provide maximum coverage up to  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
in arizona  oregon  and washington  non standard policies provide minimum coverage of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage  and can provide coverage to a maximum of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
in general  preferred policies provide coverage to a maximum of  per person   per accident for liability and bodily injury and  per accident for property damage 
the maximum non standard commercial automobile policy limit provided by naicc is million bodily injury and property damage combined single limit of liability for each occurrence 
naicc retains the first  bodily injury and property damage combined single limit of liability for each occurrence 
naicc retains the first  of each workers compensation loss and has purchased reinsurance for up to million in excess of its retention  the first million of which are placed with three major reinsurance companies with the remaining million being provided by other companies 
in april  naicc entered into a workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement with scor re insurance company that provided coverage down to  in may  naicc entered into a workers compensation excess of loss reinsurance agreement with pma re insurance company that provided coverage down to  marketing of insurance services naicc maintains three sales offices 
the offices are located in long beach  california  phoenix  arizona and napa  california  with each office employing a single marketing representative 
as a result of the decision to exit certain lines of business  naicc closed its fresno  california and portland  oregon offices and reduced its marketing personnel in both its long beach and napa  california offices 
naicc believes that its local presence allows it to better serve policyholders and independent agents 
all other functions of policyholder service  renewal underwriting  policy issuance  premium collection and record retention are performed centrally at naicc s home office in long beach  california 
naicc currently markets its non standard private passenger automobile insurance in california only by using one general agent that uses over sub agents to obtain applications for policies 
naicc wrote non standard private passenger automobile insurance directly through appointed independent agents in arizona  idaho  nevada  oregon and washington 
during it was decided to cease writing new policies for non standard private passenger automobile outside of california 
the appointed independent agents were reduced accordingly 
naicc  which began a preferred private passenger automobile program in california in february marketed through a second general agent  discontinued the program in however  certain renewals on this program were continued into during  naicc marketed its non standard commercial automobile insurance through approximately independent agents located in arizona  california  idaho  nevada  oregon  utah and washington 
at the end of naicc reduced its appointed agents to approximately compared to at the end of prior to  naicc wrote workers compensation business primarily in the states of california  oregon  arizona  idaho and montana through more than independent agents 
in july naicc ceased writing policies in california  arizona  and nevada 
naicc stopped writing oregon and idaho polices in december valor marketed workers compensation insurance to montana employers 
all business is produced and serviced through its home office in billings  montana 
naicc targeted employers having operations that are classified as low to moderate hazard and that generally have payrolls under million 
typically  annual premiums for employers in this payroll category are less than  valor wrote workers compensation for employers of a wide range of hazard classifications  from banks to construction businesses  and targeted the larger employers in the state of montana 
valor began non renewing its policies in december and the company was placed into run off effective january insurance business claims all automobile claims are handled by employees of naicc at its home office in long beach  california 
claims are reported by agents  insureds and claimants directly to naicc 
claims involving suspected fraud are referred to an in house special investigation unit siu which manages a detailed investigation of these claims using outside investigative firms 
when evidence of fraudulent activity is identified  the siu works with the various state departments of insurance  the national insurance crime bureau and local law enforcement agencies in handling the claims 
workers compensation claims are received  reviewed  and processed by naicc employees located in claims service offices in long beach  california 
most of naicc s policyholders are not of sufficient size or type to make a specialized managed care approach to medical cost containment more cost effective 
the california automobile assigned risk plan provides for state mandated minimum levels of automobile liability coverage to drivers whose driving records  or other relevant characteristics  make it difficult for them to obtain insurance coverage in the voluntary market 
naicc does not expect to receive a material number of assignments arising from this program  and does not believe that the assignments will have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
losses and loss adjustment expenses naicc s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae represent the estimated indemnity cost and loss adjustment expenses necessary to cover the ultimate net cost of investigating and settling claims 
such estimates are based upon estimates for reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for insurance assumed  and actuarial estimates based upon historical company and industry experience for development of reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported 
any changes in estimates of ultimate liability are reflected in current operating results 
inflation is assumed  along with other factors  in estimating future claim costs and related liabilities 
naicc does not discount any of its loss reserves 
the ultimate cost of claims is difficult to predict for several reasons 
claims may not be reported until many years after they are incurred 
changes in the rate of inflation and the legal environment have created forecasting complications 
court decisions may dramatically increase liability in the time between the dates on which a claim is reported and its resolution 
punitive damages awards have grown in frequency and magnitude 
the courts have imposed increasing obligations on insurance companies to defend policyholders 
as a result  the frequency and severity of claims have grown rapidly and unpredictably 
naicc has claims for environmental clean up against policies issued prior to and which are currently in run off 
the principal exposure arises from direct excess and primary policies of business in run off  the obligations of which were assumed by naicc in these direct excess and primary claims are relatively few in number and have policy limits of between  and  with reinsurance generally above  naicc also has environmental claims arising associated with participation in excess of loss reinsurance contracts assumed by naicc 
these reinsurance contracts have relatively low limits  generally less than  and estimates of unpaid losses are based on information provided by the primary insurance company 
the unpaid loss and lae related to environmental cleanup is established considering facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are estimated for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific contract of insurance or reinsurance and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
estimates for unknown claims and development or reported claims are included in naicc s unpaid loss and lae 
the liability for development of reported claims is based on the estimates of the range of potential losses for reported claims in the aggregate 
estimates of liabilities are reviewed and updated continually and there is the potential that naicc s exposure could be materially in excess of amounts that are currently recorded 
management does not expect that liabilities associated with these types of claims will result in a material adverse effect on future liquidity or financial position 
however  claims such as these are based upon estimates and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed  or even materially exceed  such estimates 
as of december  and  naicc s net unpaid losses and lae relating to environmental claims was approximately million and million  respectively 
due to the factors discussed above and others  the process used in estimating unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses cannot provide an exact result 
management believes that the provisions for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate to cover the net cost of losses and loss expenses incurred to date  however  such liability is necessarily based on estimates and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed such estimates 
the following table provides a reconciliation of naicc s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae in thousands years ended december  net unpaid losses and lae at beginning of year    incurred related to current year    prior years    total incurred    paid related to current year    prior years    total net paid    net unpaid losses and lae at december    plus reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses    gross unpaid losses and lae at december    the losses and lae incurred during related to prior years is attributable to adverse development on both the california workers compensation line totaling million  certain private passenger automobile programs totaling million  and commercial automobile totaling million 
the losses and lae incurred during related to prior years is attributable to adverse development on both the california workers compensation line totaling million and certain private passenger automobile programs  primarily outside of california  totaling million 
all of the workers compensation lines and the private passenger automobile programs that caused higher than expected losses were placed in run off during the losses and lae incurred during related to prior years is attributable to development on the commercial automobile lines and certain lines in run off 
the following table indicates the manner in which unpaid losses and lae at the end of a particular year change as time passes 
the first line reflects the liability as originally reported  net of reinsurance  at the end of the stated year 
each calendar year end liability includes the estimated liability for that accident year and all prior accident years comprising that liability 
the second section shows the original recorded net liability as of the end of successive years adjusted to reflect facts and circumstance that are later discovered 
the next line  cumulative deficiency or redundancy  compares the adjusted net liability amount to the net liability amount as originally established and reflects whether the net liability as originally recorded was adequate to cover the estimated cost of claims or redundant 
the third section reflects the cumulative amounts related to that liability that were paid  net of reinsurance  as of the end of successive years

the increase in was attributable to adverse development 
the cumulative deficiency as of december  and on a net basis of million and million  respectively  is due in part to the strengthening of the unpaid losses and alae of pre businesses assumed by naicc in and which are in run off 
naicc increased these run off claim liabilities by million in the pre run off liabilities include claims relating to environmental clean up for policies issued prior to the cumulative deficiency on a net basis of million and million december  and  respectively  is also attributable to both adverse development of workers compensation loss experience in the and loss years  and development in certain lines in run off 
the california workers compensation industry  including naicc  experienced adverse development of those loss years 
the adverse development in and was significantly offset by favorable workers compensation loss experience and development in the through loss years thus the reduction noted from to conditions and trends that have affected the development of these liabilities in the past may not necessarily recur in the future especially considering that those ongoing lines that have experienced the greatest adverse development have been placed in run off in it may not be appropriate to use this cumulative history in the projection of future performance 
reinsurance in its normal course of business in accordance with industry practice  naicc reinsures a portion of its exposure with other insurance companies so as to effectively limit its maximum loss arising out of any one occurrence 
contracts of reinsurance do not legally discharge the original insurer from its primary liability 
estimated reinsurance receivables arising from these contracts of reinsurance are  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  reported separately as assets 
premiums for reinsurance ceded by naicc in and were and of direct written premiums  respectively 
as of december   general reinsurance corporation genre  and mitsui sumitomo insurance company  ltd 
mitsui  were the only reinsurers that comprised more than of naicc s reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid balances 
naicc monitors all reinsurers  by reviewing am best reports and ratings  information obtained from reinsurance intermediaries and analyzing financial statements 
at december  naicc had reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid balances of million and million from genre and mitsui  respectively 
both genre and mitsui have an am best rating of a or better 
the unsecured balance from mitsui is approximately million 
the paid and unpaid recoverable amounts ceded to mitsui relate to business in run off and assumed by naicc 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on reinsurance 
naicc and two of its subsidiaries participate in an inter company pooling and reinsurance agreement 
under this agreement danielson insurance company dico and danielson national insurance company dnic cede of their net liability  defined to include premiums  losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses  to naicc to be combined with the net liability for policies of naicc in formation of the pool 
naicc simultaneously cedes to dico and dnic of the net liability of the pool 
dnic commenced participation in july  and dico commenced in january additionally  both dico and dnic reimburse naicc for executive services  professional services  and administrative expenses based on designated percentages of net premiums written for each line of business 
government regulation general dhc s holding company business is not regulated by any government agency 
dhc s marine services and insurance services businesses are highly regulated as discussed below 
regulation of marine services business the marine service s business is highly regulated and subject to government regulation in the form of international treaties  conventions  national  state and local laws and regulations  and laws and regulations of the flag nations of its vessels  including laws relating to the discharge of materials into the environment 
because such conventions  laws and regulations are regularly reviewed and revised by the issuing governmental bodies  dhc is unable to predict the ultimate costs or impacts of compliance 
in addition  acl is required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses and certificates with respect to dhc s marine services business operations 
the kinds of permits  licenses and certificates required depend upon such factors as the country of registry  the commodity transported  the waters in which the vessel operates  the nationality of the vessel s crew  the age of the vessel and the status of acl as owner  operator or charterer 
dhc believes that acl and its subsidiaries currently have all permits  licenses and certificates necessary to permit its vessels to operate in their current trades 
acl s domestic transportation operations are subject to regulation by the us coast guard  federal laws  state laws and certain international conventions 
acl s inland tank barges are inspected by the us coast guard and carry certificates of inspection 
acl s towing vessels and dry cargo barges are not subject to us coast guard inspection requirements 
jones act the jones act is a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the united states to vessels built and registered in the united states 
furthermore  the jones act requires that the vessels be manned by us citizens and owned by us citizens 
for a limited liability company to qualify as a us citizen for the purpose of domestic trade  of the company s beneficial stockholders must be us citizens 
acl presently meets all of the requirements of the jones act for its owned vessels 
compliance with us ownership requirements of the jones act is very important to the operations of acl  and the loss of jones act status could have a significant negative effect for acl 
acl monitors the citizenship requirements under the jones act of its employees and beneficial equity holders and will take action as necessary to ensure compliance with the jones act requirements 
during the past several years  the jones act cabotage laws have been challenged by interests seeking to facilitate foreign flag competition for trade reserved for us flag vessels under the jones act 
these efforts have been consistently defeated by large margins in the us congress 
the company believes that continued efforts may be made to modify or eliminate the cabotage provisions of the jones act 
if such efforts are successful so as to permit foreign competition  such competition could have an adverse effect on acl 
user fees and fuel tax federal legislation requires that inland marine transportation companies pay a user fee in the form of a tax assessed upon propulsion fuel used by vessels engaged in trade along inland waterways that are maintained by the us army corps of engineers 
such user fees are designed to help defray the costs associated with replacing major components of the waterway system  including dams and locks  and to build new projects 
a significant portion of the inland waterways on which acl s vessels operate are maintained by the corps of engineers 
acl presently pays a federal fuel tax of cents per gallon of fuel consumed by its towboats 
legislation has been proposed to repeal a portion cents per gallon of the federal fuel tax 
in the future  existing user fees may be increased  and additional user fees imposed  to defray the costs of inland waterways infrastructure and navigation 
regulation of insurance services business insurance companies are subject to insurance laws and regulations established by the states in which they transact business 
the agencies established pursuant to these state laws have broad administrative and supervisory powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  regulation of trade practices  establishment of guaranty associations  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms  premium rate filing requirements  reserve requirements  the form and content of required regulatory financial statements  capital and surplus requirements and the maximum concentrations of certain classes of investments 
most states also have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems  including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
dhc and its insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to such legislation in california and routinely report to other jurisdictions 
the national association of insurance commissioners has formed committees and appointed advisory groups to study and formulate regulatory proposals on such diverse issues as the use of surplus debentures  accounting for reinsurance transactions and the adoption of risk based capital requirements 
it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulation on the operations of dhc or its insurance services business 
effective january   the association s codified statutory accounting principles sap has been adopted by all us insurance companies 
the purpose of such codification is to provide a comprehensive basis of accounting and reporting to insurance departments 
although codification is expected to be the foundation of a state s statutory accounting practice  it may be subject to modification by practices prescribed or permitted by a state s insurance commissioner 
therefore  statutory financial statements will continue to be prepared on the basis of accounting practice prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile 
dhc has determined that the application of the codification did not have a material impact on the statutory capital of its insurance subsidiaries upon adoption 
naicc is an insurance company domiciled in the state of california and is regulated by the california department of insurance for the benefit of policyholders 
the california insurance code does not permit the payment of an extraordinary shareholder dividend without prior approval from the insurance commissioner 
dividends are considered extraordinary if they exceed the greater of net income or of statutory surplus as of the preceding december st 
at this time and into the foreseeable future naicc does not have sufficient accumulated earned surplus to pay further ordinary dividends 
capital adequacy and risk based capital a model for determining the risk based capital rbc requirements for property and casualty insurance companies was adopted in december the model generally assesses the company s investments and underwriting operations and determines policyholders surplus levels to support such activity 
naicc has calculated its rbc requirement under the most recent rbc model and it has sufficient capital in excess of any regulatory action level 
the rbc model sets forth four levels of increasing regulatory intervention company action level of an insurer s authorized control level at which the insurer must submit to the regulator a plan for increasing such insurer s capital  regulatory action level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the insurer must submit a plan for increasing its capital to the regulator and the regulator may issue corrective orders  authorized control level a multi step calculation based upon information derived from an insurer s most recent filed statutory annual statement  at which the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer  and mandatory control level of an insurer s authorized control level  at which the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer 
at december   the rbc of naicc was greater than the company action level compared to in the significant decrease is attributable to underwriting losses caused primarily in those lines in run off and investment losses realized during the period 
naicc currently has no plans to take any action designed to negatively affect its current rbc level 
as discussed further in this report at item  business acl bankruptcy considerations  acl filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  it was determined that naicc s investment in acl was fully impaired for statutory accounting purposes 
at december   naicc recognized a statutory charge to its surplus of million 
this charge  when combined with naicc s underwriting results and investment losses  reduced its statutory surplus level below the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
in response to the above statutory condition  dhc repaid the million note due may to naicc  and further contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital during february with permission from the california department of insurance  these amounts were recorded as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes at december  after consideration for the million noted above  naicc s reported capital and surplus as of december  was above the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
environmental matters acl s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations which  among other things  specify requirements for the management of oil  hazardous wastes  and hazardous substances and impose liability for releases of these materials into the environment 
acl devotes resources toward achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental requirements 
dhc believes  except as otherwise set forth herein  that acl is in material compliance with environmental requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that acl will be at all times in material compliance with all environmental requirements 
as is the case with others in the maritime industry  a release of oil  hazardous waste  hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment at or by its properties or vessels  as a result of acl s current or past operations  or at a facility to which acl has shipped wastes  or the existence of historical contamination at any of its properties  could result in material liability to acl 
acl conducts loading and unloading of dry commodities  liquids and scrap materials in and near waterways 
such operations present a potential that some such materials might be spilled into a waterway thereby exposing acl to potential liability 
while the amount of such liability could be material  acl endeavors to conduct its operations in a manner that it believes reduces such risks 
federal  state and local governments could in the future enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that affect acl s operations or facilities  increase its costs of operation  or adversely affect the demand for acl s services 
dhc cannot predict the effect that such future laws or regulations could have on its marine services business 
nor can dhc predict what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its current or past facilities or at other properties where acl or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of wastes and the extent of liability that may result from the discovery of such conditions 
it is possible that such future laws or undiscovered conditions could have a material adverse effect on dhc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
acl is involved as a potentially responsible party prp or interested party with respect to the clean up of hazardous waste disposal sites superfund sites identified under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  the federal superfund clean up statute  and similar state laws 
while cercla authorizes joint and several liability for remediation costs at clean up or remediation sites  as a practical matter  such costs are typically allocated among the waste generators and other involved parties 
pursuant to the recapitalization  acl assumed liability under an order from the us environmental protection agency epa under cercla  regarding contamination at the former dravo mechling property in seneca  illinois 
acl has complied with the terms of the order  which requires performance of site sampling and certain remediation at the site 
as a result of these remediation efforts  the site has been materially remediated 
the epa and the state of illinois have issued no further remediation letters to acl indicating that neither entity will require further remediation 
in  acl sold the seneca  illinois property to a third party 
dhc is aware of no ongoing environmental issues or exposure with respect to this property 
jeffboat was named a prp at the third site in zionsville  indiana 
jeffboat has also received notice of potential liability with regard to waste allegedly transshipped from the third site to the four county landfill in rochester  indiana 
the epa has conducted an environmental site assessment of this property and has approved a work plan to conclude remediation of the site 
the expected cost of this remediation has been funded by the various prps  of which jeffboat has funded its percentage share 
at this time  no further expense associated with the remediation of third site is expected 
a group of barge operators  including national marine  had barges cleaned at the sba shipyard in houma  louisiana  which is now conducting voluntary environmental remediation 
acl assumed national marine s liability in this matter pursuant to the recapitalization 
the sba shipyard owner who previously funded the cleanup effort has become insolvent and  as a result  the barge operators involved have formed a group to fund remediation 
the barge operators have funded their currently expected remediation expenses  of which acl has a share 
the barge operator group has removed all liquid waste capable of being pumped from the site and the epa has preliminarily approved a work plan to remove the solid waste 
remediation of the solid waste has not commenced as of the date of this report  but is expected to commence within the next year 
eps  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of vectura  is the owner of connex pipe systems closed solid waste landfill located in marietta  ohio connex 
liability for the monitoring and potential clean up of connex was assumed by acl up to  per year pursuant to the recapitalization 
in connex was subject to an ohio consent judgment consent judgment whereby it agreed to remediate and monitor the closed landfill for a period of three years 
connex complied with the consent judgment and in the ohio environmental protection agency ohio epa issued a letter confirming connex s compliance 
however  the ohio epa changed its monitoring requirements in to require longer periods of monitoring for closed sites and attempted to apply those new rules to connex 
connex  and other similarly situated companies  objected to the new rule which retroactively changed monitoring requirements 
on november   the ohio epa issued a finalized guidance rule final guidance applicable to connex 
acl believes that the final guidance confirmed connex s position that it had fully complied with the applicable monitoring requirements and owed no further monitoring 
acl believes that it has no further monitoring obligations at connex and written confirmation from the ohio epa has been requested to confirm that acl s monitoring responsibilities have ceased 
acbl has received notice from the epa that it is a prp at the state marine of port arthur state marine and the palmer barge line superfund sites in port arthur  texas in regard to approximately barges that were cleaned by state marine and five barges cleaned by palmer barge line for acbl in the early s 
the epa has requested that acbl  and other potentially responsible companies  enter into negotiations for the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibility study  however  there has been no further action to pursue any response costs from acbl as a prp 
on july   a lawsuit was filed in clark circuit court against jeffboat  acbl  acl and dhc by two jeffersonville  indiana residents purporting to represent a class of individuals affected by alleged fugitive emissions from jeffboat painting activity 
the named plaintiffs  seeking actual and punitive damages  claim that fugitive paint emissions have diminished the value of their automobiles and other property  and seek redress under a variety of theories  including negligence and trespass 
acbl  acl and dhc moved for and received a dismissal with prejudice 
jeffboat intends to defend this litigation vigorously and to contest any potential class certification 
jeffboat  acbl  acl and dhc have also received a notice of citizens suit concerning the alleged fugitive emissions and alleging other misconduct with respect to water pollution 
the notice was filed by the two named plaintiffs in the class action described above and seven other individuals 
the notice seeks to have state and federal authorities  who have previously inspected jeffboat and found no violations  to take additional regulatory action against jeffboat  or if they do not take such action  the right to sue to ask a federal court to redress their allegations 
a resulting suit would not entitle the citizens to damages  but could result in the imposition of penalties payable to the government and liability for the plaintiffs attorneys fees 
to date  no such action has been filed 
jeffboat would defend vigorously any resulting lawsuit against it 
because cercla liability is retroactive  it is possible in the future that acl may be identified as a prp with respect to other waste disposal sites  where wastes generated by acl have been transported and disposed 
as of december   acl had reserves of approximately million for environmental matters 
dhc believes it has established reasonable and adequate reserves to cover acl s known environmental liabilities 
however  given the uncertainties associated with such matters  there can be no assurance that liabilities will not exceed reserves 
dhc does not believe that its holding company business or insurance services business give rise to any significant environmental concerns 
occupational health and safety matters acl s domestic vessel operations are primarily regulated by the us coast guard for occupational health and safety standards 
acl s domestic shore operations are subject to the us occupational safety and health administration regulations 
while there can be no assurance that acl is at all times in complete compliance with all such regulations  acl believes that it is in material compliance with such regulations  and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on acl 
there can be no assurance  however  that claims will not be made against acl for work related illness or injury  or that the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which acl operates will not adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
acl endeavors to reduce employee exposure to hazards incident to its business through safety programs  training and preventive maintenance efforts 
the company emphasizes safety performance in all of its operating divisions 
acl believes that acl s safety performance consistently places it among the industry leaders as evidenced by what it believes are lower injury frequency levels than many of its competitors 
acl has been certified in the american waterway operators responsible carrier program which is oriented to enhancing safety in vessel operations 
employees as of december   on a consolidated basis  danielson employed  individuals of whom three worked for dhc at the parent company level 
acl employed  individuals 
of this total  individuals were engaged in shore side management and administrative functions   individuals were employed as boat officers and crew members on its marine vessels  individuals were engaged in production and repair activities at acl s shipyard facilities  and individuals were employed in production activities at acl s terminals 
six hundred of acl s domestic shore side employees are represented by unions 
most of these unionized employees approximately are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters at acl s jeffboat shipyard facility  where the contract with the union expires in april prior to the execution of the current union contract in july  jeffboat s union employees chose to strike from april  until july  one hundred twelve of acl s south american employees are represented by unions 
gms employed individuals and gms venezuela employed four individuals 
of this total  individuals were engaged in administrative functions and individuals were employed in production activities 
sixty six gms employees are represented by unions 
naicc had employees 
dhc believes that its relations with its employees are generally good  other than for any after effects of the jeffboat strike and the impact of employee layoffs at jeffboat  acl and various acl related entities that are a result of acl s current economic condition 
dhc believes that current staffing levels within each of its businesses are adequate to conduct future operations  although no assurances can be provided that additional reductions in work force will not be required 
backlog marine services acl s backlog represents firm orders for barge transportation and marine equipment 
the backlog for barge transportation was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
this backlog ranges from one to nine years with approximately expected to be filled in the backlog for marine equipment construction was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the backlog for marine equipment is one year with expected to be filled in insurance services the insurance services business does not create backlog 
seasonality marine services acl s business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits historically have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters july through december due to the north american grain harvest 
in addition  working capital requirements fluctuate throughout the year 
adverse market or operating conditions during the last four months of the year could have a greater effect on acl s business  financial condition and results of operations than during other periods 
gms north american business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits historically have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year and higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to the north american grain harvest and poorer winter operating and river conditions 
in addition  working capital requirements for gms fluctuate throughout the year 
uabl s business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits historically have been lower during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the year june through january  the south american winter season  which reduces grain volumes for barging and which creates poor operating and river conditions  and higher during the first and second fiscal quarters december through july due to the south american grain harvest 
gmsv s business is seasonal at the same times and for the same reasons as uabl 
in addition  working capital requirements for uabl and gmsv fluctuate throughout the year 
insurance services the insurance services group is not materially affected by seasonal conditions 
risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on dhc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
bankruptcy specific risks impact of acl bankruptcy on dhc while the final result of acl s bankruptcy proceeding is uncertain  dhc s investment in acl may have little or no value upon completion of that proceeding 
in addition  as dhc locates additional acquisition opportunities  the loss of its cash investment in acl will result in dhc needing to obtain more equity capital and or debt in order to fund any such acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital and or debt will be available to dhc on acceptable terms 
uncertainties relating to bankruptcy proceedings acl s future results are dependent upon successfully obtaining approval  confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization 
acl has not yet submitted such a plan to the bankruptcy court for approval and cannot make any assurance that it will be able to submit and obtain confirmation of any such plan in a timely manner 
failure to confirm a plan in a timely manner could adversely affect acl s operating results  as acl s ability to obtain financing to fund its operations and its relations with its customers may be harmed by protracted bankruptcy proceedings 
moreover  even following confirmation  consummation and implementation of a plan of reorganization  acl s operating results may be harmed by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and customers to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings 
currently  it is not possible to predict with certainty the length of time acl will operate under the protection of chapter  the outcome of the chapter proceedings in general  or the effect of the proceedings on the business of acl or on the interests of the various creditors and stakeholders 
under the priority scheme established by the bankruptcy code  certain post petition liabilities and pre petition liabilities need to be satisfied before equity holders dhc  directly and indirectly  controls of the equity interests in acl can receive any distribution 
the ultimate recovery to dhc  if any  will not be determined until confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
there can be no assurance as to what value  if any  will be ascribed to dhc s equity interests in acl and the other debtors in the bankruptcy proceedings  and the value of such equity interests could be substantially or totally diluted or cancelled 
acl may  under certain circumstances  file motions with the bankruptcy court to assume or reject executory contracts 
an executory contract is one in which the parties have mutual obligations to perform eg  contracts of affreightment  charters  equipment leases and real property leases 
unless otherwise agreed  the assumption of a contract will require acl to cure or provide for the cure of all prior defaults under the related contract  including all pre petition liabilities 
unless otherwise agreed  the rejection of a contract is deemed to constitute a breach of the agreement as of the moment immediately preceding the chapter filing  giving the counter party a right to assert a general unsecured claim for damages arising out of the breach 
additional liabilities subject to the proceedings may arise in the future as a result of the rejection of executory contracts  including leases  and from the determination of the bankruptcy court or agreement by parties in interest of allowed claims for contingencies and other disputed amounts 
conversely  the assumption of executory contracts and unexpired leases may convert liabilities shown as subject to compromise to post petition liabilities 
due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential claims  acl is unable to project the magnitude of such claims with any degree of certainty 
the potential adverse publicity associated with the chapter filing and the resulting uncertainty regarding acl s future prospects may hinder acl s ongoing business activities and its ability to operate  fund and execute its business plan by i impairing relations with existing and potential customers  ii negatively impacting the ability of acl to attract  retain and compensate key executives and associates and to retain employees generally  iii limiting acl s ability to obtain trade credit  iv and impairing present and future relationships with vendors and service providers 
acl has incurred and will continue to incur significant costs associated with the reorganization 
the amount of these costs  which are being expensed as incurred  are expected to have a significant adverse affect on the results of operations and cash flows 
the unsecured creditors committee appointed in the bankruptcy proceedings have the right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court 
there can be no assurance that the unsecured creditors committee will support acl s positions in the bankruptcy proceeding or the plan s of reorganization once proposed  and disagreements between acl and the committee could protract the bankruptcy proceedings  could negatively impact acl s ability to operate during bankruptcy and could delay acl s emergence from bankruptcy 
certain additional risk factors associated with the reorganization include  but are not limited to  the following potential adverse developments with respect to acl s liquidity  results of operations or ability to continue as a going concern  bankruptcy court approval of the motions prosecuted by acl from time to time  the availability of exit financing to facilitate emergence from chapter pursuant to a plan of reorganization  risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval i to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for acl to propose and confirm one or more plans of reorganization  ii for the appointment of a chapter trustee or iii to convert acl s cases to chapter cases for the liquidation of its businesses  and the ability of acl to execute on its business plans 
risks relating to acl s debt obligations acl incurred significant debt in connection with the recapitalization and the danielson recapitalization 
after the recapitalizations  acl experienced lower than expected revenues and earnings due in part to a deteriorating economy and a general slow down in the barging industry 
after failing to complete an out of court financial restructuring alternative  acl was unable to meet its financial obligations as they became due 
consequently  acl filed a petition with the bankruptcy court in order to reorganize its capital and debt structure under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result of the chapter filings  certain events of default under the senior credit facilities  senior notes  pik notes and old senior notes have occurred 
however  under chapter  actions by creditors to collect claims on pre petition debt are stayed or deferred unless specifically ordered by the bankruptcy court 
if and when acl emerges from bankruptcy it is likely that it will continue to be highly leveraged with substantial debt service obligations 
acl s senior credit facilities and other indebtedness could be replaced by new credit facilities with substantial  and possibly more restrictive  covenants 
thus  acl s leveraged position could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  acl s substantial leverage position after bankruptcy could limit acl s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  increase acl s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require acl to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  limit acl s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it competes  and place acl at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors 
potential sale of acl assets in connection with the development of alternative plans of reorganization  acl will evaluate any and all proposals to maximize the value of all acl s stakeholders  including the sale of certain of its remaining business lines 
there can be no assurance that acl will be able to consummate such asset sales or that any asset sales will be at or greater than the current net book value of such assets 
acl s liquidity is dependent on a number of factors acl s liquidity generally depends on cash provided by operating activities and access to the dip credit facility 
the ability of acl to continue as a going concern including its ability to meet post petition obligations and the continued appropriateness of using the going concern basis for its financial statements are dependent upon  among other things  i acl s ability to comply with the covenants of the dip credit facility  ii the ability of acl to maintain adequate cash on hand  iii the ability of acl to continue to generate cash from operations  iv confirmation of a plan of reorganization under the bankruptcy code and the terms of such plan  v ability of acl to attract  retain and compensate key executives and associates and to retain employees generally and vi acl s ability to achieve profitability following such confirmation 
marine services specific risks risks of adverse weather and river conditions acl s barging operations are affected by weather and river conditions 
varying weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice in northern united states river areas 
for example  the upper mississippi river closes annually from approximately mid december to mid march and ice conditions can hamper navigation on the upper reaches of the illinois river during the winter months 
in addition  adverse river conditions affect towboat speed  tow size and loading drafts and can delay barge movements 
lock outages due to lock maintenance and or other interruptions in normal lock operation can also delay barge movements 
jeffboat s waterfront location is subject to occasional flooding 
jeffboat s manufacturing operations that are conducted outdoors are also subject to weather conditions  which may adversely impact production schedules 
terminals may also experience operational interruptions as a result of weather and river conditions 
it is likely that acl s operations will be subject to adverse weather or river conditions in the future and there can be no assurance that such weather or river conditions will not have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
exposure to grain exports acl s dry cargo barging business in north america is significantly affected by the level of grain export volume handled through the gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to  among other things  crop harvest yield levels in the united states and abroad 
overseas grain shortages can increase demand for us grain  while worldwide over production can decrease the demand for us grain 
this variable nature of grain exports can result in temporary barge oversupply which can drive down freight rates 
there can be no assurance that historical levels of north american grain export volume will be maintained in the future and  to the extent supply imbalances were to prevail for a significant period of time  they could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
seasonality acl s business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits historically have been lower during the first and second fiscal quarters of the year january through june and higher during the third and fourth fiscal quarters july through december due to the north american grain harvest 
in addition  working capital requirements fluctuate throughout the year 
adverse market or operating conditions during the last four months of the year could have a greater effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows than during other periods 
variability freight transportation rates may fluctuate from season to season and year to year  which could result in varying levels of cash flow 
the level of dry and liquid cargoes requiring transportation on the inland waterways will vary due to numerous factors  including global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic agricultural production demand as well as international agricultural production demand and the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
in addition  the number of barges and towboats in the overall industry fleet available to transport these cargoes will vary from year to year as older vessels are retired and scrapped and new vessels are constructed and placed into service 
the resulting relationship between available cargoes and available vessels will vary with periods of low vessel availability and high cargo demand causing higher freight rates and periods of high vessel availability and low cargo demand causing lower freight rates 
significant periods of high vessel availability and low cargo demand could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the foregoing factors can also affect market rates 
as contracts expire and terms are renegotiated at then current market rates  the level of revenue can vary relative to prior years 
this has become more evident as the industry has shifted to shorter term contracts 
the impact of these factors could be material and there can be no assurance that the rates at which contracts are renewed will not have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
competition the barge business is highly competitive and there are few significant barriers to entry 
certain of acl s principal competitors have greater financial resources and or are less leveraged than acl and may be better able to withstand and respond to adverse market conditions within the barging industry 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition or results of operations or that acl will not encounter increased competition in the future  which also could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
exposure to international economic and political factors acl s operations may be affected by actions of foreign governments and global or regional economic developments 
for example  global economic events such as foreign import export policy or currency fluctuations  could affect the level of imports and exports 
foreign agricultural subsidies can also impact demand for us agricultural exports 
in addition  foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports and or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the level of cargoes requiring transportation on the inland waterways 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies will raise or lower demand for us exports as well as us demand for foreign produced raw materials and finished good imports 
such actions or developments could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risk of providing services abroad demand for acl s services may be affected by economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which acl provides services 
acl s foreign operations are also subject to other risks of doing business abroad  including fluctuations in the value of currencies which may affect demand for products priced in us dollars as well as local labor and supply costs  import duties  changes to import and export regulations including quotas  possible restrictions on the repatriation of capital and earnings  labor or civil unrest  long payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the burdens and cost of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  changes in citizenship requirements for purposes of doing business and government expropriation of operations and or assets 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of acl or that the political  cultural or economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to acl s operations and growth strategy 
exposure to fuel prices fuel prices are subject to fluctuation as a result of domestic and international events 
there can be no assurance that acl will not experience increased fuel prices in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
replacement needs barge and towboat replacement represents a significant cost for acl  and acl expects to replace barges in and approximately per year during the next four years 
due to the variable nature of the barging industry and the freight transportation industry in general and the relatively long life of marine equipment  it is difficult for acl and other barge companies to accurately predict equipment requirements 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that acl will have sufficient equipment to satisfy market demand or that the industry will not have an oversupply of equipment 
an inability to secure sufficient equipment to satisfy market demand or an oversupply of equipment could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
acl combined operations pursuant to its strategy to pursue synergistic acquisitions in its core business lines  acl may expend substantial management time and financial and other resources for the acquisition and integration of other barging operations 
these acquisitions may pose risks with respect to operations  customer service and customer acceptance 
while acl s management has successfully combined other barging operations and it believes that it has sufficient financial and management resources to accomplish the rationalization and integration of other barging operations  there can be no assurance that such operations can be integrated successfully or that acl will not experience difficulties with customers  personnel or others 
in addition  although acl believes that the other barging operations will enhance the competitive position and business prospects of acl  there can be no assurance that such benefits will be fully realized 
dependence on key personnel acl is dependent on the continued services of its senior management team 
the loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
labor relations although acl believes that its relations with its employees and with the recognized labor unions are generally good  other than for any after effects of the jeffboat strike and the impact of employee layoffs at jeffboat  acl and various acl related entities that are a result of acl s current economic condition there can be no assurance that acl will not be subject to work stoppages or other labor disruption and  if such events were to occur  that there would not be a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental  health and safety requirements acl s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations which  among other things  specify requirements for the management of oil  hazardous wastes  and hazardous substances and impose liability for releases of these materials into the environment 
a release of oil  hazardous waste  hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment at or by acl s properties or vessels  as a result of acl s current or past operations  or at a facility to which acl has shipped wastes  or the existence of historical contamination at any of its properties  could result in material liability to acl 
acl has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to the cleanup of certain waste disposal sites 
federal  state and local governments could in the future enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that affect acl s operations or facilities  increase its costs of operation  or adversely affect the demand for its services 
acl cannot predict the effect that such future laws or regulations could have on acl 
nor can acl predict what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its current or past facilities or at other properties where acl or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of wastes and the extent of liability that may result from the discovery of such conditions 
it is possible that such future laws or undiscovered conditions could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
acl s domestic vessel operations are primarily regulated by the us coast guard for occupational health and safety standards 
acl s domestic shore operations are subject to the us occupational safety and health administration regulations 
there can be no assurance that claims will not be made against acl for work related illness or injury  or that the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which acl operates will not adversely affect its business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other government regulation acl s barging operations are subject to various laws and regulations  including international treaties  conventions  national  state and local laws and regulations and the laws and regulations of the flag nations of acl s vessels  all of which are subject to amendment or changes in interpretation 
further  acl is required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain and or maintain certain permits  licenses and certificates respecting its operations 
acl s domestic towboats are in certain circumstances subject to a significant federal fuel use tax  which may be increased 
any significant changes in laws or regulations affecting acl s operations  or in the interpretation thereof  could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
terrorist attacks  war and the risk of war the impact that terrorist attacks  such as those carried out on september   may have on the marine transportation industry in general  and on acl in particular  is not known at this time 
such attacks  and the uncertainty surrounding them  may impact acl s operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of rail lines  highways and fuel supplies and the possibility that acl s facilities and vessels could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 
in addition  war or risk of war may also have an adverse effect on the economy 
a decline in economic activity could adversely affect acl s revenues or restrict acl s future growth 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect acl s ability to raise capital 
such attacks may lead to increased volatility in fuel costs and availability and could affect acl s results of operations 
in addition  the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverages acl currently maintains could increase dramatically  or the coverages could be unavailable in the future 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on acl s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
small number of customers account for a substantial portion of acl s revenues in  acl s largest customer  cargill  inc  accounted for more than of acl s revenues  while acl s largest customers accounted for approximately of acl s revenues 
insurance services specific risks competition the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition from many competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources that naicc 
there can be no assurance that naicc will be able to successfully compete in these markets and generate sufficient premium volume at attractive prices to be profitable 
this risk is enhanced by the reduction in the lines of business naicc writes as a result of it decision to reduce underwriting operations 
insurance regulations the insurance industry is highly regulated and it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulations on the operations of naicc 
loss experience unpaid loss and lae are based on estimates of reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for reinsurance assumed from such insurers  and historical company experience for unreported claims 
such liability is  by necessity  based on estimates that may change in the near term 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed  or even materially exceed  such estimated amount included herein 
capital adequacy and risk based capital naicc is subject to certain regulatory risk based capital rbc requirements 
depending on its rbc  naicc could be subject to four levels of increasing regulatory intervention ranging from company action to mandatory control 
naicc s capital is also one factor used to determine its ability to distribute or loan funds to dhc 
dhc specific risks inability to use net loss tax carryforwards one of dhc s significant assets is its net loss tax carryforwards 
in order to utilize those assets  dhc must generate taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the asset is also utilized by income from certain grantor trusts that were established as part of the mission organization 
the carryforwards will expire if not used 
the carryforwards further would be substantially reduced if dhc were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
dhc will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a increase in stock ownership during a three year testing period by stockholders

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and significant events dhc is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
dhc s parent only operations consist primarily of investment return on portfolio securities and limited administrative and operating expenses  which are not material to dhc on a consolidated basis 
dhc possesses approximately million of tax net operating loss carryforwards 
dhc s strategic and business plan is to acquire businesses that will allow dhc to earn an attractive return on its investment 
prior to  dhc primarily engaged in the insurance services business through naicc and related entities insurance services 
in may  as part of dhc s implementation of its strategic plan  dhc acquired a ownership interest in acl and thereby entered the marine transportation  construction and related service provider businesses marine services 
the marine services business is substantially larger than dhc s historical insurance services business  which results in significant changes to dhc s consolidated financial statements for approximately of dhc s consolidated revenues  expenses and assets relate to its newly acquired marine services business and approximately relate to its historical insurance services business 
as discussed in detail in item of this report  the marine services business has experienced material financial problems subsequent to being acquired by dhc 
acl and the other debtors filed a chapter bankruptcy proceeding on january   and material uncertainty exists as to its impact on dhc s equity interest in acl upon the conclusion of acl s bankruptcy proceeding 
while it cannot presently be determined  dhc s investment in acl may have little or no value upon the completion of that bankruptcy proceeding 
if the value of dhc s investment in acl is materially reduced or eliminated  dhc s consolidated financial results would then again be predominantly based upon its historical insurance services business until such time as dhc may be successful in acquiring other businesses 
accordingly  dhc believes that an analysis of dhc s consolidated financial condition taken as a whole is not meaningful to investors at this time  but rather that the appropriate analysis must be focused on its separate and distinct marine services and insurance services businesses 
dhc believes that this separate analysis of its operating subsidiaries allows for both a more consistent comparison of results with that of prior years and will provide a more direct basis for comparison in future years in the event that dhc effectively exits the marine services business as a result of the acl bankruptcy proceedings 
therefore  the following discussion of dhc s financial condition and operating results primarily describes the condition  results  operations and outlook of each of its businesses on a separate basis 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the financial condition and results of operations of dhc s separate business lines will impact dhc s available capital resources that will be needed for dhc to expand through acquisitions 
the net effect of the operations of dhc s subsidiaries on dhc s liquidity is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
marine services overview and significant events acl acquisition and investment in gms  gmsv and vessel leasing on may   dhc consummated a rights offering to provide funds for the acquisition of acl and related entities as discussed below

acl s chapter filing as also discussed in this report at item  business marine services acl bankruptcy considerations  during and the beginning of  acl experienced a decline in barging rates  reduced shipping volumes and excess barging capacity during a period of slow economic growth and a global economic recession 
due to these factors  acl s revenues and earnings did not meet expectations and acl s liquidity was significantly impaired and it was unable to comply with its various debt covenants 
as a result  acl was unable to meet its financial obligations as they became due 
on january   acl and the other debtors filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
the chapter petitions do not cover any of acl s foreign subsidiaries or certain of its us subsidiaries 
dhc did not file for chapter protection and is not a party to any proceedings under the bankruptcy code 
acl as well as its other debtor in possession subsidiaries is continuing to operate its business as a debtor in possession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code and orders of the bankruptcy court 
as a debtor in possession  acl may not engage in transactions outside of the ordinary course of business without approval  after hearing  of the bankruptcy court 
as part of the chapter cases  acl intends to develop and propose for confirmation pursuant to chapter a plan of reorganization that will restructure the operations and liabilities of acl to the extent necessary to result in the continuing viability of acl 
a filing date for such a plan has not been determined by acl  however  acl has the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization during the day period following the petition date 
if the exclusive period were to expire without being extended  other parties  such as the creditors of acl  would have the right to propose alternative plans for reorganization 
in connection with the chapter filings  acl received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay or otherwise honor certain of its pre petition obligations  including but not limited to employee wages and certain employee benefits  certain critical vendor payments  certain insurance and claim obligations  and certain tax obligations  as a plan of reorganization is developed 
furthermore  acl entered into the dip credit facility that provides up to million of financing 
as of march   participating bank commitments under the dip credit facility total million  of which acl has drawn million  which was used to retire acl s pre petition receivables facility as hereinafter defined and which continues to be used to fund acl s day to day cash needs 
the dip credit facility is secured by the same and additional assets that collateralized the acl senior credit facilities as hereinafter defined and the acl pre petition receivables facility  and bears interest  at acl s option  at libor plus four percent or an alternate base rate as defined in the dip credit facility plus three percent 
there are also certain interest rates in the event of a default under the dip credit facility 
the dip credit facility also contains certain restrictive covenants that  among other things  restrict the debtors ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee the obligations of others 
acl is also required to maintain minimum cumulative ebitda  as defined in the dip credit facility  and limit its capital expenditures 
as a result of the chapter filings  certain events of default under the acl senior credit facilities  senior notes  pik notes and old senior notes as hereinafter defined have occurred subsequent to december   the effects of which are stayed pursuant to certain provisions of the bankruptcy code 
under chapter  actions by creditors to collect claims in existence at the filing date are stayed or deferred absent specific bankruptcy court authorization to pay such pre petition claims while acl continues to manage its business as a debtor in possession and acts to develop a plan of reorganization for the purpose of emerging from the chapter proceedings 
the amount of the claims to be filed against acl by their creditors could be significantly different than the amount of the liabilities recorded by acl 
acl also has numerous executory contracts and other agreements that could be assumed or rejected during the chapter proceedings 
parties affected by these rejections may file claims with the bankruptcy court in accordance with the reorganization process 
under these chapter proceedings  the rights of and ultimate payments to pre petition creditors  rejection damage claimants and equity investors in acl which dhc controls through its ownership of aclines which owns of the interests in acl s parent  acl holdings may be substantially altered 
this could result in claims being liquidated in the chapter proceedings at less possible substantially less than of their face value  and the membership interests of acl  which are indirectly  wholly owned by dhc  being substantially or totally diluted or cancelled 
the united states trustee has appointed an unsecured creditors committee 
the official committee and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court 
since dhc controls all of the equity of acl  it and its counsel are closely monitoring and are involved in the acl chapter proceedings as appropriate for an equity holder 
the chapter process presents inherent material uncertainty 
it is not possible to determine the additional amount of claims that may arise or ultimately be filed  or predict i the length of time that the debtors will continue to operate under the protection of chapter  ii the outcome of the chapter proceedings in general  iii whether the debtors will continue to operate in their present organizational structure  or iv the effects of the proceedings on the business of acl  the other debtors and its non filing subsidiaries and affiliates  or on the interests of the various creditors  security holders and equity holders 
the ultimate recovery  if any  by creditors  security holders and acl equity holders controlled and indirectly wholly owned by dhc will not be determined until confirmation of a plan or plans of reorganization 
no assurance can be given as to what value  if any  will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies  including dhc s equity interest in acl  which could be substantially or totally diluted or cancelled 
pre bankruptcy financial restructuring of acl through may   acl was in default under its bank and bond debt  as well as its receivables facility  due to nonpayment of interest on the debt as well as other covenant violations 
on december   and subsequent thereto  acl elected not to pay the interest due on its bank and bond debt due to ongoing negotiations with its bankers and note holders regarding the restructuring of the debt 
acl obtained forbearance agreements or waivers which enabled it to complete the danielson recapitalization and the debt restructuring described below 
acl s original secured debt was issued pursuant to the old senior credit facilities 
acl also had outstanding million of old senior notes 
on march   acl entered into a definitive recapitalization agreement regarding the acquisition of acl by danielson 
on april   acl launched an exchange offer pursuant to which acl offered to exchange the old senior notes for new senior notes and new pik notes 
on april   acl and certain lenders executed an amendment agreement under which the old senior credit facilities would be amended and restated upon the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the amendment agreement  including the consummation of the danielson recapitalization 
effective may   the danielson recapitalization was consummated with million of the old senior notes and interest thereon  if any  contributed by danielson to acl holdings  million  plus accrued interest  of the remaining million in old senior notes exchanged for new senior notes  and new pik notes and the senior credit facilities amended 
as part of the danielson recapitalization  dhc contributed million in cash to acl holdings  which was immediately used to reduce the outstanding term loan debt under the senior credit facilities 
in addition  million of the amount outstanding under the old revolving credit facility was converted into a new term loan 
dhc is neither an obligor nor guarantor of any of indebtedness or other obligations of acl  acl holdings  gms  gmsv or vessel leasing 
as of may   after the million reduction in outstanding old term loans  and after the million old revolving credit facility conversion to a tranche a term loan  acl s secured debt issued under the amended senior credit facilities consisted of a million tranche a term loan due june   a million tranche b term loan due june   a million tranche c term loan due june  and the new revolving credit facility providing for revolving loans and the issuance of letters of credit for the account of acl in an aggregate principal amount of up to million due june  as of december   the outstanding balance under the term loans was million and the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was million in cash borrowings and million in letters of credit 
the term loans bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus a margin based on acl s performance 
the annual interest rates as of december  were tranche a  tranche b  and tranche c 
acl also had outstanding principal of million in new senior notes and million in new pik notes as of december  million in principal of the old senior notes remain outstanding 
the senior notes and pik notes are unsecured 
also effective may   acl s receivables facility  which was administered by pnc bank  na  was replaced with a receivables purchase agreement among american commercial lines funding corporation  acbl  jupiter securitization corporation and bank one  na the pre petition receivables facility having substantially the same terms as the previous receivables facility 
the pre petition receivables facility was retired by acl on january  with funds from the dip credit facility 
pre bankruptcy strike at acl s marine construction subsidiary on july   jeffboat  acl s marine construction subsidiary  and its unionized employees represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters  local no 
 agreed upon a new collective bargaining agreement  ending a two month long strike 
the previous collective bargaining agreement had expired on april  and the unionized employees chose to strike from april  until july   when they returned to work pursuant to the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement 
additional acl financial restructuring prior to bankruptcy and acl chapter filing as discussed in this report at item  business marine services acl bankruptcy considerations  in response to weak market and poor economic conditions during and the beginning of  and because of acl s highly leveraged position  acl filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
prior to the chapter filing  acl had been pursuing other financial restructuring alternatives  which are described below 
acl s senior credit facilities and the indentures governing the senior notes and the pik notes the indentures contain a number of covenants with specified financial ratios and tests including  with respect to the senior credit facilities  maximum leverage ratios  rent adjusted maximum leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios 
compliance with financial ratios is measured at the end of each quarter 
the indentures also contain certain cross default provisions 
acl s ability to meet the financial ratios is affected by adverse weather conditions  seasonality and other risk factors inherent in its business 
the senior credit facilities also contain provisions which require mandatory prepayments of the term loans with net proceeds from certain asset sales  equity issuances  incurrence of indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions  as well as certain excess cash flow 
in late  acl received a notification from bank one stating that acl was in violation of the cross default provisions contained in the pre petition receivables facility  which provides that a failure to maintain the financial ratios provided by the credit agreement  whether or not amended or waived  constitutes a default under the pre petition receivables facility 
subsequent to the notice of default  bank one and acl agreed to an amendment to the receivables facility which permitted acl to continue utilizing the receivables facility  although the loss reserve and certain facility fees were increased and the termination date changed from may  to january  subsequent to the notice of default from bank one  acl obtained an amendment the amendment of certain covenants under the senior credit facilities  relating to third quarter and fourth quarter covenants and a waiver of any past violations thereof 
absent the amendment  acl would not have been in compliance with the leverage or interest coverage ratios contained in its senior credit facilities as of december  at the end of the first quarter of  the covenant ratios revert to levels in effect before the amendment 
although acl management had been working on operating and financial plans to comply with its debt covenants in and thereafter  acl was unable to complete an out of court restructuring and acl management believed it was probable that acl would not be in compliance with the covenants in the senior credit facilities at the end of the first quarter  absent another amendment to the senior credit facilities 
on december   acl elected to exercise its rights under the indentures to postpone the interest payments due on the senior notes and old senior notes for thirty days 
acl did not make the interest payments within the thirty day grace period 
this resulted in an event of default under the senior credit facilities and the pre petition receivables facility 
acl continued to attempt to complete an out of court restructuring during this grace period 
as a result of the factors discussed above  acl was unable to meet its financial obligations as they became due and acl filed for chapter under the bankruptcy code on january  and is currently operating as a debtor in possession under the bankruptcy code 
acl is funding its operations with normal cash flows from operations and with proceeds from and access to the dip credit facility 
insurance services overview and significant events written premium increases on naicc s non standard and commercial auto insurance lines on july   naicc  dhc s primary operating insurance subsidiary  decided to increase the aggregate net written premium run rate of its non standard private passenger automobile insurance in the state of california and commercial automobile insurance in certain western states  including california  from million to million 
this decision was intended to capitalize on favorable loss ratios occurring in naicc s automobile insurance lines and to solidify the distribution network of naicc s products 
impact of acl bankruptcy on naicc statutory accounting as discussed further in this report at item  business marine services acl bankruptcy considerations  acl filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
as a result  it was determined for statutory insurance accounting purposes that naicc s investment in acl was fully impaired 
at december   naicc recognized a statutory charge to its surplus of million 
this charge  when combined with naicc s underwriting results reduced it s statutory surplus level below the company action level of naicc s risk based capital calculation 
in response to the above statutory condition  dhc repaid the million note due may to naicc  and further contributed million to naicc to increase its statutory capital during february with permission from the california department of insurance  these transactions were recorded at december  after consideration for the million noted above  naicc s reported capital and surplus as of december  was above the company action level of naicc s rbc calculation 
taxes dhc does not currently pay regular federal income tax due to its net operating loss carryforwards and the recognition of losses from several trusts that assumed various liabilities of certain present and former subsidiaries of dhc 
it is expected that dhc s consolidated federal income tax return will report a cumulative net operating loss carryforward currently estimated at million  which will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and exclusive of the trusts activities  dhc has generated cumulative taxable losses both historically and during the prior three years 
over the past several years  dhc s insurance operations have been generating losses exclusive of net investment income  net realized gains and the trusts activities 
in  dhc generated income at the holding company level due to the gain recognized from adjusting the acl notes to fair value prior to and in connection with the danielson recapitalization 
prior to  dhc has historically generated losses at the holding company level 
therefore  these tax loss attributes are currently fully reserved in dhc s financial statements

operating revenue 
on a pro forma basis  marine services revenue declined million or for the year as compared to the revenue decrease was primarily due to lower domestic barging freight rates and volumes and the strike at jeffboat  partially offset by higher sales at jeffboat when revenue from the sale of barges to vessel leasing is excluded and increased revenue from acl s international business units 
domestic barging revenue decreased million to million due to lower barging rates for grain  bulk  coal and liquid freight  lower liquid freight volume  lower coal freight volume  lower demurrage revenue and lower towing revenue  partially offset by increased grain freight volumes primarily due to better operating conditions in the first half of the year and increased bulk freight volume as a result of increased demand in the last six months of the year 
international barging revenue increased million to million primarily due to increased revenue from acl s dominican republic unit which began operation in the third quarter of  a new operation in venezuela to move bauxite tonnage during the low water navigation season and the sale of logistics services to a third party barge operator in venezuela to transport equipment from the united states to venezuela 
the increase was partially offset by the absence of payments for minimum contract tonnage in venezuela 
revenue at jeffboat increased million to due to increased sales of dry cargo hoppers  partially offset by reduced sales of tank barges 
in  million of jeffboat revenue was from the sale of hoppers to vessel leasing 
this revenue has been eliminated in the pro forma operating information because vessel leasing is now consolidated with acl 
terminals revenue increased million due to the start of the gmsv operation in and higher cargo handling revenue from gms  partially offset by lower revenue from acl s terminal in venezuela  lower revenue from acl s liquid transfer and storage facility and lower storage revenue from gms 
operating expense 
on a pro forma basis  marine services operating expense increased million or 
consulting and legal fees of million incurred by the marine services operations in  primarily as a result of the danielson recapitalization  are included in the pro forma results 
domestic barging expenses increased million to million due to lower gains on property dispositions  higher consulting and legal fees primarily associated with the danielson recapitalization  and higher equipment repair expense  partially offset by reduced fuel prices  lower barge freight volume  better operating conditions in the first half of and lower boat depreciation expense due to a change in the estimated useful life of towboats 
average fuel price before user tax decreased cents per gallon to cents per gallon on a volume of million gallons 
international barging expenses increased million to million primarily due to expenses associated with providing logistics services to a third party barge operator in venezuela  an increase in expenses from acl s dominican republic unit  which began operation in the third quarter of and additional expenses associated with operations during low water periods in venezuela 
jeffboat s expenses increased million to million due to increased dry cargo hopper production  partially offset by reduced tank barge production 
terminals expense increased million to million due to the start of the gmsv operation  higher labor cost from gms due to increased cargo handling volumes and increased medical insurance expense 
insurance services year ended december  compared with year ended december  the operations of dhc s insurance subsidiary  naicc  are primarily property and casualty insurance 
the results discussed below exclude naicc s share of any undistributed earnings related to its proportional ownership of aclines 
naicc s objective is to underwrite business that is expected to yield an underwriting profit 
during  naicc determined that certain lines of business were unsustainable in the current rate environment 
competitive and regulatory pressures have resulted in a general market for premium rates in those lines that is well below a level necessary to achieve a profit  especially in light of increasingly unfavorable loss development 
rather than continuing writing those lines that are likely to sustain higher than expected losses  in naicc exited both the workers compensation line of insurance in all states  and also the private passenger lines of insurance outside of california 
the last workers compensation policy outside montana was issued in july and the last montana workers compensation policy was issued in january the remaining lines of insurance written by naicc in are private passenger automobile in california and commercial automobile in certain western states  primarily california 
costs incurred in attributable to the contraction process were approximately million and include the write off of goodwill and employees severances 
net premiums earned were million in as compared to million in the change in net premiums earned during those years is directly related to the change in net premiums written 
net written premiums were million and million in and  respectively 
net earned premiums exceeded net written premiums in due to the decision to cease writing in several lines of business as noted above 
the overall decrease in net written premium for over the comparable period in is attributable to significant reduction in our commercial automobile line and the decision made in to exit both the workers compensation line of business in all states and private passenger automobile outside of california 
workers compensation net written premium decreased by million during over the comparable period in the commercial automobile net written premium decreased from million in to million in due to curtailed underwriting activity 
net written premiums for personal automobile lines increased by million during primarily due to premium growth in the non standard california private passenger automobile programs in excess of the decline in net written premium outside of california 
premium and fees receivable  net of allowances  decreased by million or 
the decrease is attributable to the decision to significantly reduce naicc s underwriting operations 
prior to that decision  naicc experienced significant growth in installment premiums related to its commercial automobile program during naicc s automobile programs have installment features on policy terms in excess of six months 
premiums from the automobile program that generally offer policy terms less than six months and do not utilize installment plans increased in the effect of these trends was to magnify the overall decrease in installment premium receivable during the increase in the allowance for premiums and fees receivable during of million was attributable to the increase in installment premiums during prior to the decision to contract underwriting operations in the commercial automobile line 
in conjunction with the increase in installment premiums during  naicc experienced an increase in collection efforts relating to such premiums 
as a result  naicc increased both its allowance for premiums and the amount written off against such allowance during net investment income was million in compared to million in the net investment income decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio 
the fixed income invested asset portfolio decreased by million in compared to an increase of million in the decrease during is attributable to the conversion of million of acl notes into equity in addition to maturities and pay downs 
as a result of the decrease in written premiums noted above  maturities and pay downs were not reinvested at the same level as in as of december  and  the average yield on naicc s portfolio was and  respectively 
the estimated average duration of the portfolio at december  is years compared to at december  a realized investment gain of million was recognized in upon conversion of the acl notes into equity 
this gain  combined with a million loss on non affiliated equity securities and a million gain on fixed maturities produced a net realized investment gain of million in net realized investment losses on non affiliated equity securities during were principally a result of deteriorating portfolio fair values deemed to be other than temporary 
realized losses of million were recorded for other than temporary declines in fair value in of the equity securities of three companies 
naicc s investments in two of these companies were sold in subsequent to the recording of the other than temporary decline 
the net unrealized loss on naicc s equity portfolio was million at the end of december naicc s equity portfolio which consists primarily of small and midcap technology companies  declined significantly during the last half of net realized gains on non affiliated equity securities were million during realized gains in reflected strong valuations consistent with the general economic trend for that period 
net losses and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred were million in compared to million in the resulting net loss and lae ratios were in and in the increase in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to higher than expected losses in the california private passenger automobile and commercial automobile programs totaling million and million  respectively 
in addition  naicc had significant adverse development in the california workers compensation line and non california private passenger automobile 
adverse development on prior accident years recognized for workers compensation in was million 
the adverse development for prior accident years related to the private passenger automobile lines placed in run off was million 
adverse development on prior accident years recognized for workers compensation in totaled million 
the adverse development for prior accident years related to the private passenger automobile lines placed in run off was million 
policy acquisition costs were million in compared to million in as a percent of net premiums earned  policy acquisition expenses were in and in policy acquisition costs include expenses which are directly related to premium volume ie  commissions  premium taxes and state assessments as well as certain underwriting expenses which are fixed in nature 
the decrease in the policy acquisition expense ratio in  compared to  is due to a reduction of acquisition costs of million primarily as the result of the decision in to exit those lines mentioned above 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in general and administrative expenses have decreased in due to decreased production and previously implemented cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses in also include million in amortization of goodwill expense 
as a percent of net premiums earned  general and administrative expenses were in and in the decrease in reflects decreased production in and the effect of cost saving measures implemented during the ratio includes an additional million of costs associated with the decision to contract naicc s underwriting operations 
those costs included employee severance payments of approximately million and a write off of goodwill of approximately million 
these costs added to the ratio 
combined underwriting ratios were and in and  respectively 
the combined ratio decrease in reflects reductions in both policy acquisition and administrative expenses  that was partially offset by an increase in loss and lae during compared to the insurance operations had a loss  excluding any effect of its investment in aclines  llc  an affiliate  and excluding the million gain from conversion of acl notes to equity  of million in compared to a loss of million in the increase in loss from operations compared to is the result of realized losses on the equity portfolio  offset by million gain on sales of fixed income securities in as compared to a gain on equity portfolio sales of million in that negated the impact of the improvement in the combined ratio during noted above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  parent company only administrative expense and danielson interest expense administrative expense 
parent company administrative expense increased million to million for the year ending december as compared to million for the year ending december the increase is primarily due to expense for stock options  which were modified as of july   one time increases in management compensation related to the resignation of certain dhc management in connection with its acquisition of acl  higher directors fees and additional insurance expense 
prior to the acquisition of acl and shortly thereafter  dhc shared certain personnel and facilities with several affiliated and unaffiliated companies who have certain common directors and officers  and certain expenses were allocated among the various entities 
personnel costs were allocated based upon actual time spent on dhc business 
costs relating to office space and equipment were allocated based upon actual usage 
management believes the methodology used for allocation is appropriate 
total expenses include million in and million in related to expenses allocated to dhc from affiliated entities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ending december as compared to no interest expense for the year ending december primarily due to acl s and gms interest expense after the acquisition 
other expense income 
parent company gains on investments increased to million for the year ending december as compared to million for the year ending december due to recognition of million in gain on acl bonds owned by dhc that were contributed as part of the purchase price of acl holdings 
the remaining million gain on investments in was due to the sale of home product bonds during the fourth quarter and is included in net  other expense income

competitive and regulatory pressures have resulted in a general market for premium rates in these lines that is well below a level necessary in order to achieve a profit  especially in light of increasingly unfavorable loss history 
rather than continue to sustain losses  naicc exited the workers compensation line of insurance in all states  and also exited the non standard private passenger automobile program written outside of california 
the last workers compensation policy outside montana was issued in july and the last montana workers compensation policy was issued in january the last new non standard private passenger automobile policy outside of california was issued in september the remaining lines of insurance written by naicc will be non standard private passenger automobile in california and commercial automobile in certain western states  primarily california 
net premiums earned were million in compared to million in the change in net premiums earned was directly related to the change in net written premiums 
net written premiums were million in compared to million in net earned premiums exceeded net written premiums in due to the decision to cease writing in several lines of business as noted above 
the overall increase in net written premiums in was attributable to growth in the commercial automobile insurance business  especially during the first nine months of however  in keeping with naicc s objective of underwriting only business that is expected to yield an underwriting profit  naicc  beginning in september  initiated efforts to reduce the overall commercial automobile premium production through a temporary moratorium on new business  eliminating certain states and terminating agency appointments 
workers compensation net written premiums decreased by million during over the comparable year to date period in due to decreased production  primarily in california 
the commercial automobile net written premiums grew from million in to million in due to increased production  primarily in california 
net written premiums for personal automobile insurance decreased during primarily due to the termination of certain private passenger automobile programs as noted above 
premiums and fees receivable  net of allowances  decreased by million or 
the decrease is attributable to the decision to reduce naicc s underwriting operations 
prior to that decision  naicc experienced significant growth in installment premiums related to its commercial automobile program 
naicc s automobile programs have installment features on policy terms in excess of six months 
premiums from the automobile program that generally offer policy terms less than six months and do not utilize installment plans increased slightly in the effect of these trends was to mitigate the overall decrease in installment premium receivable during the increase in the allowance for premiums and fees receivable during of million was attributable to the increase in installment premiums during prior to the decision to decrease underwriting operations 
in conjunction with the increase in installment premiums  naicc experienced an increase in collection efforts relating to such premiums  especially non standard private passenger automobile policies outside of california 
as a result  naicc increased both its allowance for premiums and the amount of write offs against such allowance 
net investment income was million in compared to million in as of december  and  the average yield on naicc s portfolio was and  respectively 
net investment income remained flat despite the decrease in the portfolio yield due to the write off of million of accrued interest related to the investment in acl senior notes  which were in default at december  had the write off not been required the portfolio yield would have been 
the fixed income invested assets increased by only million in compared to an increase of million in the relatively flat activity during this year is attributable to maturities and paydowns in excess of purchases in the fourth quarter of million 
the estimated average duration of the portfolio at december  was years compared to years at december  net losses and lae were million in compared to million in the resulting net loss and lae ratios were in and in the increase in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to higher than expected losses in the non california private passenger automobile programs  and significant adverse development in the california workers compensation line

total expenses allocated to dhc from affiliated entities were million for both of the years and outlook marine services domestic barging demand for bulk  steel and liquid commodities is expected to remain at levels for the first half of the domestic barging demand for grain freight is driven by the supply of and demand for corn and other grains 
the us department of agriculture currently forecasts crop year corn exports of billion bushels and sparks company inc a private grain forecast service predicts crop year exports of billion bushels as compared to actual exports of billion bushels for the crop year 
in the first quarter of  the average price of fuel consumed by acbl vessels is expected to increase per gallon from the 
per gallon average price for acbl vessels will consume approximately million gallons annually and generally ratably throughout the year 
acbl has contract price adjustment clauses which provide protection for approximately of gallons consumed 
contract adjustments are deferred one quarter 
in march  acl made a forward fuel purchase and purchased an option to protect from fuel price increases on substantially all of its expected fuel consumption during the second quarter of acl management expects that normal cash flows from operations and access to the dip credit facility will be sufficient to meet planned working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements until such time as it seeks to obtain approval for a plan of reorganization 
however  due to material uncertainties associated with the outcome of the chapter proceedings in general  and the effects of such proceedings on the business of acl and its subsidiaries  there can be no assurances that such plan will be approved or whether acl will obtain sufficient liquidity enabling it to continue to operate in its present organizational structure 
insurance services naicc management expects that the business environment in california will remain neutral and competitive 
the effect of the decision in to exit certain lines of business  as expected  was a substantial reduction in the underwriting operations of naicc in evidenced by a reduction in net written premium 
however  this reduced premium activity did not have the desired impact of improving overall profitability as the loss and loss adjustment costs associated with the lines placed into run off during exceeded estimates 
as a result  naicc expects a further reduction of premium volume during management is continually evaluating its filed rates and expects to file adjustments as needed 
cost reductions initiated in and should mitigate the impact of the expected premium reduction 
naicc is experiencing a condition in which claim payments related to the lines placed into run off exceed premium receipts from those lines 
management expects the trend in negative cash flow to continue for several years until premium growth in the remaining lines of business becomes sufficient to support operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the same period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes continuity of acl s operations and realization of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
the financial statements do not give effect to any adjustment to the carrying value of assets or amounts and adjustments of liabilities that might be necessary as a result of the acl chapter filing 
critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities on a going concern basis include revenue recognition  expense estimates of harbor and towing service charges  insurance claim loss deductibles and employee benefit plans  impairment of long lived assets  asset capitalization  loss reserves and investment valuation 
certain of these policies are critical to the portrayal of danielson s financial condition and results of operations since they require management to establish estimates based on complex and subjective judgments 
the primary source of marine services revenue  barge transportation revenue  is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the proportion of barge transportation revenue to be recognized is determined by applying a percentage to the contractual charges for such services 
the percentage is determined by dividing the number of miles from the loading point to the position of the barge as of the end of the accounting period by the total miles from the loading point to the barge destination as specified in the customer s freight contract 
the position of the barge at accounting period end is determined by locating the position of the boat with the barge in tow through use of a global positioning system 
the recognition of revenue based upon the percent of voyage completion results in a better matching of revenue and expenses 
marine construction  repair and harbor service revenue is recognized based upon the completed contract method 
losses are accrued if construction costs are expected to exceed construction contract revenue 
terminal revenue is recognized as services are performed 
harbor and towing service charges are estimated as service incidents occur based upon recent historical charges by vendor for the same type of service event 
service events are recorded by vendor and location in acl s barge tracking system 
vendor charges are estimated for these events based on current published vendor rates 
vendor charges can vary based upon the number of boat hours required to complete the service  the grouping of barges in vendor tows and the quantity of man hours and materials required 
dhc management believes it has recorded sufficient liabilities for these services 
changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on acl s financial results 
liabilities for insurance claim loss deductibles include accruals for the uninsured portion of personal injury  property damage  cargo damage and accident claims 
these accruals are estimated based upon historical experience with similar claim incidents 
the estimates are recorded upon the first report of a claim and are updated as new information is obtained 
the amount of the liability is based on the type and severity of the claim and an estimate of future claim development based on current trends and historical data 
dhc management believes it has recorded sufficient liabilities for these claim incidents 
these claims are subject to significant uncertainty related to the results of negotiated settlements and other developments 
as claims develop  dhc may have to change its estimates and these changes could have a significant impact on dhc s consolidated financial statements 
assets and liabilities of dhc s defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  and discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized  impacting dhc s results of operations 
the liability for post retirement medical and life insurance benefits is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs will affect the recorded amount of post retirement benefits expense  impacting dhc s results of operations 
acl is self insured for the medical benefit plans covering most of its employees 
dhc estimates its liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to acl s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the validity of the lag factor is evaluated periodically and revised if necessary 
although management believes the current estimated liabilities for medical claims are reasonable  changes in the lag in reporting claims  changes in claims experience  unusually large claims  and other factors could materially affect the recorded liabilities and expense  impacting financial condition and results of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas gives companies the choice to account for stock based compensation using either the fair value method or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
danielson has elected to account for its stock option plans using the intrinsic value method 
because most of the options granted to employees and directors under those plans have had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  only minimal stock based compensation cost due to modifications had been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for those options 
in  options granted to contractors resulted in more significant expense being recognized under sfas had dhc elected to account for all of its stock option grants using the fair value method of sfas  or if accounting rules change to require accounting different than the intrinsic value method  dhc s results of operations could be materially affected
