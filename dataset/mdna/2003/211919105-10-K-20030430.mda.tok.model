intel and the nba hold no ownership interest in convera as of january  all references in this form k to financial results for the company for the period prior to december  reflect the historical financial results of excalibur and its subsidiaries 

table of contents critical accounting policies convera s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
convera does not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the company 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases those estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs  income taxes and litigation  on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
convera believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition convera s recognition of revenues requires judgment  particularly in the areas of collectibility and whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time the sales are made 
the company bases its judgment on a variety of factors  including the payment and other terms of the individual customer contracts  credit history of the customer  prior dealings with specific customers  and certain other factors 
if the company determines that the price under the contract is fixed and determinable  and that collectibility is assured  then the company recognizes revenue related to the software license at the time of sale 
to the extent the company determines that the price of a sales agreement is not fixed  the company delays revenue recognition until payments under the contract become due 
alternatively  to the extent the company determines that the collection of payments under the contract is not assured  the company delays revenue recognition until the payments under the contract are received 
thus  the assessment as to whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time of sale and that the fees are collectible is critical in determining the extent of the revenue recognized in a given period 
the revenue associated with other elements of the contract  such as maintenance or training and implementation services  are deferred and recognized as those elements are delivered 
generally  the company receives payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are non refundable 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
customization work is sometimes required to ensure that the company s software functionality meets the requirements of its customers 
in those instances where the company s revenues are generated from fixed price contracts related to this customization work  then revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these cost estimates underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
provision for doubtful accounts convera maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances 
management analyzes specific account balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer  as well as historical bad debts and current economic trends to assess the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents to the extent convera does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent convera does not accurately estimate its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets convera s acquisitions of other companies typically result in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
during the fiscal year ended january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
any goodwill resulting from such acquisitions is associated with the company s corporate reporting unit  since the company does not have multiple reporting units 
the impairment of goodwill is assessed on an annual basis or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value 
this assessment is performed by comparing the market value of the company s outstanding common stock with the carrying amount of the company s net assets 
if the market value exceeds the carrying amount of the company s net assets  impairment of goodwill does not exist 
if the market value is less than the carrying amount of the company s net assets  the company will perform further analysis and may be required to record an impairment 
the company evaluates all of its long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
during the fiscal year ended january   prior to the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 convera determined that the goodwill and certain intangible assets associated primarily with the combination were impaired  and convera recorded a charge of approximately million related to that impairment 
deferred taxes convera records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income 
if the estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit or a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
as of january   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
stock option accounting sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  allows companies to account for stock based compensation either under the provisions of sfas no 
or under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

the company has elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the company s stock option plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant
