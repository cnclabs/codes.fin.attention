overview we are a leading provider of physical intellectual property components for the design and manufacture of complex integrated circuits including those known as system on a chip integrated circuits 
our products include embedded memory  standard cell  input output components and analog and mixed signal products  which are designed to achieve the best combination of performance  density  power and yield for a given manufacturing process 
our intellectual property components are pre tested by producing them in silicon to ensure that they perform to specification 
this enables designers to reduce the risk of design failure and gain valuable time to market 
we license our products to customers for the design and manufacture of integrated circuits used in complex  high volume applications such as portable computing devices  communication systems  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers  workstations and other electronic applications 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from integrated circuit manufacturers who pay license fees and royalties to us to use our intellectual property components in the products they manufacture 
these integrated circuit manufacturing customers work with integrated circuit designers who incorporate our intellectual property components in their designs 
our customers include the following foundries  which are independent manufacturing facilities  integrated circuit companies that design and manufacture their own integrated circuit products  system manufacturers which are integrated circuit companies that design and manufacture integrated circuits for use in their electronic products  integrated circuit companies that manufacture products for their customers  and fabless integrated circuit companies  which do not have their own manufacturing facilities  but use our intellectual property components in their integrated circuit designs 
integrated circuit designers use our intellectual property components to help ensure that integrated circuits will work to specification before they are manufactured 
these integrated circuit designers are customers of our integrated circuit manufacturing customers 
we serve as an interface layer between integrated circuit designers and manufacturers 
this manufacturing process interface layer is important since every integrated circuit design must be mapped into a given manufacturing process to achieve specified performance and desired yield 
the use of our intellectual property components by integrated circuit designers encourages integrated circuit manufacturers to license our intellectual property components 
we believe that integrated circuit designers view intellectual property components as an important link between the design of an integrated circuit and the manufacturing process 
we have licensed our intellectual property components to over a thousand companies involved in integrated circuit design 
we make the core set of our products available to licensed integrated circuit designers at no 
table of contents charge 
we also provide customized intellectual property components and services to our licensed customers on a separate fee basis 
we license our intellectual property components on a nonexclusive  worldwide basis to major integrated circuit manufacturers and generally grant these manufacturers the right to distribute our intellectual property components to their internal design teams and their integrated circuit customers 
we charge manufacturers a license fee that gives them the right to manufacture integrated circuits containing intellectual property components we have developed for their manufacturing process 
with limited exceptions  manufacturers also agree to pay us royalties based on the selling prices of integrated circuits or wafers that contain our intellectual property components 
generally  we credit a portion of the royalty payments to the manufacturer s account to be applied against license fees for future orders placed with us  if any  payable by the manufacturer 
the portion of the royalty payment that is credited to a manufacturer s account to be applied against future license fees  if any  is based on negotiations at the time the license arrangement is signed 
sources of revenue the license of our intellectual property components to an integrated circuit manufacturer typically involves a sales cycle of three to nine months and often coincides with an integrated circuit manufacturing customer s migration to a new manufacturing process 
our contracts with integrated circuit manufacturers generally require them to pay a license fee for each product delivered under a contract 
generally  our license contracts involve multiple products 
throughout the production cycle  integrated circuit manufacturers often request additional products or modifications to existing products that result in additional license revenue 
our contracts generally require payment of a portion of the license fees upon signing of the contract with the final payment due within to days after delivery  which generally takes three to nine months from the contract signing date 
we have been dependent on a relatively small number of integrated circuit manufacturing customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  although the integrated circuit manufacturers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  ibm accounted for of total revenue  tsmc accounted for of total revenue and chartered accounted for of total revenue 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenue 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenue and synopsys accounted for of total revenue 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period depending on the customer s contributing to the addition of new contracts  the timing of work performed by us and the number of designs utilizing our products 
the license of our intellectual property components typically involves a significant commitment of capital by the integrated circuit manufacturer and a purchase from us will often be timed to coincide with a manufacturer s migration to a new manufacturing process geometry 
manufacturers migrating to a new process geometry often view our intellectual property components as a means of attracting integrated circuit designers that use our components 
within a given process geometry  manufacturers may also choose to license additional intellectual property components from us in response to their customer s requirements 
once an order is received  we must commit significant time and resources to the customization of products for such manufacturer 
because we often recognize revenue from such orders on a percentage of completion basis  the customers representing a significant portion of our revenue in a given quarter will depend upon the timing of our receipt of new orders and our progress on the customization of projects actually performed by us during such quarter 
we derive a substantial majority of our total revenue from fees associated with the sale of licenses  including maintenance and support fees 
of these components  maintenance and support fees have historically represented less than of license revenue 
together  these license  maintenance and support fees accounted for of total revenue in fiscal year  of total revenue in fiscal and of total revenue in fiscal we expect that license revenue will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents we calculate royalty revenue based on the selling price of integrated circuits or wafers containing our intellectual property components 
license arrangements call for royalty reporting by each integrated circuit manufacturing customer on either a per integrated circuit or per wafer basis 
given that we provide our intellectual property components early in the customer s integrated circuit design process  there is a delay of approximately one to four years between the time we deliver an intellectual property component and the time we receive royalty revenue  if at all  when the integrated circuits incorporating our intellectual property components are manufactured and sold 
in recent periods  we have established uniform royalty rates  calculated on the basis of the wafer selling prices  applicable to all new licensees 
prior to that  royalty rates varied among integrated circuit manufacturers 
in addition  our agreements with tsmc provide that royalty and credit rates decrease in accordance with a fixed schedule over the life of a given process geometry 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to generate royalty revenue from a large number of designs and on many of these designs achieving substantial manufacturing volumes 
to date  a substantial portion of our net royalty revenue has been derived from one integrated circuit manufacturer  tsmc 
tsmc accounted for of our net royalty revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal net royalty revenue as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal  in and in fiscal historically  a large portion of our total revenue has been generated from outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
as all of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our intellectual property components less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  accounting for investments  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairments  contingencies  restructuring costs and other special charges and taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue that is not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
some of our most critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs revenue recognition we follow specific and detailed guidelines in recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position and statement of position  as well as accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts  and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
however  our judgments may affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue in any given period is difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 

table of contents we recognize and report revenue in two separate categories license revenue and net royalty revenue 
license revenue is comprised of license  maintenance and support fees 
license fees are derived from the purchase of a license for our products 
maintenance fees are derived from maintenance contracts with our integrated circuit manufacturing customers  which are generally purchased at the same time as a license for the product 
support fees are derived from arrangements with integrated circuit designers to support the use of our intellectual property components in their designs 
royalty revenue is derived from fees based on the selling prices of integrated circuits or wafers containing our intellectual property components 
license revenue 
for all licenses  we use both a binding purchase order and a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we assess cash collectibility based on a number of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
in cases where we believe a customer s credit worthiness is uncertain  we require prepayment or a letter of credit as assurance of payment 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes probable 
for licensed products which do not require significant customization of intellectual property components  we generally recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
for licensed products requiring significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service agreements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  these losses have not been significant 
costs incurred in advance of billings are recorded as costs in excess of related billings on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amounts billed to customers  the excess amount is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
for arrangements with multiple elements  such as product licenses and maintenance services  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those licensed products and services when sold separately and for maintenance is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in license arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed or fair value can objectively be determined 
when the fair value of a license element has not been established  we use the residual method to record license revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
we derive maintenance fees from maintenance contracts  which are generally purchased by integrated circuit manufacturers at the same time as a license for our intellectual property components 
maintenance includes telephone and email support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance may generally be renewed on an annual basis 
we recognize revenue for maintenance  based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
we generally determine vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance based on the stated fees for maintenance renewal set forth in the original license and first maintenance agreement 

table of contents we derive support fees from arrangements with integrated circuit designers to support the use of our intellectual property components in their designs 
support includes telephone and email support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
we recognize support fees ratably over the support period 
support arrangements generally have a term of months and may be renewed for additional month periods 
royalty revenue 
we recognize royalty revenue based on royalty reports received from integrated circuit manufacturers  generally on a one quarter lag basis 
in accordance with contract terms  we generally credit a portion of each royalty payment back to the integrated circuit manufacturer s account to be applied against future license fees  if any  payable by the manufacturer 
we report the remaining portion of the royalty as net royalty revenue 
the amount of credits that can be earned by an integrated circuit manufacturer is generally limited to the cumulative amount of orders placed by that integrated circuit manufacturer for a given process technology 
an integrated circuit manufacturer has a limited time to use the credits before they expire  generally twelve to eighteen months from the time credits are earned 
as a result  we defer revenue associated with our credit program until the integrated circuit manufacturer licenses additional products or the credit expires  whichever is earlier 
if the integrated circuit manufacturer does not use the credits within the stated period  we record the amount of the expired credits as net royalty revenue as we no longer have an obligation to provide any future products for the expired credits 
historically  integrated circuit manufacturing customers have utilized substantially all credits to purchase additional licensed products prior to expiration of the credits 
when the integrated circuit manufacturing customers use credits  we recognize the credits as license revenue when our revenue recognition criteria have been met 
accounting for investments we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
to date  all marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
marketable securities are presented as current or long term assets based on their scheduled maturities 
realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific identification method 
we review our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  we write down the investment to fair market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable and our historical experience 
if a major customer s creditworthiness were to deteriorate  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period 
the impact of any change in the allowance for doubtful accounts may be affected by our reliance on a relatively small number of integrated circuit manufacturers for a large portion of our total revenue 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of 
table of contents long lived  goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate an impairment has occurred 
we adopted sfas during the first quarter of fiscal our acquired workforce does not qualify as a separately identifiable intangible asset and on adoption of sfas was reclassified as goodwill 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  other than the cessation of amortization of goodwill 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
accounting for income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical taxable income  expectations and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as of september   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
acquisitions in february  we acquired nurlogic design  inc nurlogic for consideration consisting of approximately million in cash   shares of common stock valued at approximately million  and assumed options to acquire  shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price per share of and a fair value of approximately million 
we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
nurlogic s technology adds complementary analog  mixed signal and communication components to our product portfolio 
our acquisition of nurlogic has resulted in a significant increase in our costs and expenses relating primarily to the increased headcount and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
this increase in our costs and expenses has affected and will continue to affect the comparability of our financial statements in future periods 
in january  we acquired certain assets of the physical library business of synopsys for approximately million 
we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
upon consummation of our acquisition of certain assets of the synopsys physical library business  we immediately charged to expense million representing acquired in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in fiscal  our acquisition of such assets from synopsys resulted in a significant increase in our costs and expenses relating primarily to the increased headcount and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition 
in accordance with sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal

cost of revenue fiscal percent inc dec fiscal percent inc dec fiscal in thousands engineering costs are allocated between cost of revenue and product development 
we track specific customer projects and product development efforts based on unique project codes that are assigned at the inception of each project 
individual engineers devoted to these projects record time to these project codes as actual hours are incurred 
engineering efforts devoted to specific customer projects are recognized as cost of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
engineering efforts devoted to the general development of our technology are charged to product development 
engineering costs related to product development are expensed as incurred

in process research and development expense of million in fiscal year was related to our acquisition of certain assets of synopsys physical library business in january and was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the 
table of contents fair value of the existing purchased technology and patents  as well as the technology under development  was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate used in the present value calculations was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the particular technologies and the development life cycle

we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities and our international operations  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the costs and timing of future acquisitions  if any  competing technological and market developments  the costs involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the level and timing of license and royalty revenue  available borrowings under line of credit arrangements  if any  and other factors 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional debt or equity financing arrangements may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants

sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas sfas provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
these disclosures are now required for interim periods in addition to annual disclosure 
we adopted the additional disclosure provisions of sfas the transition provisions of sfas are currently not applicable to us as we continue to account for options under apb in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity vie is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other 
table of contents legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin are effective immediately for vie s created after january  the consolidation requirements for older vie s are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements are effective for all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was established 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and further requires that an issuer classify as a liability or an asset in some circumstances financial instruments that fall within its scope because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of such instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
sfas is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors affecting future operating results the following lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
if any of the material risks or uncertainties we face were to occur  the trading price of our securities could decline 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate in the future  as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in the demand for integrated circuits and end user products that incorporate integrated circuits  our ability to develop  introduce and market new intellectual property components before our competitors  the relatively large size and small number of orders we receive during a given period  the timing of orders  reflecting in part the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our customers  the length of our sales cycle  the gain or loss by us of a large integrated circuit manufacturing customer or the gain or loss by our customer of a major order of integrated circuits containing our intellectual property components  the size and timing of the manufacture and sale by our integrated circuit manufacturing customers of integrated circuits containing our intellectual property components  the timing and results of our audit of royalty reports submitted to us by our customers  the accuracy of our estimates for project completion costs  which require significant management judgment and discretion  
table of contents our progress on contracts that are recognized as revenue on a percentage of completion basis  which represent a substantial majority of our contracts and generally have completion periods of six to nine months  and the timing and magnitude of costs incurred by us in developing and marketing new intellectual property components and market acceptance of such components 
our future revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and on an annual basis as a result of these and other factors 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue 
if revenue is below our expectations in any quarter and we are not able to adjust spending in a timely manner  the negative effect of such shortfall may increase 
we intend to continue our investment in product development as well as in product promotion  licensing and support programs in an effort to maximize the growth of future revenue and net income 
accordingly  it is likely that in some future quarters our expenses will represent a greater than expected percentage of our revenue  causing our operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which could cause our stock price to decline  perhaps substantially 
our sales cycle is unpredictable and may be more than months  so we may fail to adjust our resources and expenses adequately to meet anticipated or actual demand 
the license of our intellectual property components typically involves a significant commitment of capital by the integrated circuit manufacturer and a purchase will often be timed to coincide with an integrated circuit manufacturer s migration to a new manufacturing process or process variation 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available intellectual property components and require that we expend substantial time  effort and resources to educate them about the value of our intellectual property components 
despite these efforts  potential customers may select an alternate product or delay or forego a license of our intellectual property components 
as a result  the sales cycle for our intellectual property components is long  typically ranging from three to nine months  and may in some cases be more than months 
our ability to forecast the timing and scope of specific sales is limited 
if we were to experience a delay in our orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts or investors expectations for a given quarter and ultimately result in a decrease in our stock price 
once we receive and accept an order for a customized product from an integrated circuit manufacturer  we must commit significant resources to customizing our products for the integrated circuit manufacturer s manufacturing process 
we generate a substantial majority of our license revenue from customized products 
this customization is complex and time consuming and is subject to a number of risks over which we have little or no control 
these risks include the integrated circuit manufacturer s alterations of its manufacturing process and the timing of its migration to a new process 
typically  this customization  once started  takes from six to nine months to complete and any delays may cause us to defer revenue recognition or potentially lose orders 
if we fail to adequately adjust our resources and expenses to meet actual demand and actual revenue  our business may suffer 
if anticipated orders fail to materialize  we may be unable to reduce our resources and expenses in time and our operating results could suffer 
in addition  where integrated circuit manufacturer orders exceed our anticipated demand  we may be unable to deliver customized products in time to meet the integrated circuit manufacturer s requirements 
any delays in product customization and delivery give rise to the risk of alteration or potential cancellation of orders or may harm our relationships with our customers 
because we rely on a relatively small number of integrated circuit manufacturers for a large portion of our revenue  our revenue could decline if our integrated circuit manufacturing customers do not continue to purchase and use our intellectual property components 
we have been dependent on a relatively small number of integrated circuit manufacturing customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  although the integrated circuit manufacturers comprising this group have changed from time to time 
in fiscal  ibm accounted for of total revenues  tsmc accounted for 
table of contents of total revenues and chartered accounted for 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues 
in fiscal  tsmc accounted for of total revenues and synopsys accounted for of total revenues 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period depending on the addition of new contracts  the timing of work performed by us and the number of designs utilizing our products 
our business is subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success of these and other customers  including competition faced by these manufacturers  market acceptance of their products  and the engineering  sales and marketing capabilities of such customers 
in addition  we believe that the licensing of our intellectual property components by integrated circuit manufacturers is driven in part by a desire on the part of such manufacturers to attract integrated circuit designers to their foundries 
in the event that such manufacturers begin to operate at or near their manufacturing capacities  they may elect to reduce their marketing activities  including their purchase of our products for use by integrated circuit design teams 
we have incurred operating losses in recent periods and may be unable to maintain profitability 
although we were profitable in fiscal and fiscal  we incurred net operating losses in the first six months of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal if our revenue in future periods increases more slowly than we expect  or not at all  we may not maintain profitability 
in addition  most of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term  so any shortfall in anticipated revenue in a given period could significantly reduce our operating results below expectations 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with product development  operational and administrative activities and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we will need to increase revenue relative to increases in costs to maintain profitability 
we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if we fail to maintain profitability  our business and financial condition would suffer  we could lose the benefit of tax credits and deferred tax assets and our stock price could decline 
tsmc  one of our largest customers  develops and distributes products that compete with ours 
tsmc  one of our largest integrated circuit manufacturing customers  has historically produced intellectual property components for use by third parties in designs to be manufactured at tsmc s foundry 
these components are designed to serve the same purpose as components produced by us 
the intellectual property components developed by tsmc have competed and are expected to continue to compete with our products 
we believe that tsmc is more aggressively developing and distributing these products to encourage its customers to use tsmc to manufacture their current and future designs 
tsmc has substantially greater financial  manufacturing and other resources  name recognition and market presence than we do and the internal design group at tsmc has greater access to technical information about tsmc s manufacturing processes 
distribution partners selected by tsmc include cadence  magma and virage logic 
some of tsmc s distribution partners  such as cadence  may have greater resources  name recognition and distribution networks than we do 
if tsmc is successful in supplying its own intellectual property components to third parties either directly or through distribution arrangements with other companies  our revenue from tsmc  our revenue from other customers and our operating results could be negatively affected 
our customers are not obligated to purchase additional products from us or manufacture integrated circuits with our products  which may cause our operating results to suffer 
none of our customers has a written agreement with us that obligates them to license future generations of intellectual property components or additional intellectual property components from us  and we cannot be certain that any customer will license intellectual property components from us in the future 
our revenue from these customers may be comprised of license fees and royalties 
in addition  we cannot be certain that any of the integrated circuit manufacturers will produce products incorporating our intellectual property components or that  
table of contents if production occurs  they will generate significant royalty revenue for us 
if one or more of our major integrated circuit manufacturing customers stops licensing our intellectual property components  reduces its orders  fails to pay license or royalty fees due or does not produce products containing our intellectual property components  our operating results could be materially and negatively affected 
we have relied and expect to continue to rely on royalties as a key component of our business model and if we fail to realize expected royalties our business will suffer 
royalties are calculated based on the selling prices of integrated circuits or wafers containing our intellectual property components 
we believe that our long term success is substantially dependent on future royalties 
we face risks inherent in a royalty based business model  such as the rate of incorporation of our intellectual property components into integrated circuit designs  the rate of adoption of our intellectual property components by integrated circuit manufacturers and the demand for products incorporating these integrated circuits 
our royalty revenue is highly dependent upon the level of integrated circuit production and sales by our integrated circuit manufacturing customers 
fluctuations in orders placed with our integrated circuit manufacturing customers from their customers could significantly affect our royalty revenue and operating results 
additionally  our ability to forecast and realize royalty revenue is limited by factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the timing of the manufacture of royalty bearing integrated circuits or wafers  the price charged by integrated circuit manufacturers to their customers for royalty bearing integrated circuits or wafers  and the quantity of royalty bearing integrated circuits or wafers ordered and actually manufactured 
we believe that a significant portion of our royalty revenue in fiscal was derived from the manufacture and sale of integrated circuits for graphics applications 
if the market for integrated circuits in graphics applications declines  our royalty revenue may be adversely affected 
on a period to period basis  net royalty revenue may vary significantly 
net royalty revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in the third quarter  in the second quarter and in the first quarter 
there is significant delay and uncertainty between the delivery of our intellectual property components and the generation of royalty revenue 
in addition to the factors described above  this delay and uncertainty is due to the delivery and application of our intellectual property components early in the integrated circuit design process and delays in the reporting of the production and sale of royalty bearing integrated circuits or wafers 
the time between the delivery of our intellectual property components to a customer and the manufacture in volume of integrated circuits containing our intellectual property components may be three years or longer 
thus  we cannot anticipate the impact of royalty payments on our financial results when we negotiate royalty agreements 
we recognize royalty revenue in the quarter in which we receive a royalty report from an integrated circuit manufacturer  provided that other conditions to revenue recognition have been satisfied 
as a result  our recognition of royalty revenue typically lags behind the quarter in which the related integrated circuit is manufactured or sold by the integrated circuit manufacturing customer by at least one quarter 
we cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful in expanding the number of contracts with integrated circuit manufacturers  nor can we be certain that we will receive significant royalty revenue in the future 
tsmc accounted for of our net royalty revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our agreements with tsmc provide that royalty rates decrease in accordance with a fixed schedule over the life of a given process 
as a result  our net royalty revenue may decline if royalties from tsmc continue to represent a substantial portion of our net royalty revenue 
we also face risks relating to the accuracy and completeness of the royalty collection process 
our ability to generate royalty revenue depends  in part  on our ability to negotiate  structure  monitor and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties 
we have only limited experience and systems in place to conduct reviews of the accuracy of the royalty reports we receive from our licensees 
we have the right to audit the records of integrated circuit manufacturers who license our intellectual property components to help ensure the integrity of their royalty reporting systems  however  these audits may only be conducted periodically and may be at our expense 
we cannot be certain that the costs incurred by us in conducting these audits will not exceed 
table of contents the royalties that result from these efforts 
furthermore  the timing and findings of such royalty audits have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in significant fluctuations in the level and timing of our royalty revenue 
we continue to experience intense competition from other intellectual property component providers  integrated circuit manufacturers and electronic design automation companies  and this competition could negatively affect our business and our revenue 
our strategy of targeting integrated circuit manufacturers and integrated circuit designers that participate in  or may enter  the system on a chip market requires us to compete in intensely competitive markets 
we face significant competition from third party intellectual property component providers  such as barcelona design  dolphin  faraday technology  monolithic system technology  neolinear  rambus  tricn  verisilicon  virage logic and virtual silicon and from the internal design groups of integrated circuit manufacturers such as tsmc and ibm 
in addition  we face competition from small consulting firms and design companies that operate in the intellectual property component segment of the market and offer a limited selection of specialized intellectual property components 
we face significant competition from the internal design groups of integrated circuit manufacturers that have expanded their manufacturing capabilities and portfolio of intellectual property components to participate in the system on a chip market 
integrated circuit manufacturers that license our intellectual property components have historically had their own internal intellectual property component design groups 
these design groups continue to compete with us for access to the integrated circuit manufacturer s intellectual property component requisitions and  in some cases  compete with us to supply intellectual property components to third parties 
intellectual property components developed by internal design groups are designed to utilize the qualities of their own manufacturing process  and may therefore benefit from capacity  informational  cost and technical advantages 
if internal design groups expand their intellectual property component offerings to compete directly with our intellectual property components or actively seek to participate as vendors in the intellectual property component market  our revenue and operating results could be negatively affected 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from new market entrants with intellectual property components that may be less expensive than ours or that may provide better performance or additional features not currently provided by our intellectual property components 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater name recognition and market presence  longer operating histories  lower cost structures and larger customer bases than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
in addition  some of our principal competitors maintain their own electronic design automation tools and intellectual property component libraries which allow them to offer a single vendor solution 
our ability to compete successfully in the market for intellectual property components will depend upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control including  but not limited to continued market acceptance of products using integrated circuits and industry and general economic conditions  access to adequate electronic design automation tools  many of which are licensed from our current or potential competitors  access to adequate technical information from integrated circuit manufacturers  many of which are actual or potential competitors  our ability to implement new designs at smaller process geometries  our ability to expand and protect our intellectual property  our ability to manage our staffing levels to respond to increases in customer demand for specific products or services that may occur from time to time  
table of contents the price  quality and timing of our new intellectual property components and those of our competitors  the emergence of new intellectual property component interchangeability standards  the widespread licensing of intellectual property components by integrated circuit manufacturers or their design groups to third party manufacturers  market acceptance of our intellectual property components  and success of competitive intellectual property components 
if we fail to enhance our intellectual property components and develop and introduce new intellectual property components on a timely basis  we may not be able to address the needs of our customers  our technology may become obsolete and our results of operations may be harmed 
our customers compete in the integrated circuit industry  which is subject to rapid technological change  frequent introductions of new products  short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and requirements and evolving industry standards 
the development of new manufacturing processes  the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
accordingly  our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance our existing intellectual property components and to develop and introduce new intellectual property components that satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and that keep pace with new product introductions  emerging manufacturing process technologies and other technological developments in the integrated circuit industry 
we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
this investment of funds  time and other resources involves numerous risks  including risks of development obstacles and delays and risks of poor market reaction to such new products  which could cause our expenses to represent a greater than expected percentage of our revenue in any given quarter 
if we fail to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in manufacturing processes or customer requirements  or if we experience significant delays in intellectual property component development  our business and operating results may be negatively affected 
we cannot be certain that we will avoid difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful introduction  development and sale of new or enhanced intellectual property components or that the new or enhanced intellectual property components will achieve market acceptance 
if we do not satisfy our delivery commitments  then we could also be exposed to litigation or claims from our customers 
any claim could have a material negative effect on our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in the progress of customization of new intellectual property components for a given customer  and we may continue to experience delays in the future 
any delay or failure to meet customers expectations could result in damage to customer relationships and our reputation  underutilization of engineering resources  delay in the market acceptance of our intellectual property components or a decline in revenue  any of which could negatively affect our business 
we face risks from sales to foreign customers and foreign operations  which could reduce our operating results and harm our financial condition 
historically  a large portion of our total revenue has been derived from integrated circuit manufacturers located outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal revenue derived from customers in taiwan as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of our total revenue in the future 
to date  all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
if our competitors denominate their sales in a currency that becomes relatively inexpensive in comparison to the us dollar  then we may experience fewer orders from international customers whose business is based primarily on the less expensive currency 
in addition  future dislocations in international financial markets may materially affect our business 

table of contents we intend to expand our sales  marketing and design activities in asia and europe 
we have established an engineering services and support facility in bangalore  india and intend to increase our presence in china and taiwan 
international expansion will result in increased costs and may not be successful  which could harm our business 
our expansion of international activity and dependence on customers outside the united states involves a number of risks including the impact of possible recessions in economies outside the united states  which  given our reliance on foreign customers for a substantial portion of our revenue  could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations  political and economic instability  including instability relating to north korea and tensions between taiwan and china and india and pakistan  which could have a significant impact on us due to the concentration of our manufacturing and design customers in taiwan and our design center in india  the impact of a possible recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in china  taiwan and other countries in which we do a significant amount of business  exchange rate fluctuations which  due to the denomination of our foreign sales in us dollars  could significantly increase the cost of our products to our foreign customers  the impact of export license requirements  such as those that may apply to our high speed specialty input output circuits  could necessitate changes to our existing open access web based distribution platform and delay or prevent sales to customers in restricted countries  difficulties in enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights  which difficulties could have a significant adverse effect on our business given our open access distribution model  and our reliance on contractual and intellectual property rights to limit the use of our products and generate royalties  and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  which  given our lack of experience with remote operations and our expansion into india  could have a significant negative impact on our business 
if we are unable to sustain or increase revenue derived from international customers or minimize the foregoing risks  our business may be materially and adversely affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
increased international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  enhanced national security measures  continuing military action in afghanistan and iraq  strained international relations with north korea  tensions between taiwan and china  tensions between india and pakistan and other conflicts in the middle east and asia  may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs and may adversely affect our stock price 
this increased instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively affect the desire of our employees and customers to travel  lead to stricter export controls  adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates or require us to take extra security precautions for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  this international political instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  our ability to manage our business and continue our growth would be negatively impacted 
our success depends in large part on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
none of our senior 
table of contents management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key man life insurance covering our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
if we are unable to effectively integrate and utilize newly hired engineering  management or sales personnel  the execution of our business strategy and our ability to react to changing market conditions may be impeded and our business could suffer 
competition for personnel is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or experience delays in the integration of new personnel in the united states and abroad  our business and operations may suffer 
our historical growth and acquisitions have placed and future acquisitions may place a significant strain on our management systems and resources and we may be unable to effectively control our costs and implement our business strategies as a result 
our ability to license our intellectual property components and manage our business successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
our historical growth  international expansion  acquisitions  including our acquisition of nurlogic in february  have placed  and are expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we have established an engineering service and support facility in bangalore  india and plan to increase our presence in china and taiwan 
the number of our employees or their full time equivalents has increased to on september  from on september  our international expansion has resulted and is expected to continue to result in increased costs 
our customers rely heavily on our technological expertise in designing  testing and manufacturing products incorporating our intellectual property components 
relationships with new integrated circuit manufacturers generally require significant engineering support that may increase the strain on our personnel  particularly our engineers 
we cannot be certain that our systems and resources will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to implement our business plan 
if we are not able to effectively integrate and develop the operations of nurlogic  our business may suffer 
we acquired nurlogic in february we have integrated the workforce and operations of nurlogic into our organizational structure and we are working towards the effective utilization of the additional workforce 
we face various integration and operational risks as a result of this acquisition including  but not limited to our ability to retain and motivate nurlogic s employees  our ability to retain and develop nurlogic s customers  our ability to use our traditional business model to market and sell nurlogic s analog and mixed signal products and services to semiconductor manufacturers in exchange for license fees and royalties  the failure or a delay in integrating the technology  operations and workforce of nurlogic with our company  the failure to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisition  the incurrence of substantial unanticipated integration costs  the diversion of significant management attention and financial resources in assimilating nurlogic s business  and the disruption of our ongoing business 

table of contents we license our products on a nonexclusive  worldwide basis to major semiconductor manufacturers and grant these manufacturers the right to distribute our products to their internal design teams and to their application specific integrated circuit and fabless semiconductor customers 
the basic elements of our product libraries are distributed to integrated circuit design companies or end users at no charge to them 
historically  nurlogic has licensed its products directly to end users who have agreed to pay license fees directly to nurlogic 
we cannot be sure that semiconductor manufacturers will be willing to license and pay for analog and mixed signal intellectual property components for the benefit of end users in the same way as such manufactures have historically licensed digital intellectual property components from us 
such analog and mixed signal intellectual property components tend to require a greater degree of customization for a particular use than do many of our other products 
to date  we have had only limited success in expanding the customer base for these products beyond nurlogic s historical customer base  and if we are unable to expand the existing customer base for these products  our revenues from such products may not grow 
if we are not able to successfully integrate and develop nurlogic s business  our business may be negatively affected in future periods  which may cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if the value of intangible assets acquired becomes impaired  we will be required to write down the value of the assets  which would negatively affect our financial results 
we may incur liabilities from nurlogic including liabilities for intellectual property infringement or indemnification of nurlogic s customers for similar claims  that could materially and adversely affect our business 
if our efforts to integrate nurlogic s business with our existing business are unsuccessful  our future revenue and operating results could be negatively affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our acquisition of nurlogic will make planning and predicting our future growth rates and operating results more difficult 
our acquisition of nurlogic may reduce our revenue growth rate and make prediction of our future revenue  costs and expenses and operating results more difficult 
we have begun to offer nurlogic s analog  mixed signal and communications components to our existing customer base 
however  we cannot predict the level of demand for nurlogic s products from these customers 
to date  we have had limited success in expanding the existing customer base for these products beyond nurlogic s historical customer base  and if we are unable to expand the existing customer base for these products  revenues from these products may not grow 
we may also incur additional costs in order to customize the existing nurlogic products to meet our customer requirements 
we expect our results of operations in future periods will reflect an expanded workforce and product development effort and changed customer base 
due to the acquisition  we may not be able to accurately predict how the combined business will evolve  the possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of the combined businesses  or the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition 
in addition  we have limited experience integrating remote operations into our organization structure 
if we are unable to efficiently manage this integration  we may incur additional expenses and experience delays in our engineering and marketing efforts 
we may make future acquisitions that could cause our business to suffer 
we may continue to make investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
if we buy a company or a division of a company  we may experience difficulty integrating that company or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  cash management and financial reporting  
table of contents our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated  and our increasing international presence resulting from acquisitions may increase our exposure to foreign political  currency  and tax risks 
in connection with future acquisitions  we may be required to assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire 
by assuming the liabilities  we may incur liabilities  including those related to intellectual property infringement or indemnification of customers of acquired businesses for similar claims that could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which would involve restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we are in the process of establishing our first remote engineering sites which  if not structured and managed effectively  could cause our business to suffer 
we are establishing an engineering service and support facility in bangalore  india 
in addition  due to our acquisition of nurlogic  we perform engineering services in san diego  california 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering centers outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our expansion of engineering operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of risks including increased difficulty in coordinating our engineering efforts  obtaining required equipment and tools and training new personnel  increased communications and travel costs and potential delays in our engineering efforts 
our future capital needs may require that we seek debt financing or additional equity funding which  if not available  could cause our business to suffer 
we intend to continue to invest heavily in the development of new intellectual property components and enhancements to our existing intellectual property components 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the costs and timing of expansion of our international operations  the extent to which our existing and new intellectual property components gain market acceptance  the cost and timing of future acquisitions  if any  competing technological and market developments  the cost involved in maintaining and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights and defending against any future claims of intellectual property infringement  the cost of any stock repurchases pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program  and the level and timing of license and royalty revenue 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot be certain that the funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if we fail to raise capital when needed  our business will be negatively affected  which could cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents risks related to our market our business depends on continued demand for integrated circuits and the electronic equipment that incorporate them 
our business is substantially dependent on the adoption of our technology by integrated circuit manufacturers and on an increasing demand for products requiring integrated circuits  such as portable computing devices  cellular phones  consumer multimedia products  automotive electronics  personal computers and workstations 
our business is subject to many risks beyond our control that influence the success of our customers including  among others  competition faced by each customer in its particular industry  market acceptance of the customer s products that incorporate our technology  the engineering  sales and marketing capabilities of the customer and the financial and other resources of the customer 
demand for our intellectual property components may also be affected by consolidation in the integrated circuit and related industries  which may reduce the aggregate level of purchases of our intellectual property components and services by the combined companies 
the revenue we generate from licensing activities depends in large part on the rate at which integrated circuit manufacturers adopt new product generations  which  in turn  is affected by the level of demand for integrated circuits 
with increasing complexity in each successive generation of integrated circuit products  we face the risk that the rate of adoption of smaller process geometries for integrated circuit manufacturing may slow 
we also face the risk that our licensing revenue may suffer if our customers collaborate with each other regarding design standards for particular generations of integrated circuit products 
revenue generated from royalties depends on production and sale of integrated circuits or wafers that incorporate our technology 
if the integrated circuit and electronics products industries experience a further downturn  our business could suffer 
the integrated circuit industry is cyclical in nature and a continued downturn may negatively affect the growth of our revenue 
the markets for integrated circuit products are cyclical 
the integrated circuit industry suffered a sharp decline in orders and revenue in and and this weakness has continued in many integrated circuit manufacturers and vendors of products incorporating integrated circuits have announced earnings shortfalls and employee layoffs 
we believe these conditions may negatively affect our business in the future if they persist 
the outlook for the electronics industry is uncertain and it is very difficult to predict future economic events 
the primary customers for our intellectual property components are integrated circuit design and manufacturing companies 
any significant downturn in our customers markets  or domestic and global conditions is likely to adversely affect our royalty revenue 
such a downturn may also result in a decline in demand for our intellectual property components and services and could harm our business 
continued weakness in the integrated circuit and related industries  a reduced number of design starts  shifts in the types of integrated circuits manufactured  such as a shift to field programmable gate arrays  tightening of customers operating budgets or consolidation among our customers could cause our business to suffer 
if the market for third party intellectual property components does not expand  our business may suffer 
our ability to achieve sustained revenue growth and profitability in the future will depend on the continued development of the market for third party intellectual property components and  to a large extent  on the demand for system on a chip integrated circuits 
system on a chip integrated circuits are characterized by rapid technological change and competition from an increasing number of alternate design strategies such as combining multiple integrated circuits to create a system on a package and shifts to the use of field programmable gate arrays or fpgas 
we cannot be certain that the market for third party intellectual property components and system on a chip integrated circuits will continue to develop or grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 
if either of these markets fails to grow or develops slower than expected  our business may suffer 
a significant number of our existing and potential customers currently rely on components developed internally and or by other vendors 
our future growth  if any  is dependent on the adoption of  and increased reliance on  third party intellectual property components by both existing and potential customers 

table of contents integrated circuit manufacturing facilities are subject to risk of natural disasters  which  if they were to occur  could harm our revenue and profitability 
integrated circuit manufacturing facilities have in the past experienced major reductions in foundry capacity due to earthquakes in taiwan  japan and california 
for example  taiwan  where several of our largest customers are located  experienced several earthquakes in that impacted foundries through power outages  physical damage and employee dislocation 
the license component of our revenue depends on manufacturers transitioning to new process geometries 
the royalty component of our revenue is directly related to the manufacture and sale of integrated circuits containing our intellectual property components 
as a result  our business could suffer if a major integrated circuit manufacturer s transition to a new process geometry or manufacturing capacity was adversely affected by a natural disaster such as an earthquake  fire  tornado or flood 
risks related to our intellectual property rights if we are not able to preserve and expand the value of the intellectual property included in our intellectual property components  our business will suffer 
we rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to continue to expand our intellectual property and enforce and protect our patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  our business could suffer  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in certain instances  we have elected to rely on trade secret law rather than patent law to protect our proprietary technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees and customers 
we cannot be certain that these contracts have not and will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered and possibly patented by competitors 
effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign jurisdictions  such as china  where we sell our intellectual property components 
as a result  we may experience difficulty protecting our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by others in foreign countries 
the risks associated with protection of our intellectual property rights in foreign countries are likely to increase as we expand our international operations 
an infringement claim or a significant damage award would adversely impact our operating results 
substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in our industry and the integrated circuit industry 
from time to time  third parties  including our competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
we cannot be certain that we would ultimately prevail in any dispute or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms 
any infringement claim brought against us  regardless of the duration  outcome or size of damage award  could result in substantial cost to us  divert our management s attention and resources  be time consuming to defend  result in substantial damage awards  cause product shipment delays  or require us to seek to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements 

table of contents any infringement claim or other litigation against or by us could have a material negative affect on our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
in any potential dispute involving our intellectual property  our customers and strategic partners could also become the target of litigation 
this could trigger our technical support and indemnification obligations in our license agreements  which could result in substantial expense to us 
in addition to the time and expense required for us to supply support or indemnification to our customers and strategic partners  any litigation could severely disrupt or shut down the business of our customers and strategic partners  which in turn would hurt our relations with them and harm our operating results 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims by our customers or customers of the companies we acquire that our intellectual property components or products of acquired companies that have been incorporated into electronic products infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
our future acquisitions  if any  may increase the risk that customers of these companies bring claims of intellectual property infringement or indemnification for intellectual property infringement against us 
we have been notified by one of nurlogic s customers that it is requesting indemnification from nurlogic now one of our wholly owned subsidiaries because of two complaints filed against that customer alleging that some of that customer s products infringed third party patents 
while we believe that the complaints are without merit with respect to technology licensed by nurlogic  there can be no assurance that the courts would not find that the technology licensed by nurlogic does infringe third party patents 
whether or not the customer s or nurlogic s products infringe  the investigation and resolution of these indemnity claims and any related litigation can be expensive and can consume substantial amounts of management time and attention 
defects in our proprietary technologies and intellectual property components could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share 
if the intellectual property components we provide to a customer contain defects that increase our customers cost of goods sold and time to market  the market acceptance of our intellectual property components would be harmed 
any actual or perceived defects in our intellectual property components may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers  leading to a decrease in our revenue 
these defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new proprietary technologies or enhancements to existing proprietary technologies 
our intellectual property components may contain errors or defects not discovered until after volume manufacture of integrated circuits containing our intellectual property components 
if our intellectual property components contain errors or defects  we could be required to expend significant resources to alleviate these problems  which could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts 
the defects or errors could also result in fewer wafers containing our intellectual property components reaching production  which would reduce our royalty revenue 
risks related to our stock our stock is subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  international political instability  including instability associated with military action in afghanistan and iraq  strained relations with north korea and other conflicts  fluctuations in national and international securities markets in response to changing economic or other conditions  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  our failure to achieve the operating results anticipated by analysts or investors  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  releases or reports by or changes in security analysts recommendations  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
for example  from october  to september   the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has ranged from a high of to a low of 
if our revenue and results of operations are below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors  significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has occurred against that company 
the litigation could result in substantial costs and would at a minimum divert management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  which could further reduce our stock price 
any adverse decision in the litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers or prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of the shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
if we issue any of these shares of preferred stock in the future  the rights of holders of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if we issue preferred stock  a change of control of our company could be delayed  deferred or prevented 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder as defined by that statute 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
these provisions include cumulative voting for the election of directors  the elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders  and the establishment of an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals and director nominations to be acted upon at annual meetings of the stockholders 
in december  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under this plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock 
each right initially entitles stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for however  the rights are not immediately exercisable 
if a person or group acquires  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of  a certain percentage of our common stock  unless the rights are redeemed by us for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders  except the acquiring person or group  for shares of our preferred stock or the stock of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the right s then current exercise price 

table of contents these provisions are designed to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and give our board of directors an opportunity to consider various alternatives to increase stockholder value 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy contests 
however  the potential issuance of preferred stock  our charter and bylaw provisions  the restrictions in section of the delaware general corporation law and our stockholder rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
these provisions and plans may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our marketable securities 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers and the us government or its agencies 
our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the table below presents the carrying value and related weighted average interest rates for our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the carrying values approximate fair values at september  and at september   marketable securities consisted of million with a maturity date of less than one year and million with a maturity date of greater than one year 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities carrying value at september  in thousands average rate of return at september  annualized carrying value at september  in thousands average rate of return at september  annualized cash and cash equivalents variable rate money market funds variable rate cash and cash equivalents fixed rate marketable securities fixed rate total currency risk historically  a large portion of our total revenue has been generated from outside of the united states 
international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal we anticipate that international revenue will remain a substantial portion of our total revenue in the future 
as all of our sales are currently denominated in united states dollars  a strengthening of the united states dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we have not historically engaged in any foreign currency hedging transactions
