sales and distribution customers in  the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of its consolidated net sales 
the substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the company can successfully offer its products

the company today sells its products through six principal distribution channels 
the first channel  independent  local office furniture and office products dealers  specialize in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems  mostly to small and medium sized businesses  branch offices of large corporations  and home office owners 
the second distribution channel comprises nationwide chains of office products dealers  or mega dealers  including boise cascade corporation  corporate express inc  a buhrmann company  office depot business services group  and staples commercial advantage 
many of the independent dealers and mega dealer locations assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements  systems layout and product selection  and design and office solution services provided by professional designers 
the third distribution channel  corporate accounts  is where the company has the direct selling relationship with the end user 
installation is normally provided through a dealer 
the fourth distribution channel  wholesalers  serve as distributors of the company s products to independent dealers  mega dealers and superstores 
the company sells to the nation s largest wholesalers  united stationers and sp richards  as well as to regional wholesalers 
wholesalers maintain inventory of standard product lines for resale to the various retailers 
they also special order products from the company in customer selected models and colors 
the company s wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the united states  which enable the company to make its products available for rapid delivery to retailers anywhere in the country 
one customer  united stationers  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated net sales in   and the fifth distribution channel is retail stores  which include office products superstores such as office depot  office max  and staples and warehouse clubs like costco and sam s club

office products dealers  national wholesalers and retailers market their products over the internet and through catalogs published periodically

as of december   the company had an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the first few weeks of the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of december   and million as of december  backlog  in terms of percentage of net sales  was   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the company s products are manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order 
the dollar amount of the company s order backlog is therefore not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the company s expected sales in any particular fiscal period

competition the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors offering similar products 
the company competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products and unsurpassed customer service 
in executing this strategy  the company has two significant classes of competitors 
first  the company competes with numerous small and medium sized office furniture manufacturers that focus on more limited product lines and or end user segments and include global furniture inc a canadian company  kimball office furniture co  chromcraft  paoli  and teknion a canadian company  as well as asian imports 
second  the company competes with the large office furniture manufacturers which control a substantial portion of the market share in the project oriented office furniture market  such as steelcase inc  haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  and knoll  inc 
products and brands offered by these project oriented office furniture market participants have strong acceptance in the market place and have developed  and may continue to develop product designs to compete with the company 
the company also faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in its markets in the future 
hearth products  consisting of prefabricated fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
the company competes primarily against the other large manufacturers which include cfm majestic inc a canadian company and lennox industries inc 
both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of performance  quality  price  complete and on time delivery to the customer  and customer service and support 
the company believes that it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance  superior customer service  and short lead times 
this is made possible  in part  by the company s significant on going investment in product development  highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations  and an extensive distribution network 
the company is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the united states  and believes that it is the largest manufacturer of middle market furniture 
the company is also the largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces in the united states 
for further discussion of the company s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
the company s objective is to offset the effect of inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit 
investments are routinely made in modernizing plants  equipment  support systems  and for rci programs 
these investments collectively focus on business simplification and increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the company s inventories  which ensures the changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions 
environmental the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges of air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the company believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the company will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations 
the company has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental  health  and safety requirements 
the company s environmental professionals work with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility  the company s environmental legal counsel  and consultants on the management of environmental  health and safety issues 
the company s ultimate goal is to reduce and  when practical  eliminate the creation of hazardous waste in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the company to date 
the company does not anticipate that financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal year for environmental control facilities 
it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  the uncertainty of new environmental legislation and technology in this area makes it impossible to know with confidence
