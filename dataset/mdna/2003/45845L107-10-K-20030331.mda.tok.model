general we provide products and services that enable financial institutions and other businesses to implement technology for their operations and to internally manage or outsource essential data and transaction processing activities

in our financial institution services segment  we provide software systems  data processing services and related equipment and services to financial institutions 
our comprehensive suite of products and services allows us to act as a single source provider for the technology and operating needs of financial institutions 
our range of products and services includes core data processing  check processing and imaging  debit card processing  electronic funds transfer eft  data communications management and related products and services 
these products and services work together to help financial institutions manage back office and customer activities  create operating efficiencies and provide better customer service  which enables them to compete more effectively 
most of our customers outsource their processing activities to our data centers located across the united states  while others install 
table of contents our systems in house and perform the processing functions themselves 
our merchant services division  which we refer to as intercept payment solutions  provides credit card transaction processing services  including authorization  transaction capture  and settlement  as well as other payment processing services  to financial institutions and merchants 
merchants who have established their own merchant account can utilize our end to end processing solution  which eliminates the need for the merchant to establish multiple relationships with banks  front end system providers  gateways  and back end processors 
our systems also enable merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for certain financial information about the two segments of our operations 
portions of our business are seasonal  as our revenues and earnings are affected by increased card and check volume during the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter 
most of our products and services require the payment of monthly charges  which allows us to generate recurring revenues 
for the year ended december   recurring revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
intercept is a georgia corporation and our principal offices are located at holcomb bridge road  suite  norcross  georgia as of march   we had  full time employees 
highlights in april  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities of internet billing company  ltd 
and certain of its affiliate entities  or ibill 
ibill provides secure transaction services that enable web merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet 
ibill also manages back office functions including reporting  tracking  customer service and sales transactions 
ibill s service is powered by proprietary technology that integrates online payment processing  fraud control  affiliate management and financial reporting and tracking

epx s system provides straight through processing that eliminates a business s need to use a gateway or invest in front end technology to process transactions  whether the transactions take place online  over the telephone or at the point of sale 
in june  we acquired item and remittance processing and statement rendering assets from affiliated computer services  inc acs 
the assets we acquired include two locations in woodbury and utica  new york 
these facilities currently serve more than customers in the northeastern united states 
in september  we announced the opening of an item and image processing center in los angeles  california 
we believe that this center  combined with our center in seattle  washington  positions us to add new customers and further enhance our presence in the pacific coast region 
in october  we signed a letter of intent to provide sovereign bank with item processing and check imaging services 
sovereign is a billion financial institution headquartered in pennsylvania with approximately community banking offices in new england and the mid atlantic states 
we issued  shares of our common stock to sovereign upon execution of the letter of intent 
subsequently  in january  we executed a definitive agreement with sovereign 
to accommodate the additional business  we plan to open four new item processing centers  expand two existing centers and add approximately new employees 
once we convert all of sovereign s item processing and check imaging operations to our centers  sovereign will be our largest customer

a financial institution can have our core systems installed and operate them in house using their own personnel 
most of our customers  however  utilize one of these systems through a service bureau arrangement 
in this case  we house and maintain the software at one of our data centers  and we process our customers data each business day 
this arrangement allows customers to focus on core competencies by outsourcing their data processing needs  which gives them access to our processing systems without the expense of maintaining in house processing operations 
each of our data processing centers serves as a back up facility if another center experiences a natural disaster  destruction or other similar event that eliminates or diminishes its processing capabilities 
electronic funds transfer we believe that increased use and acceptance of atm and debit cards  coupled with technological advances in electronic transaction processing  have created a need for financial service providers to offer a wide variety of eft solutions to their customers

we recognize software license fees and hardware and installation revenue when we have signed a non cancelable license agreement  installed the product and satisfied all significant obligations to the customer 
we recognize maintenance fees over the term of the maintenance period 
we sell some of our software and hardware products under five year  sales type lease agreements under which customers make annual installment payments 
these annual payments include the initial installation and an ongoing license fee

license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the lease 
we license renaissance imaging check imaging software on an in house basis  and we generate revenues from up front license fees and recurring annual maintenance fees charged for this system 
we recognize revenues primarily from the licensing of renaissance imaging in accordance with statement of position  as discussed above 
we also provide check processing and imaging in a service bureau environment under which we generate recurring revenues 
on a service bureau basis  we generate revenues primarily based on the volume of items processed 
we recognize this revenue as we provide the service 
we derive eft revenues principally from processing atm and debit card transactions 
we receive a base fee for providing our atm processing services and an additional fee for each additional atm serviced 
once the number of transactions by a financial institution exceeds established levels for that customer  we charge additional fees for these transactions 
for debit card transactions  we currently receive a portion of the interchange fees generated by our financial institution customers  and we charge a monthly fee if our customers do not meet a specified minimum dollar amount of transactions for a particular month 
during the second quarter of  we began implementation of a new debit card pricing structure  under which we receive a fee for each transaction processed 
under the new pricing  we do not receive a portion of the interchange fee for processing debit card transactions 
we believe that the change to our pricing structure will not materially affect our revenues from debit card processing and 
table of contents that it will materially reduce our exposure to any changes in interchange fees that may be implemented by visa and mastercard 
most charges under our eft service agreements are due and paid monthly 
we generate our data communications management service revenues principally from network management and from equipment configuration services and installation 
we charge a regular monthly fee on an ongoing basis for providing telecommunications connectivity and network management

we recognize maintenance and technical support service ratably over the period during which the services are performed 
merchant services in this segment of our business  we provide payment processing services and merchant portfolio management services 
revenues from merchant processing services are recognized as services are performed 
our service offerings allow merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet using our merchant account  in which event revenue recognized is equal to service fees that we charge to the merchant 
this fee is generally based on a percentage of the total transaction amount 
merchants can also establish their own merchant account with our acquiring bank partners and utilize our end to end processing solution  which eliminates the need for the merchant to establish multiple relationships with banks  front end system providers  gateways  and back end processors 
we recognize revenues related to this service offering net of certain costs that we do not control primarily interchange and other fees charged by credit card associations 
for merchants using our merchant account  we establish and hold rolling reserves for merchant credit losses that arise as a result of  among other things  disputes between cardholders and merchants 
if disputes are not resolved in the merchant s favor  the transaction is charged back to us and the purchase price is refunded to the merchant s customer 
if we are unable to collect from the merchant  we bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction 
our acquiring bank partners also establish and hold reserves for merchant credit losses for merchants using our solution 
if transactions are charged back to our banks and our banks are unable to collect from the merchants  we bear the credit risk for amounts in excess of reserves held by the banks 
recurring revenues and customer reimbursements for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues were recurring revenues 
recurring revenues result from regular monthly  quarterly or annual payments by our customers for ongoing services they use in connection with their businesses and for transaction processing of debit  atm  credit and ach transactions that occur under long term agreements 
these revenues do not include conversion or de conversion fees  initial software license fees  installation fees  hardware sales or similar activities 
customer reimbursements reflect pass through items  primarily postage  that we bill to our customers 
netzee  inc until december   we offered internet banking and voice response products through netzee  inc  and we owned approximately of netzee s outstanding common stock 
we accounted for our investment in netzee under the equity method  which required us to record netzee s results of operations in a single line item in our statement of operations titled equity in loss of affiliate 

table of contents on december   certegy  inc acquired substantially all of the assets of netzee for approximately million 
in january we received approximately million in payment on the line of credit that we jointly provided with john h 
harland company to netzee and  for the purchase of the common stock of netzee that we owned 
as of december  we recorded a one time charge of million related to the sale of netzee 
public offerings and acquisitions in february  we completed a public offering of common stock

other than this acquisition  we have accounted for all of our acquisitions since our initial public offering as purchase transactions in our financial statements

together  hsi 
based in san antonio  texas  hsi is a full service provider of computer output solutions including data processing  laser document printing  and automated mailing services 
consideration for this purchase was approximately million in cash and assumed liabilities

 business combinations  we recorded the purchase price at per share  representing the average closing price for the three trading days before and after the announcement of the acquisition 

table of contents in june  we acquired certain item and remittance processing and statement rendering assets from affiliated computer services  inc acs 
the assets include two locations in woodbury and utica  new york 
consideration for this purchase was approximately million plus certain prepaid items 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our expectations of future revenues 
most of our expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to reduce spending quickly if our actual revenues are lower than we expect 
to enhance our long term competitive position  we may also make decisions regarding pricing  marketing  services and technology that could have an adverse near term effect on our financial condition and operating results 
sovereign bank in january  we executed a definitive agreement with sovereign bank for item processing and check imaging services 
sovereign is a billion financial institution headquartered in pennsylvania with approximately community banking offices in new england and the mid atlantic states 
to accommodate the additional business  we plan to open four new item processing centers  expand two existing centers and add approximately new employees 
once we convert all of sovereign bank s item processing and check imaging operations to our centers  sovereign will be our largest customer 
we anticipate that we will recognize more than million in total revenue over the term of the agreement with sovereign 
we issued  shares of our common stock to sovereign upon execution of the letter of intent in october for us to provide sovereign with item processing and check imaging services and the value of the shares will be amortized over the term of the processing agreement 
disappointing results and the outlook for we have previously stated in our sec reports and prospectuses that because of the foregoing factors and other risk factors discussed in our reports  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
we also stated that our operating results were likely to fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter  and that in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps significantly 
unfortunately  we did in fact miss our numbers for the fourth quarter of  and our stock price has indeed fallen substantially 
a significant reason for our disappointing performance in the fourth quarter of was the poor performance of our merchant processing operations  particularly our ibill subsidiary 
to address the issues in our merchant services business  in december we hired john perry to develop a plan for all of our merchant operations 
mr 
perry has reviewed and revised the business plans for all of the merchant businesses and has identified cost reduction opportunities and synergies among the businesses 
he also continued our move to ensure that our businesses and our customers are in compliance with all card association rules 
mr 
perry also has begun to refocus the sales force on financial institutions 
as we announced earlier in march  the result of all these changes is a newly restructured merchant operation that is known as intercept payment solutions 
as we move forward with this business plan  our merchant operations will operate as a single business unit  with a unified management team and a focused strategic direction 
regarding our financial institution services segment  we continue to see sluggishness in item volumes  and believe that the economy continues to affect this area of our business 
through february  our check volumes are approximately flat year over year 
we do not anticipate much growth in this area for the next six months  as we believe that the economy and war concerns will continue to affect our business 
from a product development standpoint  we had no new major developments in our products in  although we did release a new version of our bancpac software in the fourth quarter of initial feedback from our customers has been very positive  and we believe that the enhanced functionality will help new sales in this area 

table of contents on customer service  we implemented an initiative in that we believe has greatly improved our customer service and will enhance future sales 
we added a group of representatives that we refer to as account managers who were initially responsible for relationship management for our core processing customers 
these new employees gave each core customer a single point of contact for all of their customer service issues  greatly improving our customer communications 
with the relationships established  we expect these account managers to focus on driving revenue in and work on utilizing their relationships to cross sell our other products 
in addition  we have added our eft customers to this initiative and believe this will improve that portion of our business as well 
in general  sales of in house core processing systems continue to be very sluggish  but when combined with service bureau sales  total sales of core systems are basically flat year over year 
our pipeline continues to grow  but the sales cycle continues to be rather long 
we have found that the decision makers at the financial institutions continue to be very cautious and conservative when making a decision to change systems 
we have seen the addition of several core processors entering the eft business  which has created some pricing pressure in this area 
we have had to reduce pricing in some cases to make new sales or retain customers 
we believe that the sluggishness we experienced in the fourth quarter was due to the slow holiday season and that the lower volumes are not recurring in nature 
because we are not a bank  we cannot belong to or directly access the visa and mastercard credit card associations or the ach payment network 
to provide transaction services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a member service provider of  mastercard and be designated as an internet payment services provider of visa 
in cases of fraud or disputes between cardholders and merchants  we face charge backs when cardholders dispute items for which they have been billed 
charge backs may arise from the unauthorized use of the cardholder s name or bank account information or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform 
if a billing dispute between a credit card holder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant  and the purchase price is refunded to the cardholder 
if our charge back rate becomes excessive  credit card associations can fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards for payment 
we withhold certain merchant payouts to cover our potential liability for merchant processing card activities including potential charge back penalties 
as noted above we acquired the ibill assets from internet billing company  ltd 
old ibill in april on february   we amended the ibill asset purchase agreement to settle outstanding issues related to the million remaining in the purchase price escrow that secured representations and warranties of the former owners  including those related to potential visa and mastercard fines for excessive charge backs 
under the amendment  we received million from the escrow  and the former owners of old ibill received the million then remaining in the escrow 
in the amendment  the former owners also agreed to eliminate the earnout provisions in the purchase agreement 
we agreed to indemnify the former owners for any claims resulting from processing related activities that occurred before april  we process mastercard and visa transactions through first data 
on march   first data was notified by mastercard of an estimated assessment with respect to ibill s noncompliance with mastercard s charge back rules 
first data notified us that mastercard has reviewed the historical charge back percentages for intercept and old ibill for the period from january  through february  and has determined that those percentages exceeded mastercard s limits 
on march   first data notified us that mastercard had determined the final amount of the assessment to be million 
of the million  million was recorded as an adjustment of the ibill purchase price  million was recorded as an expense for the quarter ended december  and  will be recorded during the first quarter of as of december   first data was holding a reserve of approximately million of money owned to us to cover our potential liability for merchant processing card activities  including potential charge back penalties 
this million amount is included in other noncurrent assets in the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
the mastercard fine will be deducted from that amount 
we believe that first data will maintain a reserve of approximately million going forward and will refund any excess from the reserve to us 
we also face the possibility of fines from visa for similar charge back violations 
before our april acquisition of the ibill assets  visa fined old ibill for excessive charge backs in the months of august and september of and january and february of in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
old ibill also exceeded the visa charge back allowed rate in march  and ibill exceeded the allowed charge back rate in november in addition  visa may deem us to have exceeded its charge back levels in other months  but no fines have been assessed by visa to date 
we have concluded that visa fines in excess of amounts withheld by us from merchant payouts are not probable  and accordingly  we have not recorded a liability under sfas no 
any fines could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we also face the possibility of fines from visa and mastercard for similar charge back violations if we fail to comply with mastercard and visa charge back rules in the future and if visa and or mastercard decide to impose fines 
we cannot predict with certainty whether visa and mastercard will fine us  and if so  the amounts of those fines 
any fines could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations 
as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the year ended december  due to the impairment of certain intangibles related to the acquisitions of ibill and epx 
in our conference call on march  a transcript of which we filed as an exhibit to a current report on form k filed on march  we stated that this impairment charge  coupled with the one time charge of million related to the sale of netzee  would result in our being in default under a financial covenant in our million senior credit facility with wachovia 
the wachovia facility has an outstanding balance of approximately million as of march  as we noted in the conference call  we have been in discussions with wachovia to amend the facility 
we signed an amendment to the credit facility on march  this amendment  a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this annual report  includes the following terms wachovia agreed to waive our compliance with the funded debt to ebitba covenant under the credit agreement through the date of the amendment  we will pay interest at over one month libor  the maturity date of the facility was changed to january  from june   we paid a  fee in connection with the amendment and agreed to pay additional fees of  each on july  and october  if the credit facility is still in effect on those dates  we are required to maintain borrowing availability under the credit facility in an amount not less than million through september  thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million and in an amount not less than million thereafter thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million  and the funded debt to ebitda covenant has been eliminated and replaced with required minimum ebitda amounts for each of the second and third quarters of because the wachovia facility matures on january  and other payments to wachovia are required if the facility remains outstanding  our goal is to refinance the wachovia facility as soon as practicable with another lender or to obtain other financing 
although we believe we will be able to find other financing and pay off wachovia  we cannot assure you that any such new financing will have terms comparable to those of the wachovia facility 
any refinancing may be for a lower principal amount than the amount available under the wachovia facility  and it may have less attractive terms 

table of contents we expect a higher level of capital expenditures and other costs in the first half of the year related to the commencement of item processing services for sovereign bank 
we expect most of the quarter over quarter revenue increase from the sovereign contract to occur in the fourth quarter of as a result of the foregoing  in we expect to be less active in acquiring other businesses than we have been in the past  and we intend to focus on improving our existing operations

the slm loan agreement was amended on september  under the amended loan agreement  the principal increased to million  bearing interest at the prime rate plus 
the slm loan matures on june  and is secured by  shares of intercept common stock 
the loan requires mandatory prepayments from the proceeds of sales of intercept common stock by slm until the loan is repaid in full

the remaining interest is due at the loan maturity date 
on january   slm paid us  from the sale by slm of  shares of our common stock  which satisfied the interest payment due on january  the  intercept shares that secure the remaining million principal balance owed by slm are valued at approximately million as of march  during  we entered into an amended and restated credit facility with wachovia bank  national association formerly named first union national bank 
under this million facility  as amended on march   we are required to maintain borrowing availability under the credit facility in an amount not less than million through september  thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million and in an amount not less than million thereafter thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million

table of contents remaining million to february  we repaid the remaining million to wachovia on january  we are seeking to refinance the wachovia facility with another lender and we believe we will be able to do so 
any refinancing may be for a lower principal amount than the amount available under the wachovia facility  and it may have less attractive terms

interest was payable monthly at prime minus 
at december  under both notes

because intercept is not a bank  it cannot belong to or directly access the visa and mastercard credit card associations or the ach payment network 
to provide transaction processing services  intercept must be designated a certified processor by  and be a member service provider of  mastercard and be designated as an internet payment services provider of visa 
in cases of fraud or disputes between cardholders and merchants  intercept faces charge backs when cardholders dispute items for which they have been billed

if a billing dispute between a credit card holder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant  and the purchase price is refunded to the cardholder 
if intercept s charge back rate becomes excessive  credit card associations can fine intercept or terminate intercept s ability to accept credit cards for payment 
intercept withholds certain merchant payouts for a period of six months to cover its potential liability for merchant processing card activities including potential charge back penalties 
as noted above  we acquired the ibill assets from internet billing company  ltd 
old ibill in april on february   we amended the ibill asset purchase agreement to settle outstanding issues related to the million remaining in the purchase price escrow that secured representations and warranties of the former owners  including those related to potential visa and mastercard fines for excessive charge backs 
under the amendment  we received million from the escrow  and the former owners of old ibill received the million then remaining in the escrow 
in the amendment  the former owners also agreed to eliminate the earnout provisions in the purchase agreement 
we agreed to indemnify the former owners for any claims resulting from processing related activities that occurred before april  we process mastercard and visa transactions through first data 
on march   first data was notified by mastercard of an estimated assessment with respect to ibill s noncompliance with mastercard s charge back rules 
first data notified us that mastercard has reviewed the historical charge back percentages for intercept and old ibill for the period from january  through february  and has determined that those percentages exceeded mastercard s limits 
on march   first data notified intercept that mastercard had determined the final amount of the assessment to be million 
of the million  million was recorded as an adjustment of the ibill purchase price  million was recorded as an expense for the quarter ended december  and  will be recorded during the first quarter of as of december   first data was holding a reserve of approximately million of money owed to us to cover our potential liability for merchant processing card activities  including potential charge back penalties 
this million amount is included in other noncurrent assets in the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
the mastercard fine will be deducted from that amount 
we believe that first data will maintain a reserve of approximately million going forward and will refund any excess from the reserve to us 
we also face the possibility of fines from visa for similar charge back violations 
before our april acquisition of the ibill assets  visa fined old ibill for excessive charge backs in the months of august and september of and january and february of in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
old ibill also exceeded the visa charge back allowed rate in march  and ibill exceeded the allowed charge back rate in november in addition  visa may deem us to have exceeded its charge back levels in other months  but no fines have been assessed by visa to date 
we have concluded that visa fines in excess of amounts withheld by us from merchant payouts are not probable  and accordingly  we have not recorded a liability under sfas no 
any fines could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we also face the possibility of fines from visa and mastercard for similar charge back violations if we fail to comply with mastercard and visa charge back rules in the future and if visa and or mastercard decide to impose fines 
we cannot predict with certainty whether visa and mastercard will fine us  and if so  the amounts of those fines 
any fines could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations we have exhausted or shortly will exhaust the capital resources available to us  and as a result  our operating cash flows will be our principal source of short term liquidity 
we believe that to the extent that we rely on cash flows from operations to meet our short term funding requirements  a decrease in demand for our products and services would not result in a material reduction in the availability of those funds 
because most of our customer contracts require the payment of monthly charges and have original terms of three to five years  we have a high percentage of recurring revenues 
as noted above  we are seeking to refinance the wachovia facility with another lender before the wachovia credit facility matures 
assuming that we are able to replace our wachovia credit facility with a credit facility that provides at least million in borrowing availability  we believe that borrowings from that facility and funds provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital expenditures and liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
given the reduction in the amount available to be drawn under the wachovia facility and the substantial capital and other expenses related to the sovereign bank agreement  however  our liquidity will be significantly curtailed during unless and until we replace the wachovia facility with another credit facility with higher borrowing availability 
we can give no assurances that we will obtain a replacement facility 
if we do obtain a replacement facility  it may have a lower borrowing availability than the wachovia facility  and it may have less attractive terms 
historically  we have grown  in part  through strategic acquisitions 
assuming we are able to raise additional capital or obtain sufficient credit  we expect to make additional expenditures to make acquisitions and integrate the acquired companies 
we can give no assurances with respect to the actual timing and amount of the capital we raise or of the acquisitions we may make with the capital so raised 
in addition  we can give no assurance that we will complete any acquisitions on terms favorable to us  if at all  or that additional sources of financing will be available to us 
as a result of the foregoing  in we expect to be significantly less active in acquiring other businesses that we have been in the past  and we intend to focus on improving our existing operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments and affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues include service fees  debit and credit card processing fees  data communication management fees  revenues from equipment sales  installation and maintenance  software license fees  and software maintenance fees 
we recognize service fee income and data communication management fees as services are performed 
we recognize 
table of contents revenue from equipment sales and installations upon installation of the product  and we recognize any related maintenance revenue ratably over the period during which the services are performed 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our core data processing systems 
we recognize revenue for licensing these systems in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  using the residual method prescribed in sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we recognize software license  hardware and installation revenue after we have a signed non cancelable license agreement  have installed the products and have fulfilled all significant obligations to the customer 
we recognize maintenance fees over the term of the maintenance period 
we sell some of our software and hardware products under five year  sales type lease agreements under which customers make annual installment payments 
these annual payments include the initial installation and an ongoing license fee 
revenue attributable to installation fees and the sale of equipment is recognized upon installation 
license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the lease 
merchant processing services revenues are recognized as services are performed 
our service offerings allow merchants to accept and process real time payments for goods and services purchased over the internet using our merchant account  in which event revenue recognized is equal to service fees that we charge to the merchant 
this fee is generally based on a percentage of the total transaction amount 
merchants can also establish their own merchant account with our acquiring bank partners and utilize our end to end processing solution  which eliminates the need for the merchant to establish multiple relationships with banks  front end system providers  gateways  and back end processors 
we recognize revenues related to this service offering net of certain costs that we do not control primarily interchange and other fees charged by credit card associations 
for merchants using our merchant account  we establish and hold rolling reserves for merchant credit losses that arise as a result of  among other things  disputes between cardholders and merchants 
if disputes are not resolved in the merchant s favor  the transaction is charged back to us and the purchase price is refunded to the merchant s customer 
if we are unable to collect from the merchant  we bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction 
our acquiring bank partners also establish and hold reserves for merchant credit losses for merchants using our end to end solution 
if transactions are charged back to our banks and our banks are unable to collect from the merchants  we bear the credit risk for amounts in excess of reserves held by the banks 

table of contents commitments and contingencies we record commitments and contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that when a loss contingency exists  the likelihood that the contingency will result in the impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability be identified as remote  reasonably possible or probable 
the identification as remote  reasonable possible or probable and whether the amount can be reasonably estimated determines whether the potential loss is recorded in the financial statements or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements or both 
as described in detail above in liquidity and capital resources  we have been fined by mastercard and may be fined by visa 
on march   first data was notified by mastercard of an estimated assessment with respect to ibill s noncompliance with mastercard s charge back rules 
first data notified us that mastercard has reviewed the historical charge back percentages for intercept and old ibill for the period from january  through february  and has determined that those percentages have exceeded mastercard s limits 
on march   first data notified intercept that mastercard had determined the final amount of the assessment to be million 
of the million  million was recorded as an adjustment of the ibill purchase price  million was recorded as an expense for the quarter ended december  and  will be recorded during the first quarter of as of december   first data was holding a reserve of approximately million of money owed to us to cover our potential liability for merchant processing card activities  including potential charge back penalties 
this million amount is included in other noncurrent assets in the balance sheet contained in our consolidated financial statements 
the mastercard fine will be deducted from that amount 
we have concluded that the probability of visa fines in excess of amounts withheld from merchant payouts is reasonably possible  but not probable  and accordingly  we have not recorded a liability under sfas no 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or when visa will fine us  and if so  the amounts of those fines 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to customer receivables balances 
we develop estimates by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss as well as historical credit memo data and other known factors for billing disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations our purchase combinations require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business 
in general  we determine the fair value based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets 
these assets are being amortized over the expected economic lives of the assets  generally ranging from five to years 
we are required to evaluate the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets that are being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
we are also required to test the carrying amount of these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  our revenues and earnings for our merchant services segment fell below original estimates due to several factors  including the implementation of new credit card association rules in november  the termination of certain merchants due to noncompliance with credit card association rules and the transfer of ibill s transaction processing from epx to a third party processor 
as a result  we determined that the carrying amounts of intangible assets in the merchant services segment may not be recoverable 
we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the assets and compared the amounts to the carrying values of the assets 
based on this comparison  we determined that certain assets were impaired 
in order to quantify the impairment loss  we estimated the fair value of the assets based on the discounted future cash flows associated with the assets and recorded an impairment loss of million equal to the difference in the fair value and carrying amount of the assets 
we also evaluated the remaining useful lives of our intangible assets subject to amortization 
based on changes in merchant attrition rates in the epx reporting unit  we have shortened the useful life of epx customer relationships from years to years 
we will amortize the revised carrying amount after the impairment loss above based on a year life 
we concluded that the remaining useful lives of all other intangible assets were appropriate as of december  we will continue to evaluate these lives on an annual basis  and if we determine that we have over estimated the economic life of these assets  we will begin to amortize the remaining unamortized carrying value of the assets over the newly estimated life 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense could be increased  and the amount of any increase could be material to our results of operations 

table of contents we also recorded a significant amount of goodwill in connection with our acquisitions 
through the end of  we evaluated goodwill for impairment whenever indicators of impairment existed based on undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the goodwill were less than the undiscounted projected future cash flows  no impairment would be recognized 
beginning in  we are required to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation will be based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the unit of our business to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation will be estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit as well as comparable industry revenue and earnings multiples 
these cash flow projections will be based on a number of assumptions as discussed above 
investment in and advances to netzee until december   we owned approximately of netzee s common stock 
we accounted for our investment in netzee using the equity method of accounting  under which the operations of netzee were recorded on a single line item in our statements of operations  equity in loss of affiliate 
we did not consolidate netzee s results of operations with our results of operations 
we reviewed our investment in netzee in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
apb opinion no 
provides that a loss in value of an investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized 
we compared our carrying value of the investment to the fair market value of the stock over time in order to determine when a loss in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
for the three months ended march   we continued to record equity method losses in netzee  resulting in the reduction of our investment in common stock of netzee to zero 
beginning in the second quarter of  we then applied eitf  percentage used to determine the amount of equity method losses  which addresses the percentage of ownership that an investor should use to compute equity method losses when the investment in a company s common stock has been reduced to zero and the investor holds other securities of the company such as preferred stock or loans to the company 
netzee had preferred stock outstanding  we owned none of that preferred stock 
netzee also had an million line of credit  of which we loaned or were obligated to loan approximately 
under eitf  we did not record any additional equity method losses until the preferred stockholders had reduced their investments to zero by absorbing million of losses 
during the three months ended september   we used our relative ownership percentage in the next most senior level of capital the line of credit to record our share of netzee s losses 
on december   certegy  inc acquired substantially all of the assets of netzee 
we received approximately million in payment on our line of credit and  for our netzee stock resulting in a loss of million 
this loss is included in equity in loss of affiliate

projections or estimates of our future performance are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and may vary materially from actual results 
in evaluating forward looking statements  please carefully consider the various factors discussed below 

table of contents risks related to our operations our rapid growth could strain our managerial  operational and financial resources  and our failure to manage our growth could cause our business to suffer 
our internal growth and acquisitions since our initial public offering in june have placed great demands on our business  particularly our managerial  operational and financial personnel and systems 
for example  we have grown from approximately employees on march  to approximately  employees on march  additional internal growth and acquisitions may further strain our resources 
we can provide no assurances that our systems  procedures  controls and existing facilities will be adequate to support the expansion of our operations  while maintaining adequate levels of customer service and satisfaction 
our future operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
our failure to respond to and manage changing business conditions as we expand could diminish the quality of our products and services  result in the loss of customers and weaken our operating results 
the failure to sustain our current growth rates or to achieve expected growth rates could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant growth since our inception 
our revenues have increased from million in to million for this revenue growth is attributed to both internal growth of our business  as well as revenue growth achieved through acquisitions we have completed 
our growth rate declined in the fourth quarter of  and we failed to achieve growth rates expected by stock market analysts 
our stock price has declined substantially 
either our internal growth rate or our total growth rate  or both  may again decline in the future due to factors within or beyond our control 
our failure to sustain our growth rates  or achieve growth rates expected by stock market analysts  could again have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
our acquisitions have resulted and could again result in integration difficulties  unexpected expenses  diversion of management s attention and other negative consequences 
as part of our growth strategy  we have made numerous acquisitions since our initial public offering in june  and in we acquired ibill  epx now intercept payment solutions and the item processing assets of acs 
assuming we have access to adequate levels of debt and equity capital  we plan to continue to acquire complementary businesses  products and services as a key element of our growth strategy 
we must integrate the technology  products and services  operations  systems and personnel of acquired businesses with our own and attempt to grow the acquired businesses as part of our company 
the integration of other businesses is a complex process and places significant demands on our management  financial  technical and other resources 
the successful integration of businesses we have acquired in the past and may acquire in the future is critical to our future success 
if we are unsuccessful in integrating these businesses  our financial and operating performance could suffer 
the risks and challenges associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses include we may be unable to centralize and consolidate our financial  operational and administrative functions with those of the businesses we acquire  our management s attention may be diverted from other business concerns  we may be unable to retain and motivate key employees of an acquired company  we may enter markets in which we have little or no prior direct experience  litigation  indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses  the costs necessary to complete integration may exceed our expectations or outweigh some of the intended benefits of the transactions we complete  we may be unable to maintain the customers or goodwill of an acquired business  and 
table of contents the costs necessary to improve or replace the operating systems  products and services of acquired businesses may exceed our expectations 
we may be unable to integrate our acquisitions successfully with our operations on schedule or at all 
we have been forced to deal with many of the risks listed above in connection with our acquisitions of ibill and epx 
we can provide no assurances that we will not incur large accounting charges or other expenses in connection with acquisitions 
we have in fact incurred a large impairment charge in connection with our acquisitions of ibill and epx  and we can provide no assurances that we can avoid incurring similar charges in the future if these businesses do not perform as we expect 
further  we can provide no assurances that acquisitions will result in cost savings or sufficient revenues or earnings to justify our investment in  or our expenses related to  these acquisitions 
the slower economy in the united states may continue to affect our operations adversely 
we continue to see sluggishness in item volumes in our financial institution services segment  and we believe that the economy continues to affect this part of our business 
we believe that the economy and the unsettled international situation will continue to influence transaction volumes negatively 
this problem may be exacerbated if the conflict with iraq is not resolved quickly and if additional events of terrorism occur within the united states 
if we do not continue to expand our sales force and our marketing relationships  we may be unable to continue our growth 
our ability to expand our business will depend significantly upon our ability to expand our sales and marketing force and our strategic marketing relationships 
competition for experienced sales and marketing personnel is intense  and we may not be able to retain our existing personnel or locate and attract additional qualified personnel in the future 
in addition  if we lose any of the relationships with various banking related organizations for the marketing and endorsement of our products and services or are unable to enter into new ones  growth in our customer base and revenues could be impaired 
competition may impede our ability to acquire other businesses and may inhibit our growth 
a significant part of our historic growth has been generated by acquisitions 
we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished through acquisitions  although we expect to focus on improving our current operations until we have access to the debt and equity capital we need to finance acquisitions 
the success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  reach agreements to acquire these companies and obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities  we may compete with other companies that have similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
this competition may render us unable to acquire businesses that could improve our growth or expand our operations 
this competition will be particularly strong  given our current stock price and limited access to capital 
the decline in our stock price may impair our ability to acquire other businesses 
we have financed the acquisitions we have completed since our initial public offering with a combination of our common stock  cash from common stock offerings  cash from our operations and borrowings made under our line of credit with wachovia bank 
because our stock price has declined substantially from its historical high in early  the shareholders of businesses that we seek to acquire may be unwilling to accept our common stock in exchange for their businesses 
as a result  we will be required to use larger portions of our line of credit which may already be fully drawn for other purposes or cash from operations to continue to complete acquisitions  which would decrease our working capital and increase our interest expense 
because we are required under our line of credit with wachovia bank to maintain borrowing availability under the credit facility in an amount not less than million through september  thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million and in an amount not less than thus the outstanding balance cannot exceed million million thereafter  our ability to draw on this line of credit to acquire other businesses and assets has been substantially restricted 
this could have a material negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations 
our credit facility with wachovia bank restricts our ability to complete acquisitions without the bank s consent 

table of contents we must comply with the financial and other covenants of the credit facility with wachovia to be able to draw on our credit facility to fund our acquisitions 
in addition  wachovia must approve any acquisition by us that has a purchase price in excess of million 
if we are unable to borrow funds under our credit line  we may be unable to make acquisitions that could be helpful to our business 
the loss of our chief executive officer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
john w 
collins  our chief executive officer  has substantial experience with our operations and our industry and has contributed significantly to our growth 
although we maintain key man life insurance on mr 
collins and we have an employment agreement with him  our customer and marketing relationships would likely be impaired and our business would likely suffer if we lost the services of mr 
collins for any reason 
if our processing centers or communications network suffers a systems failure or interruption  we may face customer service issues and be liable for damage suffered by our customers 
our operations depend upon our ability to protect our processing centers  network infrastructure and equipment 
damage to our systems or equipment or those of third parties that we use may be caused by natural disasters  human error  power and telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
although we do have data and item processing centers in several locations that serve as back ups for each other  we maintain only a single data communications switching facility and do not maintain a back up location for our frame relay network hardware 
interruption in our processing or communications services could delay transfers of our customers data  or damage or destroy the data 
sudden increases in atm usage or debit card activity could result in slow response times in our network 
any of these occurrences could result in lawsuits or loss of customers and may also harm our reputation 
we depend on other providers for products and services necessary to our business  and if we cannot obtain satisfactory products and services on favorable terms  or at all  our business could suffer 
we rely on other providers for internet and telephone banking products and services  atm and debit card manufacturing  fiber optic communications and other products and services that are essential to our business 
if any of these providers is permanently or temporarily unable to provide its products and services to us as the result of natural disasters  technical difficulties or otherwise  we may be unable to provide our products and services to our customers 
if the performance of these third party products and services does not meet our customers expectations  it may damage our current customer relationships  harm our reputation and inhibit our ability to obtain new customers 
we depend on worldcom for various services  and its bankruptcy could negatively affect our business 
worldcom provides various services to us  including frame relay circuits  network and internet backbone and collection for web billing 
if worldcom s services are interrupted for any reason  including its bankruptcy  we could experience a disruption in the services that we provide to our customers 
any interruption of services by worldcom could force us to seek other vendors to provide these services  which could increase our costs  result in delays or disruptions in our own services or make it difficult or impossible to provide the services if we cannot engage another vendor 
during the third quarter of  ibill s web service provider  icn ltd  withheld certain amounts from ibill because worldcom did not send the monies to icn 
intercept reserved million  which represents deposits held for web billing  amounts that ibill has paid to its merchants but not received from icn  and related gross profits 
during the fourth quarter of  icn sold its receivables to a third party and paid us  which reduced the reserve to million 
we have fully reserved for this account receivable and are seeking to recover the amounts owed  but we can offer no assurances that these efforts will be successful 

table of contents if our products and services contain errors  we may lose customers and revenues and be subject to claims for damages 
our new products and services  and enhancements to our existing products and services  may have undetected errors or failures  or could fail to achieve market acceptance  despite testing by our current and potential customers and by us 
if we discover errors after we have introduced a new or updated product to the marketplace  we could experience  among other things delayed or lost revenues while we correct the errors  a loss of customers or delay in market acceptance  and additional and unexpected expenses to fund further product development 
our agreements with our customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
these provisions may not be effective because of existing or future federal  state or local laws or ordinances  or unfavorable judicial decisions 
if our products and services fail to function properly  we could be subject to product liability claims  which could result in increased litigation expense  damage awards and harm to our business reputation 
our failure to successfully convert existing customers to our new eft platform or customer dissatisfaction with that platform could cause a loss of revenue 
the current mainframe computer that we use to run our eft platform has reached its limit for expansion 
in order to accommodate our anticipated growth in eft transaction volume  we have substantially rewritten our eft platform software to run on a stratus mainframe computer 
although we have tested the new platform software  as we convert customers to this new platform  we could experience software errors or conversion problems 
in addition  we could lose customers if they are dissatisfied with our new platform 
if these errors or problems cause us to lose customers  it may cause a loss of revenue and adversely impact our business 
because our business involves the electronic storage and transmission of data  security breaches and computer viruses could adversely affect us 
our online transaction processing systems electronically store and transmit sensitive business information of our customers 
the difficulty of securely storing confidential information electronically has been a significant issue in conducting electronic transactions 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  such as banking records or credit information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and terminate their agreements with us  and could inhibit our ability to attract new customers 
technological changes may reduce the demand for our products and services or render them obsolete 
the introduction of new technologies and financial products and services can render existing technology products and services obsolete 
we expect other vendors to introduce new products and services  as well as enhancements to their existing products and services  that will compete with our products and services 
to be successful  we must anticipate evolving industry trends  continue to apply advances in technology  enhance our existing products and services and develop or acquire new products and services to meet the demands of our customers 
we may not be successful in developing  acquiring or marketing new or enhanced products or services that respond to technological change or evolving customer needs 
we may also incur substantial costs in developing and employing new technologies 
if we fail to adapt to changes in technologies  we could lose customers and revenues  and fail to attract new customers or otherwise realize the benefits of costs we incur 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights 
we attempt to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  which afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or 
table of contents obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we cannot be sure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
if others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights  we could be liable for significant damages 
we do not believe that any of intercept s products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot be sure  however  that others will not make infringement claims  and we have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against those claims 
we anticipate that the number of infringement claims will increase as the number of products and services increases and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
any of those claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us 
fluctuations in our operating results have negatively affected the trading price of our common stock and may do so again 
our operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of many factors 
these factors include the possible negative impact of implementing our growth and acquisition strategies  including accounting charges and other expenses associated with our acquisitions  the loss of customers or strategic relationships  competition and pricing pressures  a reduction in recurring revenues as a percentage of total revenues  increased operating expenses due to launches of new products and services  and sales and marketing efforts  changes in interchange and transaction fees of mastercard and visa  and fines from non compliance with mastercard and visa regulations 
many factors that affect our operating results are outside of our control 
because of these factors  it is likely that in some future period our financial results will again fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline  perhaps significantly 
if we fail to comply with privacy regulations imposed on providers of services to financial institutions  our business could be harmed 
as a provider of services to financial institutions  we are required to comply with privacy regulations 
we are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could damage our customer relationships  harm our reputation and inhibit our ability to obtain new customers 
our limited combined operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
since our incorporation in may  we have completed numerous acquisitions  including several large acquisitions in we have a limited combined operating history  and our historical results of operations and our other financial information may not be an accurate indication of our future results of operations or prospects 

table of contents risks related to our merchant services operations our business depends upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship  and loss or suspension of this certification and sponsorship could adversely affect our business 
because we are not a bank  we cannot belong to or directly access the visa and mastercard credit card associations or the ach payment network 
to provide our transaction processing services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a member service provider of  mastercard and be designated as an internet payment services provider of visa 
these designations depend on our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with these standards  our designation as a certified processor  a member service provider or an internet payment services provider could be suspended or terminated 
the termination of our member service provider status or our status as a certified processor  or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration  or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations may increase our costs of compliance with those rules  could result in the loss of business from visa or mastercard customers  and could lead to a severe reduction in our transactions and an increase in our chargeback percentages 
if member banks were to decline to sponsor us  we would be unable to process transactions for our customers  which could cause our revenues to decline significantly 
we may have difficulty in complying with a new visa rule 
visa implemented a new rule that became effective november  this rule identified ibill as an internet payment service provider and required ibill to register all of its clients as sponsored merchants 
a registration fee was assessed to ibill for each sponsored merchant  and ibill in turn collected a registration fee from its sponsored merchants in the united states 
under the rule  the geographic location of each sponsored merchant is disclosed to the internet consumer 
additionally  we are not able to acquire transactions on behalf of foreign sponsored merchants  unless the transaction is from an acquirer within the sponsored merchant s region 
we have established relationships with a foreign bank to serve as ibill s acquiring bank 
if we fail to comply with the new visa rule  visa may fine our acquiring bank  which will in turn seek indemnification from us 
if our charge back rate is excessive  credit card associations can fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards for payment 
in cases of fraud or disputes between cardholders and merchants  we face charge backs when cardholders dispute items for which they have been billed 
charge backs may arise from the unauthorized use of the cardholder s name or bank account information or from a cardholder s claim that a merchant failed to perform 
if a billing dispute between a credit card holder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant  the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant  and the purchase price is refunded to the cardholder 
if our charge back rate becomes excessive  credit card associations can fine us or terminate our ability to accept credit cards for payment 
if we are prohibited from accepting credit cards for payment  our ability to compete could be impaired and our business would suffer 
we have been informed that mastercard has reviewed our charge back percentages  has determined that those charge back percentages have exceeded mastercard s limits and has imposed a fine of approximately million on us 
continued fines of this magnitude would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we also face the possibility of fines from visa for similar chargeback violations 

table of contents we cannot predict with certainty  however  whether or when mastercard or visa will fine us  and if so  the amounts of those fines 
in addition to the risk of possible fines  either or both mastercard or visa could terminate our ability to accept their credit cards for payment  which would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in card association fees  products or practices could increase our costs or otherwise limit our operations 
in march  mastercard implemented a new rule that requires all banks that submit transactions on behalf of a merchant to have a valid merchant agreement with that merchant 
this rule applies whether the card is presented directly to the merchant or to a third party payment facilitator  such as ibill 
mastercard has notified ibill s former and current acquiring banks for mastercard transactions that ibill has acquired transactions from merchants without the required merchant agreements 
as a result of this noncompliance  mastercard has stated that it will impose assessments on the acquiring banks of  per day  retroactive to the day that the first noncompliant transaction was acquired through ibill 
the total amount of this fine through february  is approximately  ibill anticipates that the acquiring banks will seek indemnification for this amount 
mastercard has also requested that ibill and its acquiring bank submit a plan for compliance with this rule and provide a listing of all merchants selling goods and services through ibill and the urls associated with those merchants 
although ibill intends to submit the required plan to mastercard  the failure to submit the plan or the submission of plan that does meet mastercard s requirements will result in additional fines and could result in the inability of ibill to process mastercard transactions 
from time to time  visa  mastercard  discover  american express and diners club increase the organization and or processing fees known as interchange fees that they charge for each transaction using their card 
for example  in april  visa and mastercard increased their fees by up to 
competitive pressures might force us to absorb a portion of those increases in the future  which would increase our operating costs and reduce our margins 
furthermore  the rules and regulations of the various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements for settlement banks 
any increase in that capital requirement may adversely affect a bank s ability to serve as our settlement bank 
online payment processing systems might be used for illegal or improper purposes  which could expose us to additional liability and harm our business 
despite our efforts to review and monitor the types of transactions we process  all online payment processing systems remain susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses 
these may include illegal online gaming  fraudulent sales of goods and services  software and other intellectual property piracy  child pornography trafficking  prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products and online securities fraud 
our business could suffer if customers use our system for illegal or improper purposes 
our product features may infringe the patents of others  which could affect our business and profitability 
we could be sued for patent infringement 
if all or any portion of our service were found to infringe a patent and we are unable to obtain a license  or if a preliminary injunction were issued  we could be required to restructure our payment system  stop offering our payment product altogether  or pay substantial damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we prevail in a lawsuit  litigation can be expensive and can consume substantial amounts of management time and attention 
because some of the transactions we process are for the adult entertainment industry  our reputation with our customers and in the investment community may be harmed and the price of our common stock may decline 
we process transactions for merchants in many different industries  including the adult entertainment industry 
certain current and potential customers as well as investors  lenders  and others may be reluctant or refuse to do business with us  participate in the market for our common stock  provide financing  or offer related services 
table of contents because we process transactions for the adult entertainment industry 
this may negatively affect our business  financial results  the price of our common stock or limit our ability to raise capital in the future 
our customers may not adopt our online payment methods as soon as we intend  which would limit our growth and may cause our stock price to decline 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to implement our strategy to increase adoption of our online payment methods 
we can provide no assurances that the relatively new market for online payment mechanisms will remain viable 
we expect to invest substantial amounts to drive merchant awareness of electronic payments  to encourage merchants to sign up for and use our electronic payment products  to enhance our infrastructure to handle seamless processing of transactions  to continue to develop our technology  to diversify our customer base  and to establish international relationships 
we may fail to increase the adoption of our electronic payment methods as we intend  which would adversely affect revenues and cause our business to suffer 
we face strong competition in the merchant processing and online processing businesses 
in our online processing business  we compete with other online processing companies 
in our merchant processing business  we compete with large merchant processors like chase merchant services  national processing company  paymentech  us bancorp nova  first data corporation  concord efs and others 
in each of these areas  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other existing or new competitors 
risks related to financial institution services industry because many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do  we may be unable to gain market share 
because our business includes a variety of products and services  we generally face different competitors within each area of our business 
in our core banking and data processing business  we compete with numerous companies that have national operations and significant assets 
our principal eft competitors include regional atm networks  regional and local banks that perform processing functions  non bank processors and other independent technology and data communications organizations 
in each of these areas  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and substantially greater resources than we do 
if we compete with them for the same geographic market  their financial strength could prevent us from capturing market share in those areas 
in addition  the competitive pricing pressures that would result from an increase in competition from these companies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our competitors have established cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customer needs 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
if we fail to adapt to emerging market demands or to compete successfully with existing and new competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if current legal actions against visa and mastercard result in a reduction of the interchange fees those companies may charge  our revenues may decrease 
we generate a significant amount of revenue from interchange fees  which are the interbank fees paid by merchants when they accept credit and debit cards 
visa and mastercard set the interchange fees 
visa and mastercard have been sued by the department of justice  or doj  for alleged violation of the federal antitrust laws arising out of their respective functionally identical policies of a allowing members in the respective organization to issue cards participating in the other organization s system  and b prohibiting their members from issuing cards in competing systems other than visa  mastercard or citigroup  the largest owner member of visa and mastercard 
the potential impact of this litigation on us depends upon whether or not the doj is successful  and if it is successful  the relief ordered by the court 
visa and mastercard also have been sued in a class action case brought by merchants who allege that visa and mastercard s tying rules which require merchants who accept visa and mastercard credit cards to accept all cards associated with their logos  including debit cards violate antitrust laws 
the merchants contend that the visa and mastercard interchange fees for debit cards are too high and that they should be able to choose whether to accept those debit cards 
if this class action lawsuit is successful and the interchange fees that visa and mastercard charge merchants are reduced  the revenues that we derive from interchange fees could be materially reduced 
financial institutions are subject to industry consolidation  and we may lose customers with little notice 
the banking industry is prone to consolidations that result from mergers and acquisitions 
our existing customers may be acquired by or merged with other financial institutions 
any purchase or merger may result in a lost customer for us because the acquiring financial institution may not use our products and services 
although we have included in most of our contracts a charge for early termination of the contract without cause  these charges would be insufficient to replace the recurring revenues that we would have received if the financial institution had continued as a customer 
we face risks in connection with our contract with sovereign bank 
in january  we executed a definitive agreement with sovereign bank to provide sovereign with item processing and check imaging services 
once we convert all of sovereign bank s item processing and check imaging operations to our centers  sovereign will be our largest customer 
we anticipate that we will recognize more than million in total revenue over the term of the agreement with sovereign 
to accommodate the sovereign business  we must incur substantial costs to open four new item processing centers  expand two existing centers and add approximately new employees 
sovereign can terminate the agreement at any time for convenience and in that event would be required to pay us liquidated damages 
although the amount of those damages would be significant  they may not compensate us adequately for the loss of the business 
sovereign also has the ability to terminate the agreement without paying liquidated damages for various events of default that include sovereign s reasonable belief that its prospects of receiving services from us are materially impaired due to the occurrence of a material adverse change  as defined in the agreement 
depending on when a termination of the sovereign agreement occurred  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
the banking industry is highly regulated  and changes in banking regulations could negatively affect our business 
our banking customers are subject to the supervision of several state and federal government regulatory agencies 
if bank regulations change  or if new regulations are adopted to regulate the products and services offered or used by community financial institutions  we could suffer an increase in the costs of providing our products and services 
moreover  if any new or revised regulations diminish the need for our services  we could lose customers and suffer a decline in revenues 
we are subject to government and private regulation  and an increase in regulatory requirements or tax burdens could place a strain on our business 
various federal and state regulatory agencies examine our operations from time to time 
these agencies can make findings or recommendations regarding various aspects of our operations  and we generally must follow those recommendations to continue our data processing operations 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  our operations and processing revenues could be negatively affected 
our atm network operations are subject to federal regulations governing consumers rights 
fees charged by atm owners are currently regulated in several states  and legislation regulating atm fees has been proposed in several other states 
additional legislation may be proposed and enacted in the future  or existing consumer protection laws may be expanded to apply to atm fees 
if the number of atms decreases as a result of such legislation  then our eft revenues may decline 
furthermore  we are subject to the regulations and policies of various atm and debit card associations and networks 
if we lost our privileges to provide transaction processing 
table of contents services across these networks  our revenues from atm and debit card transaction processing would decrease significantly 
as a transaction processing company  we may be subject to state taxation of certain portions of the fees charged for our services 
application of this tax is an emerging issue in the industry  and the states have not yet adopted uniform guidelines implementing these regulations 
if we are required to bear all or a portion of these costs and are unable to pass these costs through to our customers  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
other risks of owning our stock a few people control a large portion of our stock and may vote their shares in ways contrary to our shareholders interests 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  our executive officers and directors can exercise control over our company and have the power to influence the election of a majority of the directors  the appointment of management and the approval of actions requiring a majority vote of our shareholders 
their interests may conflict with our shareholders interest  and our executive officers and directors could use their power to delay or prevent a change in control  even if a majority of the shareholders desired a change 
future sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
to carry out our growth strategies  we may acquire other businesses and products using a combination of our stock and cash  and we may also sell additional shares of our stock to raise money for expanding our operations 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market or the prospect of such sales could adversely affect the market for our common stock 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and options outstanding to acquire an additional  shares of common stock 
additionally  we have reserved  shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and approximately million shares for options that may be granted in the future under our stock option plans  and issuances pursuant to these plans will also dilute our existing shareholders ownership interest in the company 
georgia law  our articles of incorporation and bylaws and some of our employment agreements contain provisions that could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire our outstanding shares at a premium to the market price 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation  our bylaws and georgia law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
some of our executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us that contain change in control provisions 
these provisions may discourage or prevent a tender offer  proxy contest or other attempted takeover 
in addition  we have in the past and may in the future create and issue new classes of preferred stock that have greater rights than our common stock 
these superior rights may include greater voting rights  entitlement to dividends and preferential treatment in the event of a change in control  liquidation  consolidation or other circumstances 
any shares of preferred stock that we issue may discourage a third party from attempting to acquire our shares of common stock at a premium price 

table of contents we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business and  therefore  the risks and uncertainties discussed above may not be the only ones we face 
the risks and uncertainties discussed above are in addition to those that apply to most businesses generally 
in addition  as we continue to grow our business  we may encounter other risks of which we are not aware at this time 
these additional risks may cause serious damage to our business in the future  the impact of which we cannot estimate at this time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investments and do not have significant operations subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank accrue interest at a fluctuating rate based upon the libor 
as of march   approximately was outstanding under this facility 
any future borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates that increase the interest rate on the credit facility would make it more costly to borrow under that facility and may impede our acquisition and growth strategies if we determine that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
we owed million to the peoples bank of winder on december  on january  we borrowed million from the bankers bank and repaid the amounts owed to the peoples bank of winder 
the loan is secured by certificates of deposit in amounts equal to the principal amounts of the loans 
interest on this loan is based on the prime rate 
changes in interest rates that increase the interest rate by would increase our interest expense by approximately  per year 
we have loaned slm million 
in january  slm repaid approximately  of this debt  leaving a balance of million 
changes in interest rates that decrease the interest rate on this loan will decrease our interest income
