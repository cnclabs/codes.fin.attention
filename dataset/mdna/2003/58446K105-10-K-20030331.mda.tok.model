item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors below for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and organization mediacom communications corporation was organized as a delaware corporation in november and completed an initial public offering in february immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we issued shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding membership interests in mediacom llc  a new york limited liability company  upon which mediacom llc became our wholly owned subsidiary 
mediacom llc commenced operations in march and until june served as the holding company for all of our operating subsidiaries 
mediacom broadband llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  was organized as a delaware limited company in april for the purpose of acquiring cable systems from at t broadband  llc 
mediacom broadband llc s operating subsidiaries completed the acquisitions of the at t cable systems in june and july until our initial public offering in february  mediacom management corporation  a delaware corporation  provided management services to the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc under management agreements and received annual management fees 
such management agreements were terminated upon the date of our initial public offering 
at that time  mediacom management s employees became our employees and its corporate overhead became our corporate overhead 
these employee expenses and corporate overhead are reflected as our corporate expenses 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions we significantly expanded our business in the last three years through acquisitions 
all acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  our historical results of operations include the results of operations for each acquired system subsequent to its respective acquisition date 
on june   we acquired from at t broadband  llc cable systems in the state of missouri serving approximately  basic subscribers for a purchase price of approximately million 
on july   we acquired from at t broadband cable systems in the states of georgia  illinois and iowa serving approximately  basic subscribers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
in  we acquired cable systems serving a total of  basic subscribers as of their respective dates of acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of million the acquisitions 
these acquisitions affect the comparability of our historical results of operations 
general we have generated significant increases in revenues principally as a result of our acquisition activities and increases in monthly revenues per basic subscriber 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  are attributable to video revenues from monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television services  including basic  expanded basic and premium programming  digital cable television programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental  services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation and reconnection fees  late payment fees and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues from cable modem service and advertising revenues represent and of our revenues  respectively 
franchise fees charged to customers are included in their corresponding revenue category 
our operating expenses consist of service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses directly attributable to our cable systems 
service costs include fees paid to programming suppliers  expenses related to copyright fees  wages and salaries of technical personnel  high speed internet access costs and plant operating costs 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation due to the introduction of new programming services and to increases in the rates charged for existing programming services 
under the federal communication commission s existing cable rate regulations  we are allowed to increase our rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in the programming and copyright costs 
however  competitive conditions or other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for customer service and administrative personnel  franchise fees and expenses related to billing  marketing  bad debt  advertising and office administration 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
the high level of depreciation and amortization associated with our acquisition activities and capital investment program  as well as the interest expense related to our financing activities  have caused us to report net losses 
we believe that such net losses are common for cable television companies and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
actual results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following historical information includes the results of operations of the at t cable systems  acquired in june and july  only for that portion of the respective period that we owned such cable systems

depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to the depreciation and amortization expense associated with our purchase of the at t cable systems and ongoing investments in our cable systems 
this increase was substantially offset by the adoption of sfas  effective january   which reduced amortization expense by million during the year ended december  non cash stock charges relating to corporate expenses 
non cash stock charges relating to corporate expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this charge represented vesting in equity interests granted to certain members of mcc s management team in during the year ended december   the vesting in such equity interests was accelerated  and accordingly  the remainder of the related charges were expensed 
interest expense  net

non cash stock charges relating to corporate expenses 
non cash stock charges relating to corporate expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a one time million charge which occurred in february  resulting from the termination of the management agreements with mediacom management on the date of our initial public offering

in addition  we have pursued  and will continue to pursue  a business strategy that includes selective acquisitions 
we have funded and will continue to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions through a combination of internally generated funds  long term borrowings and equity financings 
operating activities cash provided by operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
there were significant working capital sources relating to the acquisitions of the at t cable systems in that did not recur in investing activities cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and billion  respectively 
in  we completed the acquisitions of the at t cable systems 
in  we did not complete any significant acquisitions of cable systems 
our capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the higher capital expenditures in reflect the significant investments we have made as a result of our accelerated network upgrade program and our ownership of the at t cable systems for the full year 
as of december   as a result of our cumulative capital investment in our network upgrade program  approximately of our cable network was upgraded with mhz to mhz bandwidth capacity and about of our homes passed were activated with two way communications capability 
at year end  our digital cable service was available to approximately million basic subscribers  and our cable modem service was marketed to about million homes passed by our cable systems 
we expect to complete our planned network upgrade program by june  at which time we anticipate that approximately of our cable network will be upgraded with mhz to mhz bandwidth capacity with two way communications capability 
to achieve these targets and to fund other requirements  including the infrastructure for our high speed internet service  cable modems  digital converters  new plant construction  headend eliminations  regional fiber interconnections and network replacement  we expect to invest between million and million in capital expenditures in on june   we completed the acquisition of at t cable systems serving approximately  basic subscribers in missouri 
the purchase price for these cable systems was approximately million 
on july   we completed the acquisition of at t cable systems serving approximately  basic subscribers in georgia  illinois and iowa 
the aggregate purchase price for these cable systems was approximately billion 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and billion  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities funded our acquisitions of the at t cable systems 
to finance our prior acquisitions and our network upgrade program and to provide liquidity for future capital needs  we completed the undernoted financing arrangements 
on january   our direct and indirect subsidiaries  mediacom llc and mediacom capital corporation  a new york corporation  completed an offering of million of senior notes due january interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on january and july  which commenced on july  approximately million of the net proceeds were used to repay a substantial portion of the indebtedness outstanding under our bank credit facilities and related accrued interest 
the balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 
on june   we completed a public offering of million shares of our class a common stock at per share for total net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions of at t cable systems 
on june   we completed a public offering of million of convertible senior notes due july interest on the convertible senior notes is payable semi annually on january and july of each year  which commenced on january  the convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a price of per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment  as defined in the indenture to the convertible senior notes 
we may redeem the convertible senior notes at of par value from july  through june  and at par value thereafter 
the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the at t cable systems 
on june   our direct and indirect subsidiaries  mediacom broadband llc and mediacom broadband corporation  a delaware corporation  completed an offering of million of senior notes due july interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on january and july of each year  which commenced on january  the net proceeds from this offering were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the at t cable systems 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc have a billion bank credit facility expiring in september  of which million was outstanding as of december  the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc have two bank credit facilities aggregating billion  of which million was outstanding as of december  mediacom llc s bank credit facilities expire in september and december  however  their final maturities are subject to earlier repayment on dates ranging from june to december if mediacom llc does not refinance its million senior notes due april prior to march  we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from april through march  to hedge million of floating rate debt  including million completed subsequent to december  under the terms of all of our interest rate exchange agreements  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the interest rate exchange agreements 
however  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
as of the date of this report  about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
as of december   our total debt was billion and we had unused credit commitments of about million under all of our bank credit facilities and our annualized cost of debt capital was approximately 
as of january   after giving effect to scheduled step downs in the maximum leverage covenants in our bank credit facilities  approximately million could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes under the most restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
during october  we purchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million at share prices ranging from to per share 
these purchases were completed under the million class a stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in may as of the filing date of this report  approximately million of the original million authorization remains available under the class a stock repurchase program 
although we have not generated earnings sufficient to cover fixed charges  we have generated cash and obtained financing sufficient to meet our short term requirements  including our debt service  working capital  capital expenditure and acquisition requirements 
we expect that we will continue to be able to generate funds and obtain financing sufficient to service our long term business plan  service our debt obligations and complete any future acquisitions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter 
the amounts represent the maximum future contractual obligations  some of which may be settled by delivering equity securities 
long term operating debt a leases total dollars in thousands thereafter    total cash obligations    a includes million of convertible senior notes due critical accounting policies the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent the most significant and subjective estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed description of our significant accounting policies  please see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial reporting by cable television companies  we capitalize a portion of direct and indirect costs related to the construction  replacement and installation of property  plant and equipment  including certain costs related to new video and new high speed internet subscriber installations 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the related assets 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and provides guidance on classification and accounting for such assets when held for sale or abandonment 
based on our review  there has been no impairment of long lived assets under sfas goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require such assets to be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have determined that our cable franchise costs are indefinite lived assets 
upon adoption  we performed initial impairment tests and determined that there was no impairment 
we conducted our annual impairment tests as of september   utilizing discounted cash flow analysis  and they did not result in any impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
the impact of adopting sfas was to reduce amortization expense by million for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which i amends sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  ii amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation  and iii amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
items ii and iii of the new requirements in sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the requirements of item ii in note of our consolidated financial statements and will include the requirements of item iii beginning in our first interim period after december  inflation and changing prices our systems costs and expenses are subject to inflation and price fluctuations 
such changes in costs and expenses can generally be passed through to subscribers 
programming costs have historically increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to do so 
we believe that under the federal communications commission s existing cable rate regulations we may increase rates for cable television services to more than cover any increases in programming and copyright costs 
however  competitive conditions and other factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to increase our rates 
risk factors we have a history of net losses and may not be profitable in the future 
we have had a history of net losses and expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future  which could cause the prices at which our stock and other securities trade to decline and adversely affect our ability to finance our business in the future 
we reported net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the principal reasons for our prior and anticipated net losses include the depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our acquisitions  the capital expenditures related to expanding and upgrading our cable systems and interest costs on borrowed money 
we are a holding company with no operations and we depend on our operating subsidiaries for cash to fund our obligations 
as a holding company  we do not have any operations or hold any assets other than our investments in and our advances to our operating subsidiaries 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
the only source of cash we have to pay interest on  and repay the principal of  our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
our subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us 
our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions  including the agreements governing our subsidiary credit facilities and other indebtedness 
those agreements permit our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances  but only so long as there is no default under any of such agreements 
we have grown rapidly and have a limited history of operating all of our current cable systems  which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our performance 
we began operations in and have grown rapidly since then  principally through acquisitions 
in late  we completed acquisitions that doubled the number of subscribers served by our cable systems 
in june and july  we made other acquisitions that again doubled our subscribers 
as a result  you have limited information upon which to evaluate our performance in managing all of our current systems  and our historical financial information may not be indicative of the future results we can achieve with our cable systems 
we have substantial existing debt and may incur substantial additional debt  which could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and require our operating subsidiaries to apply a substantial portion of their cash flow to debt service 
our total debt as of december  was approximately billion 
our interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows to permit us  or our subsidiaries  to repay indebtedness or that refinancing of that indebtedness will be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
this high level of debt and our debt service obligations could have material consequences  including that 
our ability to access new sources of financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  
we may need to use a large portion of our revenues to pay interest on borrowings under our subsidiary credit facilities and our senior notes  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  
some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates  
we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  
we may be less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new products and services  
we may be at a disadvantage when compared to those of our competitors that have less debt  and 
we may not be able to implement our strategy 
we anticipate incurring additional debt to fund the expansion  maintenance and upgrade of our cable systems 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
a default under our indentures or our subsidiary credit facilities could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and other material adverse effects 
the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness contain numerous financial and operating covenants 
the breach of any of these covenants could cause a default  which could result in the indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we would be unable to adequately finance our operations 
in addition  a default could result in a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness subject to cross default provisions 
if this occurs  we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
even if new financing is available  it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
the membership interests of our operating subsidiaries are pledged as security under the respective subsidiary credit facilities 
a default under one of our subsidiary credit facilities could result in a foreclosure by the lenders on the membership interests pledged under that facility 
because we are dependent upon our operating subsidiaries for all of our revenues  a foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the terms of our indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility 
several of the covenants contained in the agreements and instruments governing our own and our subsidiaries indebtedness could materially limit our financial and operating flexibility by restricting  among other things  our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to 
incur additional indebtedness  
create liens and other encumbrances  
pay dividends and make other payments  investments  loans and guarantees  
enter into transactions with related parties  
sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with another entity  
repurchase or redeem capital stock  other equity interests or debt  
pledge assets  and 
issue capital stock or other equity interests 
complying with these covenants could cause us to take actions that we otherwise would not take or cause us not to take actions that we otherwise would take 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to continue the development of our business 
our business has required substantial capital for the upgrade  expansion and maintenance of our cable systems and the launch and expansion of new or additional services 
while we have substantially completed our planned system upgrades  if there is accelerated growth in our digital cable and data customers  or we decide to introduce new advanced services  or the cost to provide these services increases  we may need to make unplanned additional capital expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain the funds necessary to finance our capital improvement program or any additional capital requirements through internally generated funds  additional borrowings or other sources 
if we are unable to obtain these funds  we would not be able to implement our business strategy and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological change  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the cable business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments 
we also cannot assure you that we will successfully anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring new technology 
this type of rapid technological change could adversely affect our plans to upgrade or expand our systems and respond to competitive pressures 
our inability to upgrade  maintain and expand our systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner  or to anticipate the demands of the market place  could adversely affect our ability to compete 
consequently  our business and results of operations could suffer materially 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we expect that a substantial portion of our future growth in revenues will come from the expansion of relatively new services  such as high speed internet access service  digital cable services and video on demand  and acquisitions of additional cable systems 
we may not be able to successfully expand these services  and it is possible that they will not generate significant revenue growth 
as of the filing date of this report  there were no material pending acquisitions 
we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets or obtaining the financing necessary to complete future acquisitions 
among other things  in recent years  the cable television industry has undergone dramatic consolidation  which has reduced the number of future acquisition prospects and may increase the purchase price for any acquisitions we pursue 
our programming costs are increasing  and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected if we cannot pass through a sufficient part of the additional costs to subscribers 
our programming costs have been  and are expected to continue to be  one of our largest single expense items 
in recent years  the cable and satellite video industries have experienced a rapid increase in the cost of programming  particularly sports programming 
this increase in programming costs is expected to continue  and we may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to our customers 
in addition  as we add programming to our basic and expanded basic programming tiers  we may not be able pass all of our costs of the additional programming on to our customers without the potential loss of basic subscribers 
to the extent that we are unable to pass increased or additional programming costs through to subscribers  our business and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we also expect to be subject to increasing financial and other demands by broadcasters to obtain the required consents for the transmission of broadcast programming to our subscribers 
we cannot predict the impact of these negotiations on our business and results of operations or the effect on our subscribers should we be required to suspend the carriage of this programming 
failure to negotiate or renew programming contracts could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
following our acquisitions of the at t cable systems  substantially all of the programming services carried on those cable systems were without written contracts with the respective program suppliers 
we have completed agreements for several of those programming services and are continuing to negotiate terms for the remainder of the services 
from time to time  the contracts covering the programming services carried on our cable systems expire  and we generally provide such services to our customers without written contracts with the respective program suppliers as we negotiate contract renewals 
while we could obtain access to most of these programming services through a national programming purchasing cooperative or by relying on certain protective provisions of the communications act  we are unable to guarantee that we will be able to provide without interruption any programming service that is not covered by a written contract 
prolonged loss of access to certain of these programming services could result in our customers switching to our competitors or have other material adverse effects on our business and results of operations 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the highly competitive media and telecommunications industries 
the communications industry in which we operate is highly competitive and is often subject to rapid and significant changes and developments in the marketplace and in the regulatory and legislative environment 
in some instances  we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens  easier access to financing  greater resources and operating capabilities  greater brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities 
our traditional cable television business faces direct competition from other cable companies  municipal owned utilities  telephone companies  and  most significantly  from direct broadcast satellite operators 
our high speed internet access service is subject to competition from telephone companies using digital subscriber line technology  direct broadcast satellite operators and other internet service providers 
we also face competition from over the air television and radio broadcasters and from other communications and entertainment media such as movie theaters  live entertainment and sports events  newspapers and home video products 
we anticipate that future advances in communications technology could lead to the introduction of new competitors  products and services that may compete with our businesses 
we cannot assure you that upgrading our cable systems will allow us to compete effectively 
additionally  if we expand and introduce new and enhanced telecommunications services  we will be subject to competition from new and established telecommunications providers 
we cannot predict the extent to which competition may affect our business and results of operations in the future 
continued growth of direct broadcast satellite operators could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
direct broadcast satellite operators have grown at a rate far exceeding the cable television industry growth rate and have emerged as a significant competitor to cable operators 
direct broadcast satellite service consists of television programming transmitted via high powered satellites to individual homes  each served by a small satellite dish 
legislation permitting direct broadcast satellite operators to transmit local broadcast signals was enacted on november  this eliminated a significant competitive advantage that cable system operators had over direct broadcast satellite operators 
direct broadcast satellite operators deliver local broadcast signals in many markets that we serve 
these companies and others are also developing ways to bring advanced communications services to their customers 
they are currently offering satellite delivered high speed internet access services 
we may not be able to obtain critical items at a reasonable cost or when required  which could adversely affect business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on third party suppliers for equipment  software  services and other items that are critical for the operation of our cable systems and the provision of advanced services  including analog and digital set top converter boxes  servers and routers  fiber optic cable  telephone circuits  software  the backbone telecommunications network for our internet access service and construction services for expansion and upgrades of our cable systems 
these items are available from a limited number of suppliers 
demand for these items has increased with the general growth in demand for internet and telecommunications services 
we typically do not carry significant inventories of equipment 
moreover  if there are no suppliers that are able to provide set top converter boxes that comply with evolving internet and telecommunications standards or that are compatible with other equipment and software that we use  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain critical equipment  software  services or other items on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost  our ability to offer our products and services and roll out advanced services may be impaired  and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success is substantially dependent upon the retention and continued performance of our key personnel  including rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer 
we have not entered into an employment agreement with mr 
commisso 
if mr 
commisso or any of our other key personnel cease to be employed by us for any reason  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance on mr 
commisso or other key personnel 
in addition  our subsidiary credit facilities provide that a default will result if any person or group  other than mr 
commisso and certain of his affiliates  becomes the beneficial owner of an amount of aggregate voting power of our common stock on a fully diluted basis that equals or exceeds the greater of i and ii the amount of aggregate voting power of our common stock on a fully diluted basis owned by mr 
commisso and such affiliates at the time 
our chairman and chief executive officer has the ability to control all major corporate decisions  which could inhibit or prevent a change of control or change in management 
a sale of his stock could result in a change of control that would have unpredictable effects 
rocco b 
commisso  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owned our common stock representing approximately of the combined voting power as of december  as a result  mr 
commisso will generally have the ability to control the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of our entire board of directors  the approval of any merger or consolidation and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
mr 
commisso s voting power may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire mediacom because any such acquisition would require his consent 
we cannot assure you that mr 
commisso will maintain all or any portion of his ownership or that he would continue as an officer or director if he sold a significant part of his stock 
the disposition by mr 
commisso of a sufficient number of shares could result in a change in control of our company  and we cannot assure you that a change of control would not adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as noted above  it could also result in a default under our subsidiary credit agreements 
our cable television business is subject to extensive governmental regulation 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels  and  in some instances  at the state level  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative and administrative proposals 
we expect that court actions and regulatory proceedings will continue to refine our rights and obligations under applicable federal  state and local laws 
the results of these judicial and administrative proceedings and legislative activities may materially affect our business operations 
local authorities grant us non exclusive franchises that permit us to operate our cable systems 
we will have to renew or renegotiate these franchises from time to time 
local franchising authorities may demand concessions  or other commitments  as a condition to renewal  which concessions or other commitments could be costly to obtain 
the communications act contains renewal procedures and criteria designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials fo renewal  and although such act requires the local franchising authorities to take into account the costs of meeting such concessions or commitments  there is no assurance that we will not be required to meet their demands in order to obtain renewals 
we cannot predict whether any of the markets in which we operate will expand the regulation of our cable systems in the future or the impact that any such expanded regulation may have upon our business 
similarly  due to the increasing popularity and use of commercial online services and the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to commercial online services and the internet  including laws covering such issues as privacy  access to some types of content by minors  pricing  bulk e mail or spam  encryption standards  consumer protection  electronic commerce  taxation of e commerce  copyright infringement and other intellectual property matters 
the adoption of such laws or regulations in the future may decrease the growth of such services and the internet  which could in turn decrease the demand for our cable modem service  increase our costs of providing such service or have other adverse effects on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our franchises are non exclusive and local franchising authorities may grant competing franchises in our markets 
our cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local franchising authorities 
as a result  competing operators of cable systems and other potential competitors  such as municipal utility providers  may be granted franchises and may build cable systems in markets where we hold franchises 
any such competition could adversely affect our business 
the existence of multiple cable systems in the same geographic area is generally referred to as an overbuild 
as of the filing date of this report  approximately of the homes passed by our cable systems were overbuilt by other cable operators 
we cannot assure you that competition will not develop in other markets that we now serve or that we will serve after any future acquisitions 
pending fcc and court proceedings could adversely affect our internet access service 
the legal and regulatory status of providing high speed internet access service by cable television companies is uncertain 
the adoption of new rules by the fcc or rulings in court proceedings could place additional costs and regulatory burdens on us  reduce our anticipated revenues or increase our anticipated costs for this service  complicate the franchise renewal process  result in greater competition or otherwise adversely affect our business 
although the fcc has issued a declaratory ruling that cable modem service  as it is currently offered  is properly classified as an interstate information service that is not subject to common carrier regulation  the fcc is still considering whether to require cable companies to provide capacity on their systems to other entities to deliver high speed internet directly to customers  also known as open access  whether certain other regulatory requirements do or should apply to cable modem service  and whether and to what extent this service may be subject to local franchise authorities regulatory requirements or franchise fees 
there can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not impose open access or similar requirements on us as part of an industry wide requirement 
such requirements could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to legal liability because of the acts of our internet service customers or because of our own negligence 
our cable modem service enables individuals to access the internet and to exchange information  generate content  conduct business and engage in various online activities on an international basis 
the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the united states and abroad 
potentially  third parties could seek to hold us liable for the actions and omissions of our cable modem service customers  such as defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that our customers use our service to post  download or distribute 
we also could be subject to similar claims based on the content of other websites to which we provide links or third party products  services or content that we may offer through our internet service 
due to the global nature of the web  it is possible that the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate its transmissions or prosecute us for violations of their laws 
it is also possible that  if any information provided directly by us will contain errors or otherwise be negligently provided to users  resulting in third parties making claims against us 
for example  we offer web based email services  which expose us to potential risks  such as liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  or interruptions or delays in email service 
to date  no one has filed a claim of any of these kinds against us  but someone may file a claim of that type in the future in either domestic or international jurisdictions  and may be successful in imposing liability on us 
our defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant distraction of our management and other resources 
if we are held or threatened with significant liability  we may decide to take actions to reduce our exposure to this type of liability 
this may require us to spend significant amounts of money for new equipment and may also require us to discontinue offering some features or our cable modem service 
since we launched our proprietary mediacom online sm internet service in february  we from time to time receive notices of claimed infringements by our cable modem service users 
the owners of copyrights and trademarks have been increasing active in seeking to prevent use of the internet to violate their rights 
in many cases  their claims of infringement are based on the acts of customers of an internet service provider for example  a customer s use of an internet service or the resources it provides to post  download or disseminate copyrighted music or other content without the consent of the copyright owner or to seek to profit from the use of the goodwill associated with another person s trademark 
in some cases  copyright and trademark owners have sought to recover damages from the internet service provider  as well as or instead of the customer 
the law relating to the potential liability of internet service providers in these circumstances is unsettled 
in  congress adopted the digital millennium copyright act  which is intended to grant isps protection against certain claims of copyright infringement resulting from the actions of customers  provided that the isp complies with certain requirements 
so far  congress has not adopted similar protections for trademark infringement claims 
if we offer telecommunications services  we may become subject to additional regulatory burdens 
if we provide telecommunications services over our communications facilities  we may be required to obtain additional federal  state and local permits or other governmental authorizations to offer these services 
this process  together with accompanying regulation of these services  would place additional costs and regulatory burdens on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we use interest rate exchange agreements in order to fix the interest rate on our floating rate debt 
as of december   we had interest rate exchange agreements with various banks pursuant to which the interest rate on million is fixed at a weighted average rate of approximately  plus the average applicable margin over the eurodollar rate option under our bank credit agreements 
under the terms of the interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from through  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties 
however  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
at december   we would have paid approximately million if we terminated these agreements  inclusive of accrued interest 
the table below provides information on our long term debt
