overview we are a leading genetics company organized into two business units or segments sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceuticals 
the two business units combine to capitalize on our high performance dna analysis platform  snp assay portfolio  disease gene discovery programs and extensive dna sample repository 
sequenom genetic systems 
this business unit includes the sales and support of our massarray hardware  consumables and software product offerings  research and development toward expanding applications of the massarray platform  and the provision of genetic services 
our core technology components include the massarray system for high performance dna analysis and a broad portfolio of snp assays 
we commenced sales of our massarray system in january through december   we have placed a total of systems with leading companies and institutions 
we have sold our products to genetics  pharmacogenetics  diagnostic and agricultural biotechnology companies  as well as leading research institutions  in north america  europe and asia 
through december  our product revenues consisted of revenues from the placement of massarray systems  the sales of massarray consumables used with the massarray systems  sales and licensing of proprietary software  and license fees from end users 
our service revenues consist of genetic validation services  with revenue recognized as phases of projects are completed 
we expect sequenom genetic systems to launch new products periodically 
the impact of these new products and fluctuations in the level of genetic validation services undertaken on revenues  margins  expenses and cash flows is uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item of this form k and in the section entitled risks and uncertainties 
sequenom pharmaceuticals 
this business unit includes operations relating to disease gene discovery  target identification  functional validation and ultimately diagnostic and therapeutic product development 
sequenom pharmaceuticals applies the power of human genetics to systematically identify potential disease related genes that affect significant portions of the overall population 
we believe that our technology should enable us to scan virtually every gene in the human genome for association with a given disease  using large sample populations 
using our technology internally and in partnerships  we are generating a portfolio of candidate disease gene markers associated with significant human health disorders  including cardiovascular disease  cancer  diabetes  and obesity 
by focusing on disease genes with a broad population impact  we expect to play an important role in bringing new therapeutic and diagnostic products to market while maximizing the return on their development 
in  we completed eight high resolution genetic scans of the human genome 
the first scan used our healthy population dna bank to identify genes with a general impact on human health 
approximately  validated snp assays were measured across  individuals  with several high confidence targets identified 

table of contents similarly  we completed full genome scans in melanoma  breast cancer  hdl cholesterol  osteoarthritis  schizophrenia  lung cancer and type ii diabetes populations  typically using approximately  snp markers across  individuals 
these scans are yielding encouraging portfolios of potential disease related genes 
we intend to investigate the genes discovered further in an effort to ultimately produce therapeutic and diagnostic products 
revenues may fluctuate significantly as the revenues will initially be based upon licensing of genes and related information and the timing of milestone payments and licensing  and ultimately on diagnostic and therapeutic product sales which is difficult to predict 
to reach the ultimate goal of diagnostic and therapeutic product sales  significant amounts will need to be invested in research and development efforts over several years 
the timing and impact of revenues and expenses is uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item of this form k and in the section entitled risks and uncertainties 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we expand development and commercialization of new products and information based intellectual property 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and condition are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  revenues are recognized  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of the massarray system and consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized over the duration of the software license or upon transfer of title to the customer 
we recognize revenue allocated to maintenance fees for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from snp validation services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts are not determinable  we have estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
accrued acquisition and integration related costs totaled approximately million at december  and represented the amount we expect to incur related to facility exit costs 
we expect that it may take us from six months to a year or possibly longer to sublease the identified surplus space 
materially different results would be likely if it takes longer than expected to sublease or terminate current lease agreements or if financial terms of subleases or termination of agreements are different than estimated 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of its long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
a total impairment charge of million was recognized during the year ended december  intangible assets  primarily resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics  totaled million at december  valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies in the multiple tax jurisdictions where we operate  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of segments of a business and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the statement creates one accounting model based on the framework established in sfas no 
to be applied to all long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
became effective for us on january  application of the principles of sfas no 
resulted in a charge of million in the year ended december   for various tangible and intangible assets where the carrying value exceeded the expected future revenue from those assets 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
adoption is required at the beginning of fiscal year sfas no 
will impact the timing of exit or disposal activities reported by us after adoption

management s discussion and analysis compares the total revenues  costs and expenses for the company in the year ended december  to the same periods in and also  the company does not currently segregate assets by segment as a significant portion of the company s total assets are assets commonly used by both segments and cash and cash equivalents which the company does not assign to its two operating segments 
the company is evaluating the feasibility and usefulness of assigning its other assets to sequenom genetic systems and sequenom pharmaceutical segments and may report assets by segment in the future 
beginning in the quarter ended march   the management discussion and analysis will compare revenues and costs and expenses for both the genetic systems and pharmaceuticals business units 
revenues total revenues increased to million in  from million in and million in product revenues were million for the year ended december   increasing from million in and million for the year ended december  these product revenues were derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables including our proprietary spectrochip bioarray  sales and licensing of our proprietary software and license fees from end users 
the increase in product revenue from to to resulted from an increase in the number of systems sold from to and the related increase in spectrochip bioarrays and proprietary software revenue 
total systems at customer sites increased from at december  to at december  and at december  service revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for we derived these revenues from the completion of significant phases in genetic validation projects 
the commodity service revenue marketplace is competitive and not a strategic focus of our 
table of contents company 
research revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that future revenues will be affected by  among other things  customer budgets  new product and application introductions  competitive conditions and government research funding 
cost of product and service revenue total cost of product and service revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in and in the increase in gross margin resulted primarily from increased volumes and margins from massarray consumables compared to the same periods in and we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the mix of products and services sold  competitive conditions  sales volumes  and royalty payments on licensed technologies 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  materials costs and costs related to our disease gene discovery programs  improvements to our existing products and validation of products under development 
the million increase from to resulted primarily from an increase in personnel to support our expanded research and development activities in the disease gene discovery programs  our acquisition of gemini genomics in the third quarter of  adding approximately million of research and development costs during  as well as our acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  adding approximately million after the acquisition on august  the million increase from to resulted from an increase in the number of personnel to support our increased research and development programs  as well as the acquisition of gemini genomics in the third quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing  customer support  business development  legal  finance and human resource personnel  and their related expenses 
the million increase from to resulted primarily from additional business development and customer support activities and expenses associated with filing patent applications on our inventions  a million increase in expenses over to support gemini genomics activities following our acquisition in september  and a million increase to support axiom biotechnologies activities following our acquisition in the million increase from to resulted primarily from additional sales  marketing and customer support activities  and expenses associated with filing patent applications on our inventions 
integration costs the million integration charge in relates to our decision to close our uppsala  sweden facility and consisted primarily of the book value of the assets at time of closure 
we do not anticipate any additional charges related to the closure of this facility 

table of contents in process research and development in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies in  we recorded a non recurring  non cash in process research and development charge of million 
in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics in  we recorded a non recurring  non cash in process research and development charge of million 
both amounts represents the value of the research and development projects acquired from axiom biotechnologies and gemini genomics that were not technologically feasible or did not have alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights 
in connection with the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including patent rights  human cell banks  and assay technology 
these intangible assets will be amortized over three to five years 
the amortization of million represents the amortization of the gemini genomics intangible assets throughout the year and the amortization of the axiom biotechnologies intangible assets from the date of acquisition 
the amortization of approximately million represents the amortization of the gemini genomics intangible assets from the date of acquisition in september through the end of impairment of assets and goodwill following the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we contracted with an independent third party to perform the annual test for impairment of goodwill at october  as a result of this test  we recognized a non cash charge of million to write off all the remaining goodwill in the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment arising from the acquisitions of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies 
the impairment primarily reflects a decline in long term market expectations for genomics companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we examine our tangible and intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset might not be recoverable 
as a result of this examination  we determined that long lived assets with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
fair value was based on discounted expected future cash flows to be generated by these assets 
these assets included licensed intellectual property  prepayments  software acquired as part of the gemini genomics acquisition  and fixed assets 
an impairment charge of million was accordingly recorded for these assets  million relating to sequenom pharmaceuticals and the remaining million relating to sequenom genetic systems 
cumulative effect of accounting change effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually thereafter 
upon adoption of sfas no 
we recognized a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill 
the charge is non operational in nature and is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value of the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology  and the charge related entirely to the sequenom pharmaceuticals segment and the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of gemini genomics 
we performed our annual impairment review on october  and recognized a non cash charge of million to write off the 
table of contents remaining goodwill from the acquisitions of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies 
we plan to continue to perform our reviews on an annual basis 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
no amortization on the goodwill arising as a result of our acquisition of gemini genomics in september was recognized during in accordance with the transition arrangements in sfas no 
quarterly results as reported are therefore comparable 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation deferred stock compensation represents the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of options at the date of grant 
during the year ended december   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation totaling approximately million  compared to million in and million in these amounts all relate to stock options granted prior to our initial public offering in january and are being amortized over the vesting periods of the individual stock options in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
we expect the remaining deferred stock based compensation of  to be completely amortized during interest income interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease from to and from to resulted from lower interest rates and lower average balances of interest bearing investments 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  and approximately million in interest expense in and resulted primarily from interest payments under our capital lease obligations and long term debt 
the interest expense amount in of million was comprised of approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded upon conversion of debt of million million german deutsche marks exchanged at a rate of deutsche marks per us dollar into common stock and approximately million of interest related to capital lease obligations  offset in part by approximately million of a non cash gain recorded upon issuance of common stock to extinguish long term interest payable 
income taxes as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
at december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million  reflecting uncertainties associated with future profitability 
as of december   we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the difference between the federal and state tax loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research and development expenses for state tax purposes and the limitation on the california loss carryforwards 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
approximately million of the state tax loss carryforwards expired in and the state tax loss carry forwards will continue to expire in unless previously utilized 
the company also has german and united kingdom uk net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be carried forward indefinitely 
approximately million of the uk net operating loss carry forwards was acquired with the purchase of gemini genomics and is fully reserved by the valuation allowance 
to the extent these uk net operating loss carry forwards are utilized  such benefit will be recorded as a purchase accounting adjustment 
the deferred tax asset includes a future tax benefit of approximately million related to stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated to additional paid in capital 

table of contents the company also has federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in unless previously utilized 
pursuant to internal revenue code sections and  use of the company s federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited due to a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year period 
use of the company s uk net operating loss carry forwards may be limited upon the occurrence of certain events such as the discontinuation or change in the nature or conduct of the business 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed our initial public offering raising net proceeds of approximately million 
prior to our ipo  we funded our operations with million of private equity financings  million in loans and convertible loans and million from equipment financing arrangements 
as of december  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash totaled million  compared to million at december  and million at december  our cash reserves are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million in a net loss of million in was partially offset by non cash charges  including million resulting from the cumulative effect of accounting change upon adoption of sfas  million related to goodwill written off as a result of a review required by sfas  million for depreciation and amortization expense  million related to tangible and intangible asset write downs under sfas  million of in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of axiom biotechnologies  million of non cash accrued integration expenses  and other non cash items totaling million 
cash used in investing activities was million

cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in financing activities in included million  net of repayments  of proceeds from long term debt  repayments of capital leases of million  and million of proceeds from employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
the following table summarized our contractual obligations as of december  in millions contractual obligations total less than year years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations future operating lease commitments for leases have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals aggregating million 

table of contents other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements through at least the next months 
however  the actual amount of funds that we will need during or after the next months will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include the level of our success in selling our massarray systems  consumables  software  assays and services  the level of our sales and marketing expenses  the extent to which we enter into collaborations or joint ventures  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services  our success in developing diagnostic and therapeutic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the level of our acquisition and integration expenses  including tax and other liabilities from the gemini genomics  axiom biotechnologies or other acquisitions  our ability to exit existing excess facilities on terms that are financially acceptable  the level of our expenses associated with litigation or termination of agreements  the costs and timing of obtaining new patent rights  the costs and expenses associated with defending or asserting any intellectual property claims or litigation  the extent to which we acquire technologies or companies  and regulatory changes and competition and technological developments in the market 
we have a million bank line of credit  of which million is available for borrowing 
we have an asset backed loan line of million  of which million is available for borrowing 
we have no commitments for any additional financings 
when we require additional funds  general market conditions or the then current market price of our common stock may not support capital raising transactions such as an additional public or private offering of our common stock 
if additional funds are required and we are unable to obtain them on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
if we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock  the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration 
table of contents of all of our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound gbp and the euro eur  the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary or affiliate having the asset or liability 
as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities functional currency of operations euro us dollars gbp other in millions great british pound euro a movement of in the us dollar to pound exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the year covered 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
