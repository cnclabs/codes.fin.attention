overview we believe that we are a leader in the discovery and validation of high quality novel targets for several major human diseases  and a leader in the discovery of potential new drug therapies  specifically for cancer and other proliferative diseases 
our primary mission is to develop proprietary human therapeutics by leveraging our integrated discovery platform to increase the speed  efficiency and quality of pharmaceutical product discovery and development 
through our expertise in comparative genomics and model system genetics  we are able to find new drug targets that we believe would be difficult or impossible to uncover using other experimental approaches 
our research is designed to identify novel genes and proteins expressed by those genes that  when changed  either decrease or increase the activity in a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically relevant manner 
these genes and proteins represent either potential product targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or progression 
our most advanced proprietary pharmaceutical program focuses on drug discovery and development of small molecules in cancer 
specifically  the remarkable evolutionary conservation of the biochemical pathways strongly supports the use of simple model systems  such as fruit flies  nematode worms  zebrafish and mice  to identify key components of critical cancer pathways that can then be targeted for drug discovery 
we expect to develop new cancer drugs by exploiting the underlying genetic liabilities of tumor cells to provide specificity in targeting these cells for destruction  while leaving normal cells unharmed 
we have discovered and are further developing a number of small molecule drug targets in addition to monoclonal antibody drug targets 
molecules directed against these targets may selectively kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed  and may provide alternatives or supplements to current cancer therapies 
we believe that our proprietary technologies are also valuable to other industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of dna or proteins  including the agrochemical  agricultural and diagnostic industries 
many of these industries have shorter product development cycles and lower risk than the pharmaceutical industry  while at the same time generating significant sales with attractive profit margins 
by partnering with companies in multiple industries  we believe that we are able to diversify our business risk  while at the same time maximizing our future revenue stream opportunities 
our strategy is to establish collaborations with major pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies based on the strength of our technologies and biological expertise as well as to support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees and research funding  together with the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development 
in addition  many of our collaborations have been structured strategically to provide us access to technology to advance our internal programs  saving both time and money  while at the same time retaining rights to use the same information in different industries 
our collaborations with leading companies in the agrochemical industries allow us to continue to expand our internal development capabilities while providing our partners with novel targets and assays 
since we believe that agrochemical products have reduced development time and lower risk  we expect to be able to maximize our potential future revenue stream through partnering in multiple industries 
we have active commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agrochemical companies bayer cropscience lp formerly aventis usa lp  bayer corporation  bristol myers squibb company two collaborations  cytokinetics  inc  dow agrosciences llc  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  merck co  inc two collaborations  protein design labs  inc  renessen llc  scios inc  schering plough research institute  inc 
and smithklinebeecham corporation 
in addition to our commercial collaborations  we have relationships with other biotechnology companies  academic institutions and universities that provide us access to specific technology or intellectual property for the enhancement of our business 
these include collaborations with leading biotechnology product developers and solutions providers  among them affymetrix  genemachines  avi biopharma  inc  silicon genetics  galapagos nv  genomics collaborative inc  accelrys  inc  akceli  inc  ardais corp  cogen biocognetics  inc  impath predictive oncology  inc  and virtual arrays  inc 
we have a history of operating losses resulting principally from costs associated with research and development activities  investment in core technologies and general and administrative functions 
as a result of planned expenditures for future research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in pre clinical and clinical studies  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
acquisition of genomica corporation on december   we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of genomica corporation genomica  a bio informatics software company 
the acquisition of genomica was completed in january upon the effectiveness of the merger  genomica became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of genomica common stock 
a total of approximately million shares of our common stock were issued for all of the outstanding shares of genomica common stock 
the purchase price for genomica  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded net tangible assets of million including cash and investments of million  developed technology of  which will be amortized over two years  and goodwill of million 
at the same time  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was expensed in to operations 
the impairment was calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  by estimating the present value of future cash flows for the ongoing genomica licensing business using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the impaired goodwill represented excess purchase price  which we viewed as economically equivalent to financing costs for the acquired cash and investments 
in december  in connection with the acquisition of genomica  exelixis adopted an exit plan for genomica 
under this exit plan  we terminated genomica s entire workforce and abandoned its leased facilities in boulder  colorado and sacramento  california 
the estimated costs of the exit plan amounted to million and were included as part of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition 
in april  we transferred the genomica software business to visualize  inc visualize for future consideration of up to million in license fees and royalty payments 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the genomica software  including the sole right to further develop and license the software to other third parties 
royalties that exelixis receives  if any  will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain from discontinued operations 
in addition  visualize assumed our lease obligation for genomica s abandoned facility in sacramento  california 
exelixis retains an internal use license for the software 
as a result of this transaction  we reported the operating results of genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of genomica as discontinued operations 
for the period beginning january  to its disposal in april  genomica s operating results consisted of revenues of approximately  and an operating loss of approximately  the loss on the sale of genomica includes the write off of goodwill of approximately  partially offset by an adjustment to the estimated lease obligation by approximately  related to the sacramento facility assumed by visualize 
as of december   the remaining actions to be taken under the exit plan consisted primarily of residual payments related to the lease obligation for the facility in boulder  colorado  which are expected to continue until the termination of the lease in  unless the facility is subleased earlier 
beginning in the first quarter of  we have applied the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
acquisition of artemis pharmaceuticals in may  we acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock of artemis pharmaceuticals gmbh  a privately held genetics and functional genomics company organized under the laws of germany 
the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of shares of our common stock for deutschmark of nominal value of artemis capital stock  using an exchange ratio of to one 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in exchange for of the outstanding capital stock of artemis held by artemis stockholders 
in addition  we received a call option the call option from  and issued a put option the put option to  certain stockholders of artemis the option holders for the issuance of approximately  additional shares of our common stock in exchange for the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of artemis held by the option holders 
we could have exercised the call option at any time from may  through january   and the option holders could have exercised their rights under the put option at any time from april  through may  we exercised the call option for  shares and  shares in december and january  respectively  which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately million and million  respectively  related to the additional purchase price 
in addition  we issued fully vested rights to purchase approximately  additional shares of our common stock to artemis employees in exchange for such employees vested options formerly representing the right to purchase shares of artemis capital stock pursuant to the artemis employee phantom stock option program 
artemis provides us with technologies related to the following two species zebrafish and mice 
these technologies are used in our research and development efforts 
the purchase price for artemis  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based upon an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible assets of million and intangible assets including goodwill of million  the majority of which was being amortized over years until december  under sfas  we have applied the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas since the third quarter of  we have undertaken a strategic initiative with respect to our mouse business at artemis  and intend to split off the entity  including all personnel  and create a separate independent company 
this activity is expected to occur in acquisition of exelixis plant sciences formerly agritope in december  we completed our acquisition of agritope  inc as a result of the acquisition  agritope became our wholly owned subsidiary  and we subsequently changed its name to exelixis plant sciences  inc the transaction  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  was effected through the exchange of of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of agritope capital stock 
approximately million shares of our common stock were issued in connection with the transaction 
in addition  unexpired and unexercised options and warrants to purchase shares of agritope capital stock were assumed by us pursuant to the transaction and converted into fully vested options and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price for agritope  which for financial accounting purposes was valued at million  was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by an independent valuation 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  net tangible liabilities of million and intangible assets including goodwill of million  the majority of which was being amortized over years until december  under sfas  we have applied the new rules of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets beginning in the first quarter of accordingly  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with sfas we acquired vinifera  inc vinifera in connection with the purchase of agritope which was the parent company of vinifera 
vinifera was organized as a majority owned subsidiary and was engaged in the grape vine propagation business 
because this business did not fit our strategic objectives  at the date of the acquisition of agritope  we committed to a plan to sell the vinifera operations 
on march   we reduced our ownership interest in vinifera from to by selling million shares of vinifera common stock back to vinifera in consideration for million in interest bearing promissory notes 
as a result of the sale of vinifera common stock back to vinifera  we deconsolidated vinifera  excluded our share of vinifera s operating losses for the first quarter of of  and recorded the following amounts as an adjustment to goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of agritope a write down of the value of acquired developed technology attributable to vinifera of  a gain on sale of vinifera shares of  and a promissory note reserve of  the net adjustment was an increase to goodwill in the amount of  beginning april   we accounted for our remaining investment in vinifera using the cost method 
due to risks associated with collection  as of december   we reserved for of these promissory notes 
due to a significant decline in the operating performance of vinifera  in december  we wrote down our remaining cost basis investment in vinifera to zero 
vinifera ceased operations in critical accounting policies we believe the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from complex research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized at the date the milestone is achieved  and the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by an immaterial amount compared to total revenue recognized 
revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds 
exit costs prior to the completion of the december  acquisition of genomica  we formulated an exit plan for genomica to improve the operating efficiency of the combined company 
this plan called for the reduction of substantially all of genomica s workforce and the abandonment of leased facilities in boulder  colorado and sacramento  california 
these activities were completed during the first half of the actual costs related to the remaining exit activities may differ from the amounts recorded as of december  for example  we have reserved  as of december  for our estimated maximum obligation under genomica s remaining operating lease commitment 
however  these operating lease commitments may be resolved in a more favorable manner  such as the possibility of successfully subleasing the abandoned space 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we will evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
furthermore  our impairment evaluation of goodwill will require management to exercise judgment in the identification of our reporting units 
the impairment test for goodwill will be performed at the reporting unit level  which may be one level below the single operating segment disclosed in our current financial statements  depending upon whether certain criteria are met 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december   and total revenues total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the increase from to resulted primarily from the impact of our corporate collaborations with smithklinebeecham corporation glaxosmithkline or gsk  bristol myers squibb company bms and protein design labs  inc pdl and from compound deliveries under our chemistry collaborations established with cytokinetics  inc  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  scios inc 
and schering plough research institute  inc to jointly design custom high throughput screening compound libraries 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of revenue from pharmacia due to the february conclusion of our collaboration 
the increase from to resulted principally from license and contract revenues earned from the signing of new collaboration agreements with pdl and bms  additional revenues under our existing collaborative agreements with bayer  bms  dow agrosciences llc and bayer cropscience and  to a lesser extent  recognition of the remaining deferred revenue related to the mutually agreed termination of our collaboration with pharmacia  which terminated in february research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facilities costs  supplies  licenses and depreciation of facilities and laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the increase in over resulted primarily from the following costs increased personnel staffing costs in increased by approximately from levels to approximately million 
the increase was to support new collaborative arrangements and our internal proprietary research efforts 
salary  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
we expect these personnel costs to increase further as we continue to build our organization 
increased lab supplies as a result of the increase in personnel  our compound collaborations and the significant expansion of our drug discovery operations  lab supplies expense increased to million during increased licenses and consulting in order to support new collaborative arrangements  manufacture the rebeccamycin analog to ensure adequate clinical supply  complete data analysis for the ongoing nci sponsored phase ii trials  plan for registration trials of the rebeccamycin analog and to advance xl  our lead ind candidate  through preclinical toxicology testing in anticipation of filing an ind  license and consulting expenses increased to million during we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future  as we continue to advance drug discovery and development programs  including manufacturing and clinical development efforts on our maturing pipeline of products 
with respect to the rebeccamycin analogue and our own proprietary compounds  we are currently relying on collaborators and third party contractors to produce materials for clinical trials 
we expect clinical costs will increase in the future as we enter clinical trials for proprietary product candidates and additional trials for our rebeccamycin analogue  if any 
we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals  which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize products 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
our most advanced clinical program is the rebeccamycin analogue xl  an anticancer compound that we in licensed from bms in the rebeccamycin analogue has completed phase i testing 
the phase ii clinical testing program  which is being conducted by the national cancer institute nci  is well advanced 
to date  the most pronounced antitumor activity was observed in upper gastrointestinal tumors most prominently in bile duct tumors  where several partial responses and instances of prolonged disease stabilization occurred 
we believe that the compound deserves further development efforts  as there is currently no approved standard therapy for these rapidly progressing tumors 
we anticipate initiating next development steps  if any  following discussions with the food and drug administration fda 
xl is the first small molecule compound developed from our proprietary drug discovery platform 
we are currently completing regulatory toxicology studies  and if the safety profile continues to look acceptable  we expect to file an ind in the increase in research and development expenses from and was due primarily to increased staffing and other personnel related costs and non cash stock compensation expense as described below 
these expenses were incurred to support new collaborative arrangements and proprietary programs 
increased personnel staffing costs in increased by approximately to approximately million from the increase was to support new collaborative arrangements and our internal proprietary research efforts  including increased expenses related to staff hired with the acquisition of artemis in may and agritope in december salary  bonuses  related fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs are included in personnel costs 
increased lab supplies as a result of the increase in personnel and the significant expansion of our drug discovery operations  lab supplies increased to approximately million during increased licenses and consulting to support new collaborative arrangements and further development of proprietary programs  license and consulting expenses increased to approximately million during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staffing costs to support our research activities  facilities costs and professional expenses  such as legal fees 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the decrease in from was primarily due to a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million as described below  partially offset by costs associated with personnel and facilities to support expansion in our research and development operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased staffing in support of our expanded research and development activities  partially offset by a decrease in non cash stock compensation expense of million as described below 
stock compensation expense deferred stock compensation for options granted to our employees is the difference between the fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to consultants has been determined based upon estimated fair value  using the black scholes option valuation model 
as of december   we have approximately million of remaining deferred stock compensation  related to stock options granted to consultants and employees 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and consultants  we recorded no deferred stock compensation in the years ended december  and and million in this amount was recorded as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized as stock compensation expense over the vesting periods of the options  which is generally four years 
we recognized stock compensation expense of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for these amounts are included within research and development and general and administrative expenses 
the decreases in stock compensation expense in compared to and in compared to primarily result from the accelerated amortization method used for accounting purposes 
during april  we granted approximately  supplemental stock options supplemental options under the equity incentive plan to certain employees excluding officers and directors who had stock options with exercise prices greater than per share under the equity incentive plan 
the number of supplemental options granted was equal to of the corresponding original grant held by each employee 
the supplemental options have an exercise price of  vest monthly over a two year period beginning april   and have a month term 
the vesting on the corresponding original stock options was suspended and will resume in april following the completion of vesting of the supplemental options 
this new grant constitutes a synthetic repricing as defined in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and results in certain options being reported using the variable plan method of accounting for stock compensation expense until those options are exercised  forfeited or expire 
for the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense related to these supplemental options of  of which  was reversed in due to a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
acquired in process research and development the valuation of the purchased in process research and development related to the artemis acquisition of million was determined by management based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for each of the three significant in process projects 
the in process projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate genetic model organisms  zebra fish and mice  to identify and functionally validate novel genes in vivo 
these genes can be used as novel screening targets or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially relevant diseases 
the in process projects have been abandoned or are expected to be completed over approximately the next two years 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired in process project based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of  which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in process projects 
the purchased in process technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility  and it has no alternative future use  and accordingly  it was recorded as a component of operating expenses 
in connection with the agritope purchase in fiscal year  we recorded expense of million relating to acquired in process research and development 
the valuation of the purchased in process research and development was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income approach for each of the ten projects in process 
the in process projects relate primarily to the development of disease and insect resistant fruits and vegetables and have been abandoned or are expected to be completed over approximately the next three and one half years 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired in process project based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology as well as the percent complete of each in process research and development project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of  which is considered commensurate with the overall risk and percent complete of the in process projects 
the purchased technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility  and it has no alternative future use  accordingly  it was recorded as a component of operating expense 
impairment of goodwill in  we acquired million of goodwill in connection with our genomica acquisition 
at the same time  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  which was expensed in to operations 
the impairment was calculated in accordance with sfas  by estimating the present value of future cash flows for the ongoing genomica licensing business using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the impaired goodwill represented excess purchase price  which we viewed as economically equivalent to financing costs for the acquired cash and investments 
we adopted sfas on january  this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
we completed a transitional impairment test during the first quarter of  which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
we adopted an annual goodwill impairment test date as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of accordingly  we completed the annual impairment test as of october   which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangibles result from our acquisitions of genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
amortization of intangibles was  for the year ended december   compared to amortization of goodwill and intangibles of million for and  for the decrease in from was primarily related to our adoption of sfas  whereby goodwill is no longer amortized 
the increase in over was the result of amortization of goodwill and intangibles from the agritope acquisition for months compared to only one month in as well as the amortization of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of artemis 
restructuring charge during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan  which resulted in a reduction in workforce of employees primarily from our us research operations 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of  comprised primarily of involuntary termination benefits 
the restructuring plan was implemented in order to facilitate our evolution into a fully integrated drug discovery company and the reallocation of resources to permit greater focus on building our expanding portfolio of development programs 
other income expense  net other income  net  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for other income expense consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  offset by interest expense incurred on notes payable  bank obligations and capital lease obligations 
the decrease in from was the result of a decrease in interest income due to an overall decline in interest rates coupled with an increase in interest expense related to notes payable and bank obligations 
the decrease in from was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense related to notes payable and capital leases 
discontinued operations in april  we transferred the genomica software business to visualize for future consideration of up to million in license fees and royalty payments 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction  visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the genomica software  including the sole right to further develop and license the software to other third parties 
royalties that we receive  if any  will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain in discontinued operations 
in addition  visualize assumed the lease obligation for genomica s abandoned facility in sacramento  california 
we retained an internal use license for the software 
as a result of this transaction  we reported the operating results of genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of genomica as discontinued operations 
for the period beginning january  and ending with the discontinuation of genomica s operations in april  genomica s operating results consisted of revenues of approximately  and an operating loss of approximately  the loss on the sale of genomica includes the write off of goodwill of approximately  partially offset by a change in estimate for genomica s lease obligation for the sacramento facility assumed by visualize of approximately  minority interest and equity in net loss of affiliated company on march   we reduced our ownership interest in vinifera  inc to 
beginning april   we accounted for our remaining investment in vinifera using the cost method 
due to a significant decline in the operating performance of vinifera  we wrote down our investment in vinifera to zero in december for  minority interest in subsidiary net loss represents the minority shareholders portion of vinifera s operating loss 
net loss reported by us  which is attributable to the minority shareholders  was approximately  in since we owned in excess of of vinifera  we consolidated vinifera s operating results  a portion of which was then allocated to the minority shareholders as minority interest in proportion to their ownership interest  partially offsetting our operating loss 
income taxes we have incurred net losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any us federal or state income taxes 
we have recorded a tax provision of approximately  for the year ended december  related to income earned in our foreign operations 
as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million in each jurisdiction 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions  certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  equipment lease financings and other loan facilities and payments from collaborators 
our initial public offering  completed in the second quarter of  raised million in net cash proceeds 
in addition  we acquired genomica in december  including million in cash and investments 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash 
our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash used in operating activities during each year related primarily to funding net losses  partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue from collaborators  non cash charges related to acquired in process research and development  depreciation and amortization of deferred stock compensation and intangibles 
our investing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for and cash used of million for cash provided in resulted primarily from the maturities and sales of short term investments  offset by purchases of other short term investments 
the cash provided in consisted of cash resulting from the acquisitions of artemis and genomica and proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments  partially offset by purchases of short term investments and property and equipment 
the use of cash for consisted primarily of purchases of short term investments and property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short term investments and proceeds from sale leaseback of equipment 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and our administrative infrastructure  including the purchase of property and equipment to support our expanding operations 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for cash provided from financing activities in resulted primarily from million from a convertible note with gsk  in addition to million from the issuance of common stock to gsk  both in accordance with an executed collaboration agreement 
the cash provided from financing activities in was partially offset by principal payments on capital leases  bank obligations and notes payable 
the cash provided in consisted of million proceeds from the issuance of common stock to bms as part of a collaboration agreement and million proceeds from a convertible note with pdl  partially offset by principal payments on capital leases and notes payable 
cash provided from financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from our initial public offering 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funding to be received from collaborators  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next two years 
changes in our operating plan as well as factors described in our risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k could require us to consume available resources much sooner than we expect 
it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
in july  we filed a registration statement on form s to offer and sell up to million of common stock 
we have no current commitments to offer or sell securities with respect to shares that may be offered or sold pursuant to that filing 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or  even if available  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
commitments we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability or requirements of cash 
we are also not involved with non exchange traded commodity contracts accounted for at fair value 
we have no commercial commitments with related parties  except for employee loans 
we have contractual obligations in the form of operating and capital leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
these are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years minimum purchase obligations   notes payable and bank obligations    licensing agreements      capital lease obligations    convertible promissory note and loan    operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      we had outstanding loans aggregating  and  to certain officers and employees as of december  and  respectively 
the notes are general recourse or collateralized by certain real property assets  bear interest at rates ranging from to and have maturities through the principal plus accrued interest will be forgiven at various rates over three to four years from the employees date of employment with us 
if an employee leaves us  all unpaid and unforgiven principal and interest will be due and payable within days 
as of december   we had outstanding loans aggregating million to our stockholders 
the loans were issued to enable certain employees to purchase stock pursuant to their employee stock options 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature at various times through february recent accounting pronouncements we implemented sfas on january  this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we completed a transitional impairment test during the first quarter of  which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
we adopted an annual goodwill impairment test date as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of following this approach  we completed the annual impairment test as of october   which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill 
we will continue to monitor asset carrying values as of october  assess if there is a potential impairment and complete the measurement of impairment  if required 
we will perform the impairment measurement procedures under sfas no 
if it is determined that a potential impairment of goodwill exists 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas on january  
sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
the primary objectives of sfas were to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in sfas for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   although earlier adoption is permitted 
we adopted sfas in the fourth quarter of  with no significant impact on our financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december   and  we had investments in debt securities of approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
we manage market risk by our diversification requirements  which limit the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december   and  we had long term debt outstanding of approximately million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our long term debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the estimated effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates as of december  and as of december   a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million 
as of december   an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would have a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million 
it is assumed the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the operations of our german subsidiaries 
the revenues and expenses of our german subsidiaries are denominated in euro 
at the end of each reporting period  the revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the average currency rate in effect for the period  and assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period 
fluctuations in exchange rates  therefore  impact our financial condition and results of operations as reported in us dollars 
in february  we commenced using derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated operating results 
as of december   we had outstanding an aggregate notional amount of million of written foreign currency put option contracts and a notional amount of million of purchased foreign currency call option contracts denominated in euro 
both the put and call option contracts have an average exercise price of and expire no later than october  the fair value of these contracts at december  was approximately  which is reflected on the balance sheet as an asset 
our hedging strategy is designed such that any potential losses on these instruments will be materially offset in earnings by a reduction in euro denominated costs for our german operations 
we cannot give any assurance that our hedging strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately
