item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this analysis of the company s financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment were present  the company would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment and intangibles  in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business  which are based on judgment and assumptions 
warranty 
the company s warranty reserve is established based on its best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
the company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on recent actual warranty claims 
also  the company s recall reserve is established  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the cost per unit to remedy the problem and the estimated number of units that will ultimately be brought in for the repair 
while the company s warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty costs that it has in the past 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
revenue recognition 
beginning with the year  motorhome and towables sales are recorded by the company when accepted by the dealer rather than at the time of shipment as in earlier years 
this change in accounting principle was made to implement sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
legal proceedings 
the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings and has accrued its estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with counsel handling the company s defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies

as required by sfas  the company performed interim testing for goodwill impairment and determined it necessary to recognize the complete impairment of its goodwill 
this impairment totaled million in the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the value of the company  as indicated by the recent average stock price  apportioned to the business units and increased by a hypothetical control premium 
as a result of such complete impairment of goodwill  there was no amortization of intangibles in amortization of intangibles was million in as a result of the foregoing  resulted in an operating loss of million  compared to an operating loss of million in as a percentage of net sales  operating loss was in compared with in other income  which includes net interest income  decreased by million to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the company becoming a net cash borrower in from a net cash investor in  partially offset by the realization in of a million gain on the sale of the company s airplane

as a percentage of net sales  net loss was in  compared with a loss in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales in decreased by million to million  or  from million in the decline in sales reflected an industry wide slowdown in in consumer demand for recreational vehicles 
nrv s sales of class a motorhomes decreased units  or  in to  units compared to  units in  while the average sales price increased 
the decline in unit sales during was partially due to nrv s inability to meet demand for its painted diesel coaches due to restraints on paint capacity as well as a product shift to higher price diesel units 
cci s unit sales decreased units  or  in to units compared to units in  while the average price of these units increased 
sales of travel trailers increased units  or  in to  units compared to units in  while the average sales price of these travel trailers decreased 
the increase in unit sales and decrease in average price of travel trailers reflects nrv s offering of additional entry level towable products in cost of goods sold in decreased by million to million  or  from million in resulting primarily from decreased net sales 
gross profit margin was in compared to in the decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to i manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to operating at reduced production levels and nrv s switch to paint on all diesel products  ii high discounts and rebates as manufacturers and dealers continued to adjust inventory levels to lower sales levels  and iii increased warranty expense including expanded warranty reserves and recalls

as a percentage of net sales  net loss was in  compared with net income  which represented of net sales 
liquidity and capital resources during the first half of  the company financed its operations primarily through its existing working capital 
in august  the company entered into an asset based borrowing agreement described below for a small portion of its working capital needs 
on december   the company had working capital of million compared to million at december  this decrease of million was primarily due to a million decrease in inventory  a million decrease in accounts receivable  and a million increase in accrued expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was million  with million of capital expenditures being offset by million in proceeds from the sale of assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  mainly due to a million advance on a new line of credit and million in proceeds from issuance of common stock through the exercise of stock options 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of million resulting in negative cash flows from operating activities of million and a reduction to working capital of million 
the net loss was mainly attributable to i the recognition of the complete impairment of the company s goodwill  ii continued significant discounting to wholesale distributors  iii continued high warranty costs  iv excess manufacturing capacity and related fixed costs caused by continued low volumes and v a workers compensation reserve increase 
as of december   the company had additional short term debt of  and long term debt of  in addition  the company has an asset based revolving credit facility of  with ups capital corporation upsc  of which  is reserved for a letter of credit  required by the state of california  serving as security for nrv s self insured workers compensation program and  reserved for another contingent liability 
the remaining  is available for general corporate and working capital needs and capital expenditures 
on february   the company and upsc entered into a loan modification agreement  increasing the credit facility to  for a day period to support a short term buildup in inventory for the st quarter show season 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate listed in the wall street journal plus percentage points 
the credit facility contains  among other provisions  certain financial covenants  including net worth requirements 
at december    was outstanding under this facility and the company was not in default with any covenants of its loan agreement with upsc 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company has suffered net losses of  and  and recorded net income of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has used cash from operating activities of   and provided cash from operating activities of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company has funded its financial needs primarily through operations and its existing line of credit 
at december   the company had cash and cash investments of  and working capital of  the company remains dependent upon its ability to obtain outside financing either through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or through borrowings until it achieves sustained profitability through a combination of increased sales and improved product margins 
management intends to continue or start a variety of initiatives to improve its working capital position  including i new product and floorplan introductions in the fourth quarter with an additional new product introduction in second quarter  ii certain product re pricing to more competitive levels  iii the continuation of discounts and rebates offered to help move older dealer inventory  freeing financing for new models that should improve retail turns  iv head count rebalancing to sustainable production levels  v an engineering review of material components for the removal of non value added items to reduce both material costs and assembly steps  vi continued focus on improving quality through thorough inspections and timely reporting of failures  vii manufacturing efficiency improvements through longer lead times for production increases allowing better training of new hires to the direct work force  viii non producing asset dispositions such as raw property in florida  ix pursuit of a permanent increase in the line of credit  x a substantial reduction in all categories of inventory and xi filing for a federal income tax refund of approximately million 
the company s success in execution of these initiatives will have a significant impact on the company s liquidity during the company believes the combination of internally generated funds  working capital  and unused borrowing availability will be sufficient to meet the company s planned capital and operational requirements for at least the next months 
should the company require further capital resources during  it would most likely address such requirement through a combination of sales of its products  sales of equity securities  and or additional debt financings 
if circumstances changed  and additional capital was needed  no assurance can be given that the company would be able to obtain such additional capital resources 
if unexpected events occur requiring the company to obtain additional capital and it is unable to do so  it then might attempt to preserve its available resources by deferring the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  deferring the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scaling back its operations 
if the company were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  such inability would have an adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  cash flows and prospects of the company 
the following is a schedule as of december  of the company s known contractual obligations for the periods presented below 
contractual obligations in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases    line of credit ups   letters of credit   repurchase obligations 
  the company has a line of credit that totals million and is set to expire on august  of the million line of credit   is reserved for a letter of credit  required by the state of california  serving as security for nrv s self insured workers compensation program 
as is common in the industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of december  the risk of loss under such agreements is spread over numerous dealers and lenders and is further reduced by the resale value of the motorhomes the company would be required to repurchase 
the company s losses under these agreements have not been material in the past 
effects of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on the company s results of operations for the periods presented 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas  which changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  due to the recent sustained decline in the price of the company s common stock  resulting from the company s third quarter loss  which was unexpected by the market  the company performed interim testing for goodwill impairment and determined it necessary to recognize the complete impairment of its goodwill 
this impairment totaled million for the quarter ended september  the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the value of the company  as indicated by the recent average stock price  apportioned to the business units and increased by a hypothetical control premium 
in october  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which replaces sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas establishes one accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for the recognition  measurement and reporting of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
adoption of sfas in the company s fiscal year did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of certain guarantees  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under the guarantee 
fin also requires significant new disclosures  in both interim and annual financial statements  by a guarantor  about obligations associated with guarantees issued 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for our fiscal year ended december  and the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  at december   the company had no guarantees outstanding except in respect to warranty reserves 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has not adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation  and the adoption of the disclosure requirements of this sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
forward looking statements statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are inherently uncertain 
actual performance and results may differ materially from that projected or suggested herein due to certain risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  factors set forth below 
additional information concerning risks and uncertainties may be identified from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec and the company s public announcements  copies of which are available from the sec or from the company upon request 
factors that may affect future operating results potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s net sales  gross margin and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to factors such as the mix of products sold  the level of discounting employed on the company s products  the ability to utilize or expand manufacturing resources efficiently  material shortages  the introduction and consumer acceptance of new models offered by the company  competition  warranty expense  the addition or loss of dealers  the timing of trade shows and rallies  and factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole  such as cyclicality and seasonality 
in addition  the company s overall gross margin on its products will be impacted by the company s product shifts 
due to the relatively high selling prices of many of the company s motorhome models in particular  its highline class a motor coaches  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles sold in any quarter can have a significant effect on sales and operating results for that quarter 
continuation of losses 
the company has had net losses totaling million and million for and  respectively 
continued losses could reduce the company s liquidity and cause the company to reduce its expenditures on capital improvements  machinery and equipment  and research and development 
this could have a negative effect on the company s ability to maintain production schedules  manufacture products of high quality  and develop and manufacture new products that will achieve market acceptance 
this could in turn  have a negative impact on the company s sales and earnings 
if the company continues to suffer losses  the company could be unable to implement its business and financial strategies or meet its obligations when due 
the company s losses in and were mainly caused by i the recognition of the complete impairment of the company s goodwill in  ii continued significant discounting to wholesale distributors  iii continued high warranty costs  iv excess manufacturing capacity and related fixed costs caused by continued low volumes  and v a workers compensation reserve increase in these factors were exacerbated by weaker general economic conditions and declining consumer confidence during the period 
there are no assurances that the conditions that have resulted in the company s losses in and will not continue through and beyond 
cyclicality  seasonality and economic conditions 
the rv industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic conditions  which affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
concerns about the availability and price of gasoline  decreases in consumer confidence  increases in interest rates and reductions in available financing have had  and may in the future have  an adverse impact on rv sales 
sales of the company s products may be adversely affected by economic conditions  which economic conditions may be adversely affected by the threat or occurrence of armed conflict in iraq or elsewhere  and or the threat of terrorist attacks 
seasonal factors  over which the company has no control  also have an effect on the demand for the company s products 
demand in the rv industry declines over the winter season  while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
dependence on certain dealers and concentration of dealers in certain regions 
for the year ended december   two dealers accounted for and  respectively  of the company s annual net sales 
also  the company s top ten dealers accounted for approximately  and of the company s annual net sales during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss by the company of one or more of these dealers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s sales is from dealers located in states in the western part of the united states 
consequently  a general downturn in economic conditions or other material events in such region could materially adversely affect the company s sales 
dependence on chassis suppliers 
one of the principal components used in the manufacture of motorhomes is the chassis  which includes the engine  drive train and other operating components 
although country coach manufactures chassis used in its products and certain nrv models  the company obtains the required chassis for most of its nrv class a motorhomes from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is standard in the industry  arrangements with such suppliers permit them to terminate their relationship with the company at any time 
lead times for the delivery of chassis frequently exceed five weeks and the rv industry as a whole has from time to time experienced temporary shortages of chassis 
if any of the company s suppliers were to discontinue the manufacture of chassis utilized by the company in the manufacture of its class a motorhomes  materially reduce their availability to the rv industry in general or limit or terminate their availability to the company in particular  the business and financial condition of the company could be materially and adversely affected 
also  the company s top chassis suppliers accounted for approximately of the total chassis purchased through december  potential liabilities under repurchase agreements 
as is common in the industry  the company enters into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by its dealers to finance their purchases 
these agreements obligate the company to purchase a dealer s inventory under certain circumstances in the event of a default by the dealer to its lender 
the risk of loss  however  is spread over many dealers and is further reduced by the resale value of the rvs that the company would be required to repurchase 
although losses under these agreements have not been significant in the past  if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of rvs in the future  it could result in losses and a reduction in new rv sales 
the company s contingent obligations under repurchase agreements vary from period to period and totaled approximately million as of december  competition 
the company competes with numerous manufacturers  many of which have multiple product lines of rvs  are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
according to statistical surveys  inc  the three largest motorhome manufacturers had sales aggregating of industry wide retail unit sales of class a motorhomes for the year ended december  in addition  sales of used rvs provide competition to rv manufacturers 
government regulation 
the company is subject to federal  state and local regulations governing the manufacture and sale of their products  including the provisions of the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act the motor vehicle act  the transportation recall enhancement  accountability and documentation act the tread act and the federal motor vehicle safety standards fmvss 
certain states require approval of coach designs and provide certification tags proving compliance before coaches can be sold into that state 
the motor vehicle act authorizes the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with the fmvss 
in addition  the company has  from time to time  instituted voluntary recalls of certain motorhome and towable units 
future recalls of the company s products  if any  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is also subject to some federal and state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale  transportation and marketing of motor vehicles  including so called lemon laws 
federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight  length and width of motor vehicles  including trucks and motorhomes  that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
as a result of these restrictions  certain models of motorhomes manufactured by the company s country coach subsidiary may not be legally operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways 
certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions 
enforcement of these laws and related customer complaints to date has been limited 
the company is unable to predict reliably the extent of future enforcement of these laws  the extent future enforcement might lead to customer complaints  or the extent to which country coach may choose or be required to provide some customer remedy  such as repurchasing or exchanging motorhomes  as a result of such complaints 
if current enforcement efforts and related complaints were to increase significantly from their current levels  the cost of resolving such complaints  particularly should the resolution of complaints require repurchasing  refurbishing  and reselling of motorhomes  could have a material financial effect on the company 
amendments and changes in enforcement with respect to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new laws and regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing  purchasing  operating or selling the company s products and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the failure of the company to comply with these present or future laws or regulations could result in fines imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  or suspension of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to the use  generation  storage  treatment  emissions  and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and noise pollution 
such laws and regulations are becoming more stringent  and it is likely that future amendments to these environmental statutes and additional regulations promulgated thereunder will be applicable to the company  its manufacturing operations and its products in the future 
the failure of the company to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on the company  civil and criminal liability  suspension of operations  alterations to the manufacturing process or costly cleanup or capital expenditures 
warranty claims 
the company is subject to warranty claims in the ordinary course of its business 
although the company maintains reserves for such claims  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding the company s current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
product liability 
the company maintains product liability insurance with coverage in amounts which management believes is reasonable 
to date  the company has been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms the company considers acceptable 
given the nature of the company s business  product liability in excess of the company s insurance coverage  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
antitakeover provisions 
certain provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation  as well as delaware corporate law and the company s stockholder rights plan the rights plan  may be deemed to have anti takeover effects and may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest 
such provisions also may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
certain of such provisions allow the company s board of directors to issue  without additional stockholder approval  preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock 
in addition  the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits the company from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
in august  the company adopted the rights plan  pursuant to which holders of the common stock received a distribution of rights to purchase additional shares of common stock  which rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant financial instruments 
the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments 
the company does not have any significant foreign currency exposure because it does not transact business in foreign currencies 
however  we are exposed to market risk as a result of interest rate changes interest rate risk
