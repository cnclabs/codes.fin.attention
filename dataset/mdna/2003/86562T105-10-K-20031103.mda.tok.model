any future success that the company may achieve will depend upon many factors including factors which may be beyond the control of summa or which cannot be predicted at this time 
uncertainties and factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth or implied include changes in the markets for the products offered by the company through its operating subsidiaries increased levels of competition  including the entry of additional foreign and domestic competitors and increased success by existing competitors reduced margins caused by competitive pressures  expiration of patents and other factors increases in operating costs including costs of production  energy  materials  supplies  personnel  equipment  import duties and transportation increases in borrowing costs and or the availability of funds increases in insurance costs  or the failure or inability to obtain adequate levels of insurance increases in governmental regulation imposed under federal  state or local laws  including regulations applicable to environmental  labor and trade matters changes in governmental regulation  including changes affecting the favorable tax benefits for export sales made by domestic entities changing customer profiles general political  economic and industry conditions that affect customer demand and sales volume  both domestically and internationally the introduction of new products by competitors or the failure to gain acceptance of new company products the timing of summa s advertising and promotional campaigns effects on the company of its cost reduction initiatives the loss of key personnel critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the company s consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from current expectations 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect the company s financial statements impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company has a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should the company conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset are also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and future impairment charges 
new accounting standards adopted by the company effective september  required that the company perform a transitional fair value based impairment test for goodwill and required that goodwill be valued at the lower of carrying value or fair value 
for a summary of the impairment charge to goodwill taken by the company effective september   see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements below 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter 
significant management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of assets 
future changes in management s estimates could result in additional impairment charges to goodwill 
valuation of inventory 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value as permanent changes in the carrying amount of such inventory until its ultimate sale or other disposition 
the company has evaluated the current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competition differ from expectations 
accounts receivable 
the company performs ongoing evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
the company monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for stock options 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas  allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide pro forma income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for stock based awards as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations  compensation expense would generally be recorded for fixed option grants only if  on the date of the grant  the current price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the company s stock option plans and award of options to non employee directors
