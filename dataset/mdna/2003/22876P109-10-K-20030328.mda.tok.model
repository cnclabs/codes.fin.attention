management periodically reviews its investment in properties for evidence of impairments in value 
factors considered consist of  but are not limited to current and projected occupancy rates  market conditions in different geographic regions  and management s plans with respect to its properties 
if management were to conclude that expected cash flows would not enable the company to recover the carrying amount of its investments  losses would be recorded and asset values would be reduced 
no such impairments in value were recognized during  or liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   the company generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities 
the company s primary internal sources of cash are i the collection of rents from buildings owned by the company and ii the receipt of management fees paid to the company in respect of properties managed on behalf of ap knight lp and crocker realty trust 
as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the company is required to pay out annually  as dividends  percent of its reit taxable income which  due to non cash charges  including depreciation and net operating loss carryforwards  may be substantially less than cash flow 
in the past  the company has paid out dividends in amounts at least equal to its reit taxable income 
the company believes that its cash provided by operating activities and its current cash balance will be sufficient to cover debt service payments and to pay the dividends required to maintain reit status through the level of cash flow generated by rents depends primarily on the occupancy rates of the company s buildings and changes in rental rates on new and renewed leases and under escalation provisions contained in most leases 
as of december   approximately percent of the company s annualized gross rental revenues were derived from existing leases containing provisions for rent escalations 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents under such provisions 
as of december   leases representing approximately percent of the gross annualized rent from the company s properties  without regard to the exercise of options to renew  were due to expire during this represents approximately leases for space in buildings located in of the company s office projects 
certain of these tenants may not renew their leases or may reduce their demand for space 
leases were renewed on approximately percent  percent and percent of the company s rentable square feet  which were scheduled to expire during  and  respectively 
for those leases which renewed during  the average base rental rate increased from to  an increase of percent 
current market conditions in certain markets may require that rental rates at which leases are renewed or at which vacated space is leased be lower than rental rates under existing leases 
based upon the amount of leases which will expire during and the competition for tenants in the markets in which the company operates  the company has offered  and expects to continue to offer  incentives to certain new and renewal tenants 
these incentives may include the payment of tenant improvement costs and  in certain markets  reduced rents during initial lease periods 
the company has historically benefited from generally positive economic conditions and stable occupancy levels in many of the metropolitan areas in which the company owns office buildings 
the company believes that the southeastern and southwestern united states provides significant economic growth potential due to its diverse regional economies  expanding metropolitan areas  skilled work force and moderate labor costs 
however  the company is currently experiencing a slowdown in the demand for office space in the markets in which it owns office buildings 
cash flow from operations could be reduced if a weakened economy resulted in lower occupancy  declining market rental rates  and lower rental income for the company s office buildings  which may in turn affect the amount of dividends paid by the company 
for the properties owned on december   occupancy was percent 
governmental tenants including the state of florida and the united states of america  which accounted for percent of the company s leased space as of december   may be subject to budget reductions in times of recession and governmental austerity measures 
consequently  there can be no assurance that governmental appropriations for rents may not be reduced 
additionally  certain of the private sector tenants  which have contributed to the company s rent stream  may reduce their current demands  or curtail their future need  for additional office space

in order to generate funds sufficient to make principal payments in respect of indebtedness of the company over the long term  as well as necessary capital and tenant acquisition expenditures  the company will be required to successfully refinance its indebtedness or procure additional equity capital 
however  there can be no assurance that any such refinancing or equity financing will be achieved or will generate adequate funds on a timely basis for these purposes 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  further dilution to existing shareholders may result 
unfavorable conditions in the financial markets  the degree of leverage of the company and various other factors may limit the ability of the company to successfully undertake any such financings  and no assurance can be given as to the availability of alternative sources of funds

the company desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  together with related data and projections  about the company s projected financial results and its future plans and strategies 
however  actual results and needs of the company may vary materially from forward looking statements and projections made from time to time by the company on the basis of management s then current expectations 
the business in which the company is engaged involves changing and competitive markets and a high degree of risk  and there can be no assurance those forward looking statements and projections will prove accurate 
accordingly  the company hereby identifies the following important factors  which could cause the company s actual performance and financial results to differ materially from any results  which might be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by the company 
real estate financing risks existing debt 
the company is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  including a the risk that the company s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  b the risk that the existing debt in respect of the company s properties which in substantially all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity will not be able to be refinanced and c the risk that the terms of any refinancing of any existing debt will not be as favorable as the terms of such existing debt 
the company currently has outstanding debt of approximately million  all of which is secured by the company s properties 
approximately million of such debt will mature by the million secured revolving credit facility million of which had been borrowed at december  matures in december if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  the company expects that its cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all such maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates upon refinancing than the interest rates on the existing debt  the interest expense relating to such refinanced debt would increase  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and the amount of distributions the company would be able to make to its shareholders 
if the company has mortgaged a property to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to meet the mortgage payments  then the mortgagee may foreclose upon  or otherwise take control of  such property  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
risk of rising interest rates and variable rate debt 
the company currently has a million secured revolving credit facility and term loans with variable interest rates 
the company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
increases in interest rates on such debt could increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
existing leverage  no limitation on debt 
as of december   the debt to total market capitalization ratio of the company was approximately percent 
the company s policy regarding this ratio ie  total consolidated debt as a percentage of the sum of the market value of issued and outstanding capital stock plus total consolidated debt is not subject to any limitation in the organizational documents of the company 
accordingly  the board of directors could establish policies which would increase the company s debt to total market capitalization ratio subject to any existing debt covenants 
if this action were taken  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that a could adversely affect the company s cash flow and  consequently  the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders and b could increase the risk of default on the company s debt 
for purposes of establishing and evaluating its debt policy  the company measures its leverage by reference to the total market capitalization of the company rather than by reference to the book value of its assets 
the company has used total market capitalization because it believes that the book value of its assets which to a large extent is comprised of the depreciated value of real property  the company s primary tangible asset does not accurately reflect its ability to borrow and to meet debt service requirements 
the market capitalization of the company  however  is more variable than book value  and does not necessarily reflect the fair market value of the underlying assets of the company at all times 
the company also considers factors other than its market capitalization in making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness  such as the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing  the estimated market value of its properties upon refinancing and the ability of particular properties  and the company as a whole  to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service 
geographic concentration the company s revenues and the value of its properties may be affected by a number of factors  including the regional and local economic climates of the metropolitan areas in which the company s office projects are located which may be adversely impacted by business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  changing demographics and other factors and regional and local real estate conditions in such areas including oversupply of  or reduced demand for  office and other competing commercial properties 
all of the company s office projects are located in the southeastern united states and houston  texas 
there is also the risk of over building in certain sub markets located in markets which the company currently serves 
while the company has generally avoided acquiring or developing property in these sub markets such over built conditions may occur in sub markets where the company currently owns properties 
the company s performance and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are  therefore  dependent on economic conditions in these markets 
the company s historical growth has occurred during periods when the economy in the southeastern united states has out performed the national economy 
there can be no assurance as to the continued growth of the economy in the southeastern united states and houston  texas or the future growth rate of the company 
renewal of leases and reletting of space the company is subject to the risks that upon expiration of leases for space located in its buildings a such leases may not be renewed  b such space may not be relet or c the terms of renewal or reletting taking into account the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
leases on a total of percent and percent of the total rentable square feet leased in the company s buildings will expire in and  respectively 
if the company is unable to promptly relet  or renew the leases for  all or a substantial portion of the space located in its buildings  or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rental rates  or if the company s reserves for these purposes prove inadequate  the company s cash flow and its ability to make expected dividends to its shareholders may be adversely affected 
leases with state of florida at december   the company had leases with various departments and agencies of the state of florida which totaled approximately  rentable square feet 
the majority of these leases are for space in the company s office projects located in tallahassee  florida 
these leases have provisions for early termination for various reasons  including lack of budget appropriations 
during times of recession and government austerity measures  the state of florida may be subject to budget reductions and may decide to terminate certain of its leases prior to the contractual lease expiration date 
in addition  these leases provide the state of florida with the right to terminate  without penalty  prior to the contractual lease expiration date in the event a state owned building becomes available for occupancy upon giving six months advance written notice to the company 
during  the state of florida announced its intention to eliminate its department of labor  which had a direct impact on the company s property in tallahassee 
the company is currently evaluating the long term impact of this reorganization and is in negotiations with other state departments to reassign the vacated space 
real estate investment risks general risks 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend in large part on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if the company s properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including current levels of debt service  tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other capital expenditures  the company may have to borrow additional amounts to cover fixed costs and the company s cash flow and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will be adversely affected 
the company must obtain external financing to meet future debt maturities 
the company s net revenues and the value of its properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national  regional and local economic climates  regional and local real estate conditions  the perceptions of prospective tenants as to the attractiveness of the property  the ability of the company to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and increased operating costs including real estate taxes and utilities 
in addition  real estate values and income from properties are also affected by such factors as applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
illiquidity of real estate 
equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
such illiquidity will tend to limit the ability of the company to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
competition 
numerous office buildings compete with the company s office projects in attracting tenants to lease space 
some of these competing buildings are newer  better located or better capitalized than some of the company s buildings 
the company believes that major national or regional commercial property developers will continue to seek development opportunities in the southeastern and southwestern united states 
these developers may have greater financial resources than the company 
the number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse affect on the company s ability to lease space in its office projects or at newly developed or acquired properties or on the amount of rents charged 
changes in laws 
because increases in income  service or transfer taxes are generally not passed through to tenants under leases  such increases may adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
the company s properties are also subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as requirements of the americans with disabilities act the ada and state and local fire and life safety requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants 
the company believes that its properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by the company and could have an adverse affect on the company s cash flow and dividends paid 
uninsured loss 
the company presently carries comprehensive liability  fire  and flood where appropriate  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customary for similar properties 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as from wars or certain acts of terrorism  including nuclear  chemical  and biological attacks that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss exceeding policy limits occur  the company could lose both its capital invested in  and anticipated profits from  one or more of its properties 
bankruptcy and financial condition of tenants 
at any time  a tenant of the company s buildings may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in the cash flow available for distribution by the company 
no assurance can be given that tenants will not file for bankruptcy protection in the future or  if any tenants file  that they will affirm their leases and continue to make rental payments in a timely manner 
in addition  a tenant from time to time may experience a downturn in its business which may weaken its financial condition and result in its failure to make rental payments when due 
if a tenant s lease is not affirmed following bankruptcy or if a tenant s financial condition weakens  the company s income may be adversely affected 
americans with disabilities act compliance 
under the ada  all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements relating to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in compliance with the requirements of the ada could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
although the company believes that its properties are substantially in compliance with these requirements  the company may incur additional costs to comply with the ada 
although the company believes that such costs will not have a material adverse affect on the company  if required changes involve a greater expenditure than the company currently anticipates  the company s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders could be adversely affected 
risks involved in property ownership through partnership and joint ventures 
although the company owns fee simple interests in all of its properties  in the future the company could  if then permitted by the covenants in its loan agreements and its financial position  participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships or joint ventures 
partnership or joint venture investments may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not otherwise present in property ownership  including the possibility that a the company s partners or co ventures might become bankrupt  b such partners or co ventures might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with the business interests or goals of the company  and c such partners or co ventures may be in a position to take action contrary to the instructions or the requests of the company or contrary to the company s policies or objectives  including the company s policy to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the company will  however  seek to maintain sufficient control of such participants or joint ventures to permit the company s business objectives to be achieved 
there is no limitation under the company s organizational documents as to the amount of available funds that may be invested in partnerships or joint ventures 
impact of inflation 
the company may experience increases in its expenses  including debt service  as a result of inflation 
the company s exposure to inflationary cost increases in property level expenses is reduced by escalation clauses  which are included in most of its leases 
however  market conditions may prevent the company from escalating rents 
inflationary pressure may increase operating expenses  including labor and energy costs and  indirectly  real estate taxes above expected levels at a time when it may not be possible for the company to increase lease rates to offset such higher operating expenses 
in addition  inflation can have secondary effects upon occupancy rates by decreasing the demand for office space in many of the markets in which the company operates 
although inflation has historically often caused increases in the value of income producing real estate through higher rentals  the company can provide no assurance that inflation  when and if it occurs  will increase the value of its properties in the future 
risk of development  construction and acquisition activities within the constraints of its policy concerning leverage  the company has and will continue to develop and construct office buildings  particularly on its undeveloped land 
risks associated with the company s development and construction activities  including activities relating to its undeveloped land  may include abandonment of development opportunities  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates and possibly making the property uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property insufficient to make the property profitable  unavailability of financing on favorable terms for development of a property  and the failure to complete construction and lease up on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development activities are subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
the company will continue to acquire office buildings 
acquisitions of office buildings entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the cost of improvements to bring an acquired building up to standards established for the market position intended for such building may prove inaccurate 
in addition  there are general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
the company anticipates that any future developments and acquisitions would be financed through a combination of internally generated cash  equity investments and secured or unsecured financing 
if new developments are financed through construction loans  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for newly developed properties may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms 
changes in policies without shareholder approval the investment  financing  borrowing and distribution policies of the company  as well as its policies with respect to all other activities  including growth  debt  capitalization and operations  are determined by the board of directors 
although the board of directors has no present intention to do so  these policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the shareholders of the company 
a change in these policies could adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of the company or the market price of the common stock 
limitations of reit status on business of subsidiaries certain requirements for reit qualification may in the future limit the company s ability to increase fee development  management and leasing operations conducted  and related services offered  by the company s subsidiaries without jeopardizing the company s qualification as a reit 
adverse consequences of failure to qualify as a reit the company believes it has operated so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code since its inception in although management of the company intends that the company continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit  no assurance can be given that the company will remain qualified as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the application and satisfaction of highly technical and complex code requirements for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
uncertainty in the application of such requirements  as well as circumstances not entirely within the company s control  may affect the company s ability to qualify as a reit 
in addition  no assurance can be given that legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
the company  however  is not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect the company s ability to operate as a reit 
possible environmental liabilities under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew  or caused the presence  of the contaminants  and the liability under such laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility 
the costs of investigation  remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate the contamination on such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of a release of hazardous or toxic substances at such disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs that it incurs in connection with the contamination 
finally  the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site 
certain federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances govern the removal  encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials acm when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for release of acm and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acm 
in connection with its ownership and operation of its properties  the company may be potentially liable for such costs 
all acm in the company s buildings has been found to be in good condition and non friable  and should not present a risk as long as it continues to be properly managed 
the company s environmental assessments of its properties have not revealed any environmental liability that the company believes would have a material adverse affect on its business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole  nor is the company aware of any such material environmental liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that the company s assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material environmental liabilities of which the company is unaware 
moreover  there can be no assurance that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or the current environmental condition of the company s properties will not be affected by tenants  by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of such properties such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to the company 
effect of market interest rates on price of common stock one of the factors that will influence the market price of the company s common stock in public markets will be the annual dividend yield on the share price reflected by dividends paid by the company 
an increase in market interest rates could reduce cash available for distribution by the company to its shareholders and  accordingly  adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
additional information for additional disclosure of risk factors to which the company is subject  see the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company currently has a million secured revolving credit facility and term loans with variable interest rates 
the company may incur additional variable rate debt in the future to meet its financing needs 
increases in interest rates on such debt could increase the company s interest expense  which would adversely affect the company s cash flow and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
the company has not entered into any interest rate hedge contracts in order to mitigate the interest rate risk with respect to the secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had million outstanding under loans with variable interest rates 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower  annual interest expense would be increased or decreased by approximately  additionally  the company had million outstanding under loans with fixed interest rates as of december  the company may incur additional fixed rate debt in the future to meet its financing needs 
should market interest rates decline  the company s use of fixed rate debt financing may result in the recognition of interest expense at rates higher than market rates 
if the market interest rate on this fixed rate debt were basis points lower  the company would forfeit annual interest expense savings of approximately  as compared to variable rate debt financing
