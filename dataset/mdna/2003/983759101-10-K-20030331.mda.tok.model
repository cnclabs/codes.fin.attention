item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
this discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
this annual report on form k is filed by xm satellite radio holdings inc xm satellite radio inc is filing separately 
the principal differences between the financial condition of holdings and xm  which are not significant in amount  are the ownership by holdings of the corporate headquarters building since august  and the lease of the building from holdings by xm  the presence at holdings of additional indebtedness not guaranteed by xm  and the existence of cash balances at holdings 
accordingly  the results of operations for xm and its subsidiaries are substantially the same as the results for holdings and its subsidiaries discussed above except that xm incurs additional rent  less depreciation and amortization expense and less other income  in each case principally related to xm s rental of its corporate headquarters from holdings  which are intercompany transactions that have been eliminated in the holdings financial statements  less interest expense principally related to the additional indebtedness at holdings  and less interest income because of the additional cash balances at holdings 
overview xm was incorporated in delaware in and holdings became a holding company for xm in early we emerged from the development stage in the fourth quarter of  following the commencement of our service in two test markets on september  and nationwide launch on november  accordingly  the results for the year ended december  reflect limited commercial operations and the direct comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and may not be meaningful with respect to revenue and various other line items 
at completion of the year ended december   our first full year of operations  we had  subscribers 
we raised billion of equity and debt net proceeds through december  from investors and strategic partners to fund our operations 
on january   we completed a million financing  which included million of new funds bringing to billion the amount of equity and debt raised and million of payment deferrals and a line of credit 
following completion of this january financing  so long as we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our refined business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations 
our business plan contemplates the use of either insurance proceeds and or vendor financing to launch replacement satellite s 
we will continue to incur operating losses until we substantially increase the number of our subscribers and develop a stream of cash flow sufficient to cover operating costs 
we also have significant outstanding contracts and commercial commitments that need to be paid in cash or through credit facilities over the next several years  including to fund subsidies and distribution costs  particularly under our arrangement with general motors  programming costs  repayment of long term debt  lease payments and service payments  as further described below under the heading liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our ability to become profitable also depends upon other factors identified below under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital requirements 

table of contents results of operations to better explain our performance for and on an on going basis  we have expanded the number of revenue and expense categories to better reflect the drivers of the business

in  we recognized million in total revenue  compared to million in  an increase of million 
in  subscription related revenues comprised over of our total revenues 
as of december   we had  subscribers  compared to  at december   an increase of  subscribers 
we consider subscribers to be those who are receiving and have agreed to pay for our service  either by credit card or by invoice  including those who are currently in promotional periods 
we expect revenue to increase substantially during as we continue to add subscribers and attract additional advertisers 
subscriber revenue 
revenue from subscribers consists of subscription revenue  activation revenue and equipment sales 
subscriber related revenue was million for  compared to  for subscription revenue consists primarily of our monthly subscription fees charged to consumers  commercial establishments and fleets  which is recognized as the service is provided 
subscription revenue also includes revenues from premium service 
our subscriber arrangements are cancelable  without penalty 
promotions and discounts are treated as a reduction to revenue during the period of the promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of rebates to subscribers  offset revenue 
subscription revenue 
total subscription revenue during was million  compared to million during  an increase of million 
average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber arpu was approximately during  and during average monthly subscription revenue per subscriber is derived from the total of earned subscription revenue net of promotions and rebates divided by the monthly weighted average number of ending subscribers for the period reported 
we made two changes to our calculation of arpu as compared to numbers presented in prior quarters in an effort to provide a metric that we feel is more reflective of our earned recurring monthly subscription revenue 
first  we no longer include earned activation revenue as part of the arpu calculation 
we also refined our methodology to calculate arpu using a denominator of monthly weighted average customers rather than our previous approach of daily weighted average customers to be consistent with how we manage our business 
average monthly revenue per subscriber is a measure of operational performance and not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
we expect average monthly revenue per subscriber to remain relatively stable to reflect promotions implemented in  multiradio discount plans such as the new family plan and the introduction of new subscription services 
activation equipment revenue 
activation equipment revenue is comprised of one time activation charges billed to customers and revenues from any direct sales of radios 
activation fees are non refundable  and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the estimated average term of the subscriber relationship 
we expect this estimate to be further refined in the future as additional historical data becomes available 
in we recognized  in activation revenue compared to  during  an increase of  revenue from the sale of equipment was  during compared to in we expect activation revenue to increase during as we increase subscribers  and we expect revenue from the sale of equipment to increase proportionately with the increase in direct sales of equipment by xm

revenue share royalties 
revenue share royalties includes royalties paid to radio technology providers  revenue share payments to content providers  and performance rights obligations to composers  artists  and copyright owners for public performances of their creative works broadcast on xm 
these costs were million in compared to million in this increase of million was a result of our growth in subscriber base and revenues along with completion of negotiations for performance rights royalties 
we expect these total costs to increase during as subscriber growth continues but to decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue 
customer care billing 
customer care billing operations expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million 
this increase resulted from a full year of commercial operations and increase of subscribers 
we expect customer care billing operations expense in total to increase during as we continue to add subscribers  but we expect the average cost per subscriber to decrease

satellite terrestrial includes telemetry  tracking and control of our two satellites  in orbit satellite insurance and incentive payments  satellite uplink  and all costs associated with operating our terrestrial repeater network such as power  maintenance and lease payments 
these expenses were million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease primarily resulted from a charge of million in compared to a charge of million in related to terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
exclusive of this charge  we incurred increased operating expenses in compared to as our satellites and terrestrial repeater network performed over a first full year of operations 
we expect system operating costs to decline slightly in as we complete optimization efforts with respect to our terrestrial repeater network 
broadcast operations broadcast 
broadcast expenses include costs associated with the management and maintenance of the systems  software  hardware  production and performance studios used in the creation and distribution of xm original and third party content 
the advertising trafficking scheduling and insertion functions are also included 
broadcast costs were million for  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase reflects a full year of operations for based on our current channel lineup  these costs are expected to remain stable in 
table of contents operations 
operations  which includes facilities and information technology expense  was million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in operations expense in is attributed to a decrease in rent expense which was a direct result of the purchase of our corporate headquarters in the third quarter of and a decrease in costs incurred for professional services related to information technology as a result of a decreased need for post implementation support

these combined expenses were million in  compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in research and development expense primarily resulted from the higher cost of designing the initial chipset in compared with subsequent chipset designs in when the manufacturers absorbed a portion of the engineering charges 
we expect research development expense to increase substantially in compared to levels as a result of development of future telematics applications and new products  including interoperable radios 
general administrative 
general administrative expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million or 
the increase in general administrative expense primarily resulted from increased director and officer insurance premiums in the fourth quarter  and costs incurred in for the bond exchange transaction

personnel related expenses and costs associated with maintaining the corporate web site comprise the majority of retention and support 
in  these costs were million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
we expect these expenses to remain relatively stable during subsidies distribution 
we currently provide incentives and subsidies for the manufacture  purchase  installation and activation of xm radios to attract and retain our manufacturing and distribution partners 
our subsidy and distribution costs are significant and totaled approximately million during  compared with million during  an increase of million due to being a full year of operations 
we expect total subsidy distribution expense to increase during as our number of subscribers increases  however  we expect the cost per new subscriber to decrease 
subscriber acquisition costs 
we consider subscriber acquisition costs to include radio manufacturer subsidies  certain sales  activation and installation commissions  and subscriber product and hardware related incentives 
these costs are represented in subsidies distribution 
subscriber acquisition costs do not include ongoing loyalty payments to retailers and distribution partners  payments under revenue sharing arrangements with radio manufacturers and distributors and certain guaranteed payments to general motors

we expect these expenses to decrease during cost per gross addition 
we consider cpga to include the amounts in sac  as well as advertising  media and most marketing expenses 
in our financial statements  sac costs are captured in the subsidies distribution  while cpga costs are captured by the combination of the subsidies distribution  advertising marketing  plus the negative margins from equipment sales 
cpga does not include marketing staff and subscriber communication costs found in retention support or the amortization of the gm guaranteed payments found in amortization of gm liability 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
cpga for the full year was due to our launch late in and significant pre operations costs recorded  cpga figures for and prior are not meaningful 
the amount of these total costs will vary in future years  but is expected to decrease on a per subscriber addition basis during  spreading the less variable components of our costs over a larger subscriber base 
ad sales 
ad sales expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
we expect ad sales costs to increase in in support of advertising revenue growth 
amortization of gm liability 
these costs include the amortization of annual fixed guaranteed payment commitments to general motors  aggregating to million  under our long term distribution agreement with the onstar division of gm providing for the installation of xm radios in gm vehicles 
in we expensed  the annual fixed payment for that year 
we amended the agreement in june  and following the amendment began amortizing the annual fixed payments due through november  which approximated million  on a straight line basis 
we expensed million for  reflecting a pro rata portion of the fixed annual payment for the period from january through june and the straight line portion of the million for the remainder of the distribution agreement was amended again in january  as described above under the captions recent sales of unregistered securities transactions with general motors and liquidity and capital resources capital resources and financing 
as a result of the january amendment and gm s current roll out plans  commencing in february we will recognize the fixed annual payments due through september  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
consequently  we expect these expenses to increase to million for and million per annum in subsequent years

we recognized an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
required that we perform an assessment of the fair value of our reporting unit and compared it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as a result of the value of our stock and other securities being impacted by negative trends in the capital markets during  our market capitalization had fallen below our book value  indicating that our reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed the second step of the annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and recognized an impairment charge of million as required by sfas no 
depreciation amortization 
depreciation amortization expense was million during  compared with million during  an increase of million 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from our commencing depreciation of major components of our system  including our satellites and terrestrial systems  upon commencement of commercial operations in september during  we ceased amortizing goodwill and our dars license in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
as a result of a solar array output power anomaly  during  we reduced the useful lives of our in orbit satellites from years to years 
as a result of reducing the lives of our satellites  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to trend significantly higher during interest income 
interest income was million during  compared with million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was the result of lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents during coupled with lower yields on our investments due to market conditions

table of contents as a result of our financings and other issuances of securities  the conversion price of the series c preferred stock has been adjusted from to  the exercise price of the warrants sold in march from to and the number of warrant shares from to 
future operating and capital resource requirements we have refined our business plan based on what we have learned during our first full year of commercial service and our available resources 
we are focusing on the new automobile market to take advantage of our relationships with automobile manufacturers  the introduction of lower priced and more user friendly radio technology in the retail aftermarket and the use of our most productive distribution channels 
we have also reduced spending on advertising and streamlined our workforce 
provided that we meet the revenue  expense and cash flow projections of our refined business plan  we expect to be fully funded and will not need to raise additional financing to continue operations 
our business plan contemplates the use of either insurance proceeds and or vendor financing to launch replacement satellite s 
our business plan is based on estimates regarding expected future costs and expected revenue 
our costs may exceed or our revenues may fall short of our estimates  our estimates may change  and future developments may affect our estimates 
any of these factors may increase our need for funds  which would require us to seek additional financing 
in addition  we may seek additional financing to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we may pursue a range of different sizes or types of financing as opportunities arise  particularly the sale of additional equity securities 
however  we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in developing  implementing and marketing our satellite radio service  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in further dilution to our equity holders 
we have and may continue to take advantage of opportunities to reduce our level of indebtedness in exchange for issuing equity securities  if these transactions can be completed on favorable terms 

table of contents if we fail to obtain necessary financing on a timely basis  a number of adverse effects could occur 
we could default on our commitments to creditors or others and may have to discontinue operations or seek a purchaser for our business or assets 
our need for additional funds may also be affected by future developments 
in september  bss advised us of a progressive degradation problem with the solar array output power of boeing class satellites  including xm rock and xm roll 
at the present time  the output power of the solar arrays and the broadcast signal strength are above minimum acceptable levels and are expected to remain that way at least through  permitting full operation of the xm system based on patterns projected by bss 
we have launch and in orbit insurance policies that provide coverage to us for a total  constructive total or partial loss of either of our satellites where such loss arises from an occurrence within the first five years after launch both satellites were launched during the first half of 
the aggregate sum insured in the event of the total or constructive total loss of our satellites is million million per satellite 
in september  we advised our insurance carriers that the aforementioned solar array situation was likely to result in a claim under our in orbit insurance policies and  in the first quarter of  we filed a claim with the insurance carriers for the aggregate sum insured less applicable salvage  we believe we will ultimately receive insurance payments adequate to launch our spare satellite and commence work on an additional satellite  although there is no assurance that will be the case 
since the issue is common to boeing class satellites  the manufacturer and we are closely watching the progression of the problem  including data from a satellite that has been in orbit longer than either of our two satellites by approximately and months  respectively 
with this advance visibility of performance levels  insurance arrangements in place and claim filed  a spare satellite under construction that is being modified to address the solar power anomaly  the ability to provide full service for some period of time with rock and roll collocated in one orbit slot and the spare located in the other slot which would allow partial use of the existing satellites through the first quarter of  availability of comparable satellites from more than one vendor  and various mitigation actions to extend the full or partial use of the satellites  we believe that we will be able to launch additional satellites prior to the time the solar power problem might cause the broadcast signal strength to fall below minimum acceptable levels 
based on the consistency of the degradation trends with no substantial improvement to date and continuing analyses by bss and us  our management adjusted the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites  with effect from september  to the period running through first quarter approximately years from launch 
our management will continue to monitor this situation carefully and may re adjust the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites based on future information 
we are not recording an impairment at this time  due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be of use in our system 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make significant payments under a variety of contracts and other commercial arrangements  including the following service providers 
we have entered into an agreement with a service provider for customer care functions to subscribers of our service through november employees of this service provider have access to our customer care systems to establish customer accounts  activate radios  update program and account information and respond to general inquires from subscribers 
we pay an hourly rate for each customer care representative supporting our subscribers 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred   and  respectively  in relation to this agreement 
programming agreements 
we have also entered into various long term programming agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  we are obligated to provide payments to other entities that may include fixed 
table of contents payments  advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred expenses of million  million and  respectively  in relation to these agreements 
the amount of these costs will vary in future years  but is expected to increase in the next year as the number of subscribers and advertising revenue increase 
the amount of the costs related to these agreements cannot be estimated  but are expected to be substantial future costs 
of these amounts    and  respectively  are included in revenue share royalties  and million  million  and  respectively  are included in advertising marketing 
royalty agreements 
we have entered into fixed and variable revenue share payment agreements with performance rights organizations that expire as late as during the years ended december   and  we incurred expenses of million   and  respectively  in relation to these agreements 
marketing distribution agreements 
we have entered into various joint sales  marketing and distribution agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  we are obligated to provide incentives  subsidies and commissions to other entities that may include fixed payments  per unit radio and subscriber amounts and revenue sharing arrangements 
as previously described  we subsidize the manufacture of certain component parts of xm radios in order to provide attractive pricing to our customers 
the subsidies are generally charged to expense when the radios are manufactured or shipped from the factory 
consequently  the expense is most often recognized in advance of when revenue  if any  is realized 
the amount of these operational  promotional  subscriber acquisition  joint development  and manufacturing costs related to these agreements cannot be estimated  but are expected to be substantial future costs 
during the years ended december    and  we incurred expenses of million  million and  respectively  in relation to these agreements  excluding expenses related to gm 
general motors distribution agreement

as a result of the june amendment  we commenced recognizing these fixed payment obligations for the period ending through november  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
however  due to the january amendment to the distribution agreement and gm s current roll out plans which demonstrate a likelihood that gm will exceed minimum installation targets  in we are now prospectively recognizing these fixed payments due through september  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
we have issued a senior secured convertible note due with an aggregate principal amount of  to onstar in lieu of making these fixed payments to onstar for amounts otherwise due in through in order to encourage the broad installation of xm radios in gm vehicles  we have agreed to subsidize a portion of the cost of xm radios  and to make incentive payments to gm when the owners of gm vehicles with installed xm radios become subscribers for our service 
we must also share with gm a percentage of the subscription revenue attributable to gm vehicles with installed xm radios  which percentage increases until there are more than million gm vehicles with installed xm radios at which point the percentage remains constant 
we will also make available to gm bandwidth on our system 
as part of the agreement  onstar 
table of contents provides certain call center related services directly to xm subscribers who are also onstar customers and xm must reimburse onstar for these xm related call center services 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation at any time based upon the installation of radios that are compatible with a unified standard or capable of receiving sirius satellite radio s service 
the agreement is subject to renegotiation if as of november  and at two year intervals thereafter  gm does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels of gm vehicles capable of receiving our service  starting with  units by november  and thereafter increasing by the lesser of  units per year and amounts proportionate to target market shares in the satellite digital radio service market 
there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any such renegotiations 
general motors exclusivity obligations will discontinue if  by november and at two year intervals thereafter  we fail to achieve and maintain specified minimum market share levels in the satellite digital radio service market we are currently in excess of the minimum market share levels

these charges relate to stock options granted to employees and non employees and warrants granted to sony and cnbc 
additional compensation charges may result depending upon the market value of our class a common stock at each balance sheet date 
related party transactions we developed strategic relationships with certain companies that were instrumental in the construction and development of our system 
in connection with our granting to them of large supply contracts  some of these strategic companies have become large investors in us and have been granted rights to designate directors or observers to our board of directors 
the negotiation of these supply contracts and investments primarily occurred at or prior to the time these companies became related parties

bss also provided ground equipment and software used in the xm radio system and certain launch and operations support services 
the contract also provides for in orbit incentives to be earned depending on the performance of the in orbit satellites over their useful lives 
future payments under the satellite contract could total up to an additional million over the useful lives of the satellites 
on december   bss and we amended the satellite contract so as to permit the deferral of approximately million of payments to be made under the agreement  as well as to provide certain additional rights and obligations to us  including the launch of the ground spare satellite on the sealaunch launch vehicle should the ground spare satellite be launched between specified dates 
amounts deferred under the 
table of contents satellite contract include i million of the purchase price for the ground spare satellite and ii million of in orbit incentive payments relating to our two existing satellites  xm rock and xm roll 
interest will accrue on the million commencing when the ground spare satellite is available for shipment it is currently being modified to address the solar power anomaly  and the principal of such amount is to be paid on december  similarly  the million of incentive payments relating to rock and roll has been deferred with interest payable currently  with the principal amount to the extent earned payable on december  after december   bss must repay us incentive amounts that are not earned on a current basis 
incentive payment amounts are earned and expensed through operations on a daily basis for each day that a satellite meets or exceeds its applicable performance specifications 
under the amendment  the deferred amounts bear interest at the rate of  compounded annually  and are payable quarterly in arrears 
as of december   we had paid approximately million under our satellite contract and had recognized an additional liability of million for deferred in orbit incentives and related interest 
terrestrial repeater system 
as of december   we incurred aggregate costs of approximately million for a terrestrial repeater system 
these costs covered the capital cost of the design  development and installation of a system of terrestrial repeaters to cover approximately cities and metropolitan areas 
in august  we signed a contract with lcc international lcci for engineering and site preparation 
as of december   we had paid million under this contract 
there are no further payments due under the lcci contract

these costs were related to the satellite control facilities  programming production studios and various other equipment and facilities 
joint development agreement funding requirements 
we may require additional funds to contribute toward the development of technologies supporting a unified standard for satellite radios under our joint development agreement with sirius radio 
each party is obligated to fund one half of the development cost for such technologies 
the prior arbitration with sirius has been resolved  with no payment by either side 
long term debt 
we have raised funds from issuing long term debt on several occasions 
in march  xm issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due following our january financing  less than million of these notes remained outstanding 
principal on the senior secured notes due is payable at maturity  while interest is payable semi annually 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in july and august  holders of convertible subordinated notes exchanged million of notes for  shares of our class a common stock 
as a result of these transactions  approximately million of the notes remained 
principal on the convertible subordinated notes is payable at maturity  while interest is payable semi annually

lease obligations 
we have noncancelable operating leases for office space and terrestrial repeater sites and noncancelable capital leases for equipment that expire over the next ten years 
as discussed below  in december  we determined that the planned number of terrestrial repeater sites could be reduced due to the relative signal strength provided by our satellites 
we recognized a charge of million with respect to terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
this charge includes a lease termination liability of million for terrestrial repeater site leases  which would reduce the future minimum lease payments 
this liability was increased by million during as of december   we maintained a liability of million for the estimated lease termination costs and costs to deconstruct the sites 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   as adjusted for the january financing payments due by period contractual obligations and beyond total in thousands gm distribution agreement gm credit facility gm note other long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the above amounts do not include interest  which in some cases is variable in amount 
the long term debt payments due in include the maturity of our million of convertible subordinated notes  our million loan to finance the purchase of our headquarters facility  and our million borrowing from boeing 
we expect our million credit facility with general motors  which may be payable prior to maturity based on cash flows  to become payable as early as the long term debt payments due in and beyond include the maturity of xm s remaining outstanding

as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those pertaining to the following policies 
senior management has discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of estimates and assumptions required for the following accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from subscribers consists of our monthly subscription fee  which is recognized as the service is provided  and a non refundable activation fee  which is recognized on a pro rata basis over an estimated term of the subscriber relationship currently months  which was based upon market studies and management s judgment 
we expect to refine this estimate as more data becomes available 
promotions and discounts are treated as an offset to revenue during the period of promotion 
sales incentives  consisting of discounts and rebates to subscribers  offset earned revenue 
if the actual term of our subscriber relationships is significantly greater than our current estimate of months  the period over which we recognize the non refundable activation fee will be extended to reflect the actual term of our subscriber relationships 
estimates of payments due to manufacturers and distributors payments owed to manufacturing and distribution partners are expensed during the month in which the manufacture  sale  and or activation of the radio unit occurs 
the amount of these expenses are dependent upon units provided by our internal systems and processes  such as subscriber management system and supply chain management system and partner systems and processes 
however  due to lags in receiving manufacturing and sales data from partners  estimates of amounts due are necessary in order to record monthly expenses 
in subsequent months when lagged data is received from partners  expenses are reconciled  and adjusted where necessary 
since launching commercial operations  we continue to refine the estimation process based on an increased understanding of the timing lags  and close working relationships with our partners 
generally  estimates recorded on our books are adjusted to actuals within two months 
useful life of satellites and spacecraft control facilities following receipt of our satellites  we extended their expected lives from years  the initial design life  to years based upon updated technical estimates we received from our satellite provider following our satellite launches 
however  based on the consistency of the degradation trends with no substantial improvement to date and continuing analyses by boeing satellite systems and us  as described above under the heading liquidity and capital resources future operating and capital resource requirements  we adjusted the estimated useful life of our in orbit satellites with effect from september  to the period running through first quarter of approximately years from launch 
we continue to monitor the situation and may need to re adjust the estimated useful lives of our in orbit satellites based on future information 
we are not recording an impairment at this time  due to our forecasted cash flows which are sufficient to recover the system assets  however  should we reduce or not meet our forecasted cash flows or reduce further the estimated useful lives of the satellites  we may be required to record an impairment which may be substantial at that time 
we have not adjusted the estimated useful lives of our spacecraft control facilities  as we believe that these facilities will continue to be used in our xm system 
a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of our satellites and spacecraft control facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period in which the estimate is revised and in subsequent periods 

table of contents accrued network optimization expenses as a result of the planned reduction of the number of terrestrial repeater sites  we recognized a charge of million in compared to million in the charge of million in included million of site specific capitalized costs that were written off and a lease termination accrual of million for terrestrial repeater site leases 
the charge of million in represents additional costs associated with terminating leases on terrestrial repeater sites no longer required 
at december   we had recorded a lease termination accrual of million that represents an estimate of the costs to terminate the remaining leases based on management s judgment  advice of lease consultants  and early negotiations with landlords 
the liability also includes the estimated costs to deconstruct the existing sites  which are based upon quotes from contractors 
this amount could vary significantly from the actual amount incurred  which will be primarily based on our ability to negotiate lease termination settlements 
programming agreements we have entered into various programming agreements 
under the terms of these agreements  we are obligated to provide payments and commissions to other entities that may include fixed payments  advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements 
fixed amounts due under programming agreements are recognized on a straight line basis though the termination and or renegotiation date defined in the agreements 
revenue share agreements that contain minimum guarantees are recorded as an expense based upon the greater of the revenue share amount or a pro rata portion of the guarantee over the guarantee period 
distribution agreement with general motors we have significant payment obligations under our distribution agreement with general motors  which was amended on january  to provide that we could make certain payments by issuance of indebtedness or shares of class a common stock 
this agreement is subject to renegotiation if general motors does not achieve and maintain specified installation levels  starting with  by november and thereafter increasing by the lesser of  units per year and amounts proportionate to our share of the satellite digital radio market 
in light of gm s initial roll out plans  the june amendment of the distribution agreement and management s assessment of the likelihood of renegotiating during the period ending  we recognized the fixed payment obligations due to gm for the period through november  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
in light of the january amendment of the distribution agreement and gm s current roll out plans which demonstrate a likelihood of gm exceeding minimum installation targets  in we are prospectively recognizing fixed payment obligations to gm for the period through september  which approximate million  on a straight line basis 
additional annual fixed payment obligations beyond range from million to approximately million through  aggregating approximately million 
dars license 
we determined that our dars license was an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life 
while the dars license has a renewable eight year term  we believe that the administrative fees necessary to renew the license are expected to be de minimis compared to the initial fee to obtain the license  and we have met all of the established milestones specified in the dars license agreement 
we also anticipate no difficulties in renewing the license as long as we continue to adhere to the various regulatory requirements established in the license grant 
although we face competition from a variety of sources  we do not believe that the risk of the technology becoming obsolete or that a decrease in demand for the dars service is significant 
further  we believe that our license is comparable with the licenses granted to other broadcasters  which are also classified as indefinite lived intangible assets 
we understand that there continues to be deliberations concerning the application of this standard regarding the effect of the costs to renew fcc licenses 
our application of this standard could change depending upon the results of these deliberations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not intend to use derivatives 
we do not hold or issue any free standing derivatives 
we invest our cash in short term commercial paper  investment grade corporate and government obligations and money market funds 
our long term debt includes fixed interest rates and the fair market value of the debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we run the risk that market rates will decline and the required payments will exceed those based on current market rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the mortgage on our corporate headquarters has a variable interest rate that may not exceed a ceiling rate of or a floor rate of 
our loan from boeing also has a variable interest rate 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to this million of variable rate debt at december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in our annual interest expense 
additionally  we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is not material to our results of operations
