business overview the company is a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that began operations through a related entity in as of december   the company owned or controlled industrial  office and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of over million square feet located in states  and owned or controlled approximately  acres of land with an estimated future development potential of approximately million square feet of industrial  office and retail properties 
the company provides the following services for its properties and for certain properties owned by third parties leasing  management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from the rental operations of its properties 
this rental income is substantially influenced by the supply and demand for the company s rental space 
the company s continued growth is dependent upon its ability to maintain occupancy rates and increase rental rates of its in service portfolio 
the company s strategy for growth also includes developing and acquiring additional rental properties 
rental operations revenues decreased from million in to million in  as the effects of a weakened economy lingered in the company s markets for and the occupancy level of the company s in service portfolio decreased from at december   to at december  due to the following factors the low occupancy levels of new developments placed in service over the last twelve to eighteen months as a result of slow lease up activity  the slowdown in demand in many of the company s markets from the weakened economy  and the effects of the company s disposition activities in and during which the company sold over billion of assets in an effort to de leverage the company s balance sheet and dispose of unwanted properties while these events have affected growth and related rental income  the company believes that is has strong liquidity and financial flexibility see additional discussion under liquidity and capital resources 
with a debt to market capitalization ratio of and million available on its unsecured line of credit as of december   the company believes that it is positioned to fund its operational expenses and shareholder distributions and to make future opportunistic real estate investments 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that the company considers critical for future revenue growth all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect of both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures same property performance the company tracks same property performance  which measures the performance of properties that were in service for all reported portions of a two year period by comparing the results of the second year with the results of the first year 
in  net operating income from the same property portfolio increased just 
over  compared to growth in over the lower growth in same property performance resulted from lower occupancies in the properties that rolled into the same property population in  coupled with the fact that a majority of the properties sold over the past two years were from the same property population and were over leased 
the lower occupancy on our same property population was slightly offset by an increase in net effective rents  however  rental rate growth has decreased significantly from and occupancy analysis as discussed above  the ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of the company s results of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding the company s in service portfolio of rental properties as of december  and square feet in thousands total square feet percent of total square feet percent occupied type industrial service centers bulk office retail total the company s lower occupancy percentage in as compared to was primarily caused by slower lease up of new developments placed in service during and and reduced demand for existing space 
while the decline in occupancy appears to be slowing  and the company is focused on leasing existing space  management cannot predict when the occupancy of these properties will increase 
lease expiration the company s ability to maintain and grow its occupancy rates primarily depends upon its continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects the company s in service lease expiration schedule as of december   by product type 
the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands total portfolio industrial office retail year of expiration square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars square feet dollars and thereafter total portfolio square feet percent occupied lease renewals the company renewed of leases up for renewal in  totaling million square feet on which it attained a growth in net effective rents 
slower demand for rental space reduced rental rates during the company does not currently expect its renewal percentage or its growth in net effective rents on new leases in to significantly differ from the re leasing activity in future development the company also expects to realize growth in earnings from rental operations through the development and acquisition of additional rental properties 
specifically  the company has approximately million square feet of properties under development at december  these properties under development should provide future earnings through service operations income upon sale or from rental operations growth as they are placed in service as follows in thousands  except percent leased and stabilized returns anticipated in service date square feet percent leased project costs anticipated stabilized return held for rental st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter held for sale st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter total results of operations a summary of the company s operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share amounts rental operations revenues service operations revenues earnings from rental operations earnings from service operations operating income net income available for common shares weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common and dilutive potential common shares basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year under development square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental operations rental operations are comprised of net income from rental properties rental net income and equity in earnings from unconsolidated companies equity in earnings 
rental net income is defined as rental income less rental expenses and real estate taxes 
overall  rental net income decreased from million in to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to an overall decrease in occupancy of the company s in service portfolio from at december   to at december  this decrease is the result of the weakened economy and its effect on business in the company s markets 
these markets are experiencing a shortage of demand compared to the supply of office and industrial space resulting from downsizing of leased space for existing tenants  the lack of new business growth  and the tendency of existing businesses to hold off on growth plans until the economy improves 
these effects were somewhat mitigated by the company recognizing million and million of lease termination fees in and  respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company s estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
the company has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures the company has equity interests ranging from in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
the company consolidates those joint ventures that it controls through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
the company uses the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where the company does not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  the assets and liabilities of joint ventures for which the company uses the equity method are not included on the company s balance sheet 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
the following discusses the significant categories of costs incurred by the company within the rental operations of the company  direct and indirect costs are capitalized under the guidelines of fasb  accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects fasb and interest costs are capitalized under the guidelines of fasb  capitalization of interest cost fasb 
the company capitalizes these project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
the company believes the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize costs is based upon the company s average borrowing rate on existing debt 
in addition  the company capitalizes costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
the company ceases capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains a occupancy 
the company follows guidelines in fasb and fasb in determining the capitalization of project costs during the lease up period of a property and believes that this treatment is consistent with real estate industry standards for project cost capitalization 
a portion of the direct costs associated with the construction development division and the leasing division  as well as a portion of indirect costs  are capitalized into the cost of specific construction development and leasing projects 
the capitalized portion of these costs is based upon standard charges determined by the company 
the standard charges were established based upon time estimates developed by the company to cover the direct overhead costs of the construction development and leasing divisions and a portion of the remaining indirect overhead of the company 
the company reviews these standards on a quarterly basis to ensure that the amounts capitalized are appropriate 
impairment of real estate investments the company evaluates its real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
the company utilizes the guidelines established under sfas to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  the company reviews the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in its held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  the company assesses other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less cost to sell 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
the company has the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances a tenant watch list as well as a list of the largest tenants based upon annual gross rent is maintained and monitored for tenants with potential risk  and the company has a defined accounting policy to reserve for the entire tenant receivable balance of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
revenue recognition on long term construction contracts the company recognizes income on long term construction contracts where the company serves as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of the company s estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon the company s estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risk relating to profit and cost estimates that is reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regards to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact to the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by the company 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity the company expects to meet liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining the company s current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  and net cash provided by operating activities 
the company expects to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  through the following issuance of additional unsecured notes  undistributed cash available for distribution  if any  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
rental operations the company believes that its principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
the company believes that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
the company is subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
however  management believes that these risks are mitigated by the company s strong market presence in most of its locations and the fact that the company performs in house credit review and analysis on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
credit facilities the company has the following lines of credit available in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date interest rate amount outstanding at december unsecured line of credit february libor

from time to time  the company expects to issue additional securities under these registration statements to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facilities and other long term debt upon maturity 
the indenture governing the company s unsecured notes also requires the company to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding the operations of the company 
the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants and expects to remain in compliance in the foreseeable future 
in january  the company completed an issuance of unsecured debt totaling million bearing interest at  due sale of real estate assets the company utilizes sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity 
during and  the company engaged in a capital recycling program that resulted in sales of over billion of real estate assets during these two years 
in  this program was substantially reduced as capital needs were met through other sources and the slower business climate provided fewer opportunities to profitably reinvest sale proceeds 
the company continues to pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets when beneficial to the long term strategy of the company 
uses of liquidity the company s principal uses of liquidity include the following property investments and recurring leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  and the company s common stock repurchase program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
the fair values of the company s debt instruments are calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved

as a result  the company s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the company s hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
in december  the company entered into two million forward starting interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the swaps was a liability of million as of december  see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for further information
