overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of mid sized investment management firms our affiliates 
as of december   our affiliated investment management firms managed approximately billion in assets across a broad range of investment styles and in three principal distribution channels high net worth  mutual fund and institutional 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing businesses across these three channels  in addition to investments in mid sized investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we provide more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles and in our three principal distribution channels 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
affiliate clients in the high net worth distribution channel include high net worth and affluent individuals  family trusts and managed accounts at brokerage firms and other sponsors that are attributable to individuals 
through our affiliates  we provide customized investment management services for high net worth individuals and families through direct relationships  as well as through more than managed account programs 
our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to domestic and offshore mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisers  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 
through our affiliates  we offer investment products across more than different investment styles in the institutional distribution channel  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value and growth equity 
through this distribution channel  we manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities and taft hartley plans 
while we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  we strive to maintain each affiliate s entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
our principal investment structure involves the ownership of a majority interest in our affiliates  with each affiliate organized as a separate firm 
each affiliate operating agreement is tailored to meet that affiliate s particular characteristics and provides us the authority to cause or prevent certain actions to protect our interests 
we have revenue sharing arrangements with most of our affiliates 
under these arrangements  a percentage of revenue or in certain cases different percentages relating to the various sources or amounts of revenue of a particular affiliate is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the remaining portion of the affiliate s revenue is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us  and called the owners allocation 
each affiliate distributes its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate although  as discussed below  in certain circumstances we may permit an affiliate s management to use its portion of the owners allocation to meet the affiliate s operating expenses 
we only agree to a particular revenue sharing arrangement if we believe that the operating allocation will cover operating expenses of the affiliate  including a potential increase in expenses or decrease in revenue without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses 
to the extent that we are unable to anticipate changes in the revenue and expense base of an affiliate  the agreed upon operating allocation may not be large enough to pay for all of the affiliate s operating expenses 
the allocations and distributions of cash to us under the owners allocation generally have priority over the allocations and distributions to the affiliate s managers  which help to protect us if there are any expenses in excess of the operating allocation of the affiliate 
thus  if an affiliate s expenses exceed its operating allocation  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  and then reduce the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
nevertheless  we may agree to adjustments to revenue sharing arrangements to accommodate our business needs or those of our affiliates  including deferring or forgoing the receipt of some portion or all of our share of an affiliate s revenue to permit the affiliate to fund operating expenses or restructuring our relationship with an affiliate  if we believe that doing so will maximize the long term benefits to us 
in addition  a revenue sharing arrangement may be modified to a profit based arrangement as described below to better accommodate our business needs or those of our affiliates 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from the operating allocation and their distributions from the owners allocation  and to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation which is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
an affiliate s managers therefore have incentives to increase revenue thereby increasing the operating allocation and their share of the owners allocation and to control expenses thereby increasing the amount of operating allocation available for their compensation 
some of our affiliates are not subject to a revenue sharing arrangement  but instead operate on a profit based model similar to a wholly owned subsidiary 
in our profit based affiliates  we participate in a budgeting process with the affiliate and receive as cash flow a share of its profits 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in those cases  we generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
currently  our profit based affiliates account for less than of our ebitda 
net income on our income statement reflects the consolidation of substantially all of the revenue of our affiliates  reduced by the operating expenses of our affiliates  our operating expenses ie  our holding company expenses  including interest  amortization and income taxes  and the profits allocated to our affiliates management owners referred to on our income statement as minority interest 
as discussed above  for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  the receipt of owners allocation at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of expenses incurred for holding company operations  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
for example  most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance  and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  in the high net worth and institutional distribution channels  certain clients are billed on the basis of investment performance performance fees 
performance fees are inherently dependent on investment results  and therefore may vary substantially from year to year 
principally  our assets under management are directly managed by our affiliates 
one of our affiliates also manages assets in the institutional distribution channel using an overlay strategy 
overlay assets assets managed subject to strategies which employ futures  options or other derivative securities generate asset based fees that are typically substantially lower than the asset based fees generated by our affiliates other investment strategies 
therefore  changes in directly managed assets generally have a greater impact on our revenue from asset based fees than changes in total assets under management a figure which includes overlay assets 
in addition to the revenue derived from providing investment management services  we derive a small portion of our revenue from transaction based brokerage fees and distribution fees at certain affiliates 
in the case of the transaction based brokerage business at third avenue management llc third avenue  our percentage participation in third avenue s brokerage fee revenue is substantially less than our percentage participation in the investment management fee revenue realized by third avenue and our other affiliates 
for this reason  increases or decreases in our consolidated revenue that are attributable to third avenue brokerage fees will not affect our net income and ebitda in the same manner as investment management services revenue from third avenue and our other affiliates 
results of operations the following tables present our affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this report and a statement of changes for each period 
assets under management operating segment at december  dollars in billions high net worth mutual fund institutional directly managed assets percent of total overlay assets percent of total assets under management statement of changes year ended december  dollars in billions beginning of period new investments sale of affiliate equity investment net client cash flows directly managed assets net client cash flows overlay assets investment performance end of period we closed new affiliate investments in third avenue in the third quarter of  friess associates  llc friess and welch forbes llc welch forbes in the fourth quarter of and frontier capital management company  llc in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we sold our minority equity investment in paradigm asset management  llc our assets under management at the end of were billion  lower than at the end of the decrease in assets under management was primarily attributable to the broad decline in the equity markets during  a decline that was partially offset by the closing of our investment in third avenue in the third quarter of the operating segment analysis presented in the table below is based on average assets under management 
for the high net worth and institutional distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets under management at the end of each calendar quarter 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represents an average of the daily net assets for the year 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue 
in millions  except as noted change change average assets under management in billions high net worth mutual fund institutional total revenue high net worth mutual fund institutional total net income high net worth mutual fund institutional total ebitda high net worth mutual fund institutional total assets under management attributable to investments that closed during the relevant periods are included on a weighted average basis for the period from the closing date of the investments 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources below 
we believe ebitda is useful as an indicator of cash flow generated by each of our operating segments 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the following factors our assets under management including increases or decreases relating to new investments  net client cash flows or changes in the value of assets that are attributable to fluctuations in the equity markets  the portion of our assets across the three operating segments and our affiliates  which realize different fee rates  the portion of our directly managed and overlay assets  which realize different fee rates  the recognition of any performance fees charged by certain affiliates  and the level of transaction based brokerage fees 
in addition  the billing patterns of our affiliates will have an impact on revenue in cases of rising or falling markets 
as described previously  advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period  while advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
as a consequence  when equity market declines result in decreased assets under management in a particular period  revenue reported on accounts that are billed in advance of that period may appear to have a relatively higher quarterly fee rate 
our revenue increased in from  following an decrease in revenue in from the increase in revenue in was primarily a result of our investments in friess and welch forbes in the fourth quarter of  and third avenue in the third quarter of further contributing to the growth in revenue  though to a lesser extent  were higher performance fees in as compared to these increases were partially offset by the decline in assets under management at existing affiliates which  in turn  was primarily a result of the broad decline in the equity markets during the decrease in revenue in resulted primarily from declines in directly managed assets attributable to declines in the value of assets under management  which resulted principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
these declines were partially offset by revenue generated by positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and from our investments in new affiliates 
the following discusses the changes in our revenue by operating segments 
high net worth distribution channel the increase in revenue of in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted primarily from our investments in welch forbes in the fourth quarter of  third avenue in the third quarter of and  to a lesser extent  friess in the fourth quarter of the increase in revenue from these investments was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management  resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  revenue also increased because of a proportional shift in assets under management within this distribution channel to accounts that realize higher fees which shift principally resulted from our new investments and  to a lesser extent  because of the effects of advance billing as previously discussed  which is the primary billing method used in the high net worth distribution channel 
the decrease in revenue of in the high net worth distribution channel in from resulted from a decline in performance fees and a shift in assets under management within this distribution channel to client relationships that realize lower fee rates  and was partially offset by the increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of in was primarily attributable to positive net client cash flows and our investment in welch forbes  and was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
mutual fund distribution channel the increase in revenue of in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of in was primarily attributable to our investments in friess in the fourth quarter of and third avenue in the third quarter of and to positive net client cash flows  and was partially offset by a decline in assets under management resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth of average assets under management because of an increase in assets under management in mutual funds that realize lower fees  principally a result of the investments in friess and third avenue 
the increase in revenue of in the mutual fund distribution channel in from resulted principally from an increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management of in was primarily attributable to positive net client cash flows from directly managed assets and our investment in friess and was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
institutional distribution channel the increase in revenue of in the institutional distribution channel in from resulted from our investments in friess and third avenue and an increase in performance fees 
this increase in revenue was partially offset by a decline in average assets under management  resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
unrelated to the change in assets under management  revenue also increased because of a shift in assets under management within this distribution channel to accounts that realize higher fees  principally as a result of our investment in friess and net client cash outflows from overlay assets 
the decrease in revenue of in the institutional distribution channel in from resulted from the decrease in average assets under management  and in particular from the decrease in our directly managed assets 
the decrease in average assets under management of in was primarily attributable to net client cash outflows from directly managed and overlay assets  as well as a decline in average assets under management resulting principally from a broad decline in the equity markets 
operating expenses a substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  and a substantial majority of affiliate expenses is incurred at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation generally determines its operating expenses  and therefore our consolidated operating expenses are generally impacted by increases or decreases in affiliate revenue and corresponding increases or decreases in our affiliates operating allocations 
similarly  our consolidated compensation and related expenses generally increase or decrease in proportion to increases or decreases in revenue 
in the case of profit based affiliates  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the expenses of such affiliates 
the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses 
dollars in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses compensation and related expenses increased in  following a decrease in the increase in resulted principally from an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses resulting from our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue 
the increase in compensation expense in was also from investment spending for distribution initiatives and increased holding company compensation 
aggregate increases in compensation expenses in were partially offset by compensation expense reductions at certain affiliates that were greater than the proportionate decrease in revenue at such affiliates 
the decrease in compensation and related expenses in was primarily a result of the relationship of revenue and operating expenses at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced declines in revenue and  accordingly  reported lower compensation 
the decrease in compensation expense in was also attributable to lower holding company compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was principally attributable to our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue  and was partially offset by a decrease in sub advisory and distribution expenses at the managers funds llc managers resulting from a decrease in its assets under management 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was principally attributable to increases in spending by our affiliates from their operating allocations  and an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses resulting from our investments in friess and welch forbes 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets of in resulted from our adoption of financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer amortized 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in amortization as a result of our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue 
the increase in amortization of intangible assets of in resulted from our purchase of additional interests in existing affiliates and  to a lesser extent  our investments in friess and welch forbes 
depreciation and other amortization expenses increased in and in the increase in was principally attributable to the incremental depreciation associated with our investments in friess and welch forbes and other fixed asset purchases at the holding company and affiliates 
the increase in was principally related to fixed asset purchases at the holding company and affiliates 
other operating expenses increased in and in the increase in was principally attributable to the incremental expenses associated with our investments in friess and welch forbes and increased spending from the operating allocation at affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
the increase in was principally related to increased spending from the operating allocation at affiliates with revenue sharing agreements 
other income statement data the following table summarizes other income statement data 
dollars in millions change change minority interest income tax expense interest expense investment and other income minority interest increased in  following a decrease in the increase in minority interest in resulted principally from the previously discussed increase in revenue in this increase was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because of our investment in friess  in which we currently own of this firm s owners allocation  representing a relatively lower percentage ownership than our other affiliate investments 
the decrease in minority interest in resulted from the previously discussed decline in revenue in  and was partially offset by the growth in revenue at affiliates in which we own relatively lower percentages of owners allocation 
the increase in income taxes in was attributable to the increase in income before taxes  as our effective tax rate did not change over the prior year 
the decrease in income taxes in was attributable to the decrease in income before taxes  and to a decrease in our effective tax rate from to 
our effective tax rate decreased in as a result of a reduction in state taxes which resulted from the addition of affiliates in lower tax rate jurisdictions and our implementation of an incentive compensation plan that limited certain non deductible expenses 
interest expense increased in following a decrease in the increase in interest expense in resulted principally from our issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities in december and january  on which we pay interest at the annual rate of 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in weighted average debt outstanding on our senior revolving credit facility and decreased interest expense associated with lower reported amortization of our transition adjustment under financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  which is discussed below in recent accounting developments 
the decrease in interest expense in resulted principally from the restructuring of our long term debt to effect lower costs of borrowing and a decrease in the effective interest rate of our senior revolving credit facility 
in may  we completed the private placement of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes accreting at a rate of per year  and used million of the net proceeds of approximately million to repay debt under our credit facility 
the decrease in the effective interest rate of our senior revolving credit facility was the result of a decrease in libor rates 
the decrease in interest expense in was partially offset by million of amortization of debt issuance costs on the zero coupon senior convertible notes and expenses of million related to our fas transition adjustment 
investment and other income decreased in  following a increase in the decrease in was attributable to the maintenance of lower levels of excess cash at the holding company as a result of our investments in friess and welch forbes in the fourth quarter of and third avenue in the third quarter of the increase in investment and other income in was attributable to the maintenance of higher levels of excess cash as a result of the sale of zero coupon senior convertible notes described above 
net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years dollars in millions change change net income net income for reflects changes in the accounting for intangible assets as a result of the implementation of fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of  and therefore is not directly comparable to the operating results presented for and note to our consolidated financial statements presents our net income for and as though we had adopted fas on january  and january   respectively 
the increase in net income in resulted principally from the increases in revenue described above and lower reported amortization expense as a result of our adoption of fas these factors were partially offset by the increases in operating expenses other than our amortization expense  interest expense and minority interest expense  as described above 
the decrease in net income in resulted principally from decreases in revenue and corresponding decreases in operating expenses and minority interest expense as described above  offset partially by an increase in investment and other income  also described above 
supplemental performance measure as supplemental information  we provide a non gaap performance measure that we refer to as cash net income 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
cash net income is defined as net income plus the non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
we consider cash net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents the performance of our investment management operations before non cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in our affiliated investment management firms 
since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse as discussed below in greater detail  we add back these non cash expenses 
cash net income is used by our management and board of directors as a principal performance benchmark  including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
our measure of cash net income was modified to include certain deferred taxes in response to our adoption of fas on january  deferred tax expenses are accrued because intangible assets are amortized over different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes since we structure our investments as taxable transactions  and since our cash taxes are reduced by amortization deductions over the periods prescribed by tax laws 
while fas eliminated the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets  it continues to require the accrual of deferred tax expenses for these assets 
since nearly all our deferred tax expenses would reverse only in the event of a future sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  we believe deferred tax accruals should be added back in calculating cash net income to best reflect the performance of our investment management operations before non cash expenses 
accordingly  since january  we have defined cash net income as net income plus depreciation  amortization and deferred taxes 
for periods prior to and our adoption of fas  we defined cash net income as net income plus depreciation and amortization  and results for such periods are presented on that basis in this report 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash net income to net income for each of the past three years 
dollars in millions net income depreciation amortization deferred taxes cash net income as described above  cash net income for reflects the change to our definition of cash net income that resulted from the implementation of fas in the first quarter of  and therefore is not directly comparable to the operating results presented for and if we had adopted fas on january  or january  and our definition of cash net income had been modified accordingly  cash net income for and would have been million and million  respectively 
cash net income increased in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income and related changes in the accounting for intangible assets resulting from our adoption of fas in  cash net income decreased primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income  excluding the changes in depreciation and amortization during these periods 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources as of december in the years indicated below dollars in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt zero coupon convertible debt mandatory convertible debt cash flow data operating cash flow investing cash flow financing cash flow ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page we have met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  the issuance of convertible debt securities and equity and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
for  the principal use of cash was to make investments in new affiliates  make distributions to affiliate managers  repay indebtedness  pay income taxes  repurchase shares of our common stock  make additional investments in existing affiliates including our purchase of affiliate managers retained equity and for working capital purposes 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for additional investments  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  additional investments in existing affiliates including our purchase of affiliate managers retained equity  the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes 
in august  we replaced our former senior revolving credit facility with a new senior revolving credit facility the facility with several major commercial banks 
the facility  which is scheduled to mature in august  currently provides that we may borrow up to million at rates of interest based either on the eurodollar rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time that vary depending on our credit ratings 
subject to the agreement of the lenders or prospective lenders to increase commitments  we have the option to increase the facility to million 
the facility contains financial covenants with respect to net worth  leverage and interest coverage  and requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee on any unused portion 
the facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations of indebtedness  liens  dividends and fundamental corporate changes 
all borrowings under the facility are collateralized by pledges of all capital stock or other equity interests owned by us 
we have a cash management program that enables our affiliates to invest their excess cash with us to achieve a competitive rate of return 
at december   our affiliates had invested million with us in this program 
as these investments represent intercompany loans  they are eliminated for accounting purposes and are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in may  we completed the private placement of zero coupon senior convertible notes in which we sold a total of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due  accreting at a rate of per annum 
each  zero coupon senior convertible note is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events i if the closing price of a share of our common stock exceeds specified levels for specified periods  ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s is below bb  iii if we call the securities for redemption  or iv if we take certain corporate actions 
we have the option to redeem the securities for cash on or after may   and the holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value on may of   and the purchase price for such repurchases may be paid in cash or shares of our common stock 
it is our current intention to repurchase the securities with cash 
subsequent to december   we repurchased million principal amount at maturity of these notes in privately negotiated transactions 
if our common stock continues to trade at or near current market prices  we anticipate that some or all of the outstanding securities may be redeemed by investors at their book value for cash in may in december  we completed a public offering of million of mandatory convertible debt securities 
a sale of an over allotment of the securities was completed in january  increasing the amount outstanding to million 
the securities initially consist of i a senior note due november  with a principal amount of on which we pay interest quarterly at the annual rate of  and ii a forward purchase contract pursuant to which the holder has agreed to purchase  for per contract  shares of our common stock on november   with the number of shares to be determined based upon the average trading price of our common stock for a period preceding that date 
depending on the average trading price in that period  the number of shares of common stock to be issued in the settlement of the contracts will range from  to  each of the senior notes is pledged to us to collateralize the holder s obligations under the forward purchase contracts 
beginning in  the senior notes will be remarketed to new investors 
if successful  the remarketing will generate million of proceeds to be used by the original holders of the securities to honor their obligations on the forward purchase contracts 
in exchange for the additional million in payment on the forward purchase contracts  we will issue shares of our common stock 
the senior notes will remain outstanding until november and assuming a successful remarketing will be held by the new investors 
in anticipation of a possible repurchase of the outstanding zero coupon senior convertible notes  we completed a private placement of million of floating rate senior convertible securities in february these securities bear interest at a rate equal to month libor minus  payable in cash quarterly 
each  floating rate senior convertible security is convertible into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of any of the following events i if the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange exceeds per share over certain periods  ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s is below bb  iii if we exercise our option to call the convertible securities for redemption  or iv in the event that we take certain corporate actions 
upon conversion  the holders will receive shares of our common stock for each  floating rate senior convertible security 
in addition  if at the time of conversion the market price of our common stock exceeds per share  holders will receive additional shares of our common stock based on the price of our common stock at the time of the conversion 
we may redeem the floating rate senior convertible securities for cash at any time on or after february   at their principal amount 
the holders of the convertible securities may require us to repurchase such securities on february of    and  at their principal amount 
we may choose to pay the purchase price for such repurchases in cash or shares of our common stock 
it is our current intention to repurchase these securities with cash 
the floating rate senior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations 
these regulations require us to deduct interest expense at the rate at which we would issue a non contingent  non convertible  fixed rate debt instrument 
when the implied interest rate for tax purposes is greater than the actual interest rate  a deferred tax expense is generated 
whereas the implied interest rate for these securities for tax purposes is  the actual rate is three month libor minus as of march   this rate equaled 
based on current libor rates  we believe our issuance of these securities will increase our deferred taxes by approximately million per year 
while these deferred tax liabilities may never reverse  all will reverse if  on the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the securities or later  the securities are redeemed  and if our common stock is trading at per share or less 
all deferred taxes will be reclassified to equity if the securities convert and our common stock is trading at more than per share when it is delivered to holders 
a portion of the net proceeds received on the sale of the floating rate senior convertible securities was used to repurchase million of our common stock and million principal amount at maturity of the zero coupon senior convertible notes  as described above 
the following table provides updated unaudited balance sheet data as of march  dollars in millions holding company cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt zero coupon convertible debt mandatory convertible debt floating rate convertible debt at march   balances outstanding under our affiliate cash management program totaled million 
our obligations to purchase additional equity in our affiliates extend over the next years 
these payment obligations will occur at varying times and in varying amounts over that period  and the actual timing and amounts of such obligations cannot be predicted with any certainty 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such obligations  assuming that all such obligations had become due as of december   the aggregate amount of these obligations would have totaled approximately million 
assuming the closing of such additional purchases  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized basis as of december  in order to provide the funds necessary for us to meet such obligations and for us to continue to acquire interests in investment management firms  it may be necessary for us to incur  from time to time  additional debt and or to issue equity or debt securities  depending on market and other conditions 
these potential obligations  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations  and therefore  we may need to raise capital by making additional borrowings or by selling shares of our stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these obligations 
operating cash flow the increase in cash flow from operations in resulted from an increase in operating income which resulted from our revenue growth exceeding increases in operating expenses  an increase in our deferred income tax provision attributable to tax benefits acquired in our investments in friess  welch forbes and third avenue and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily attributable to timing differences of compensation payments and our investment in third avenue 
supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information in this report  we have provided information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operations 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to cash flow from operations for the last three years dollars in millions cash flow from operations interest expense  net current tax provision increase decrease in minority interest increase decrease in other assets and liabilities ebitda investing cash flow changes in net cash flow from investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we closed our investment in third avenue using working capital and borrowings under the facility 
in  we also made payments to acquire interests in existing affiliates 
during  we also terminated our employee loan program  and all loans under that program were repaid 
financing cash flow the decrease in net cash flow from financing activities in and the increase in were attributable to our issuance of the zero coupon senior convertible notes and the mandatory convertible debt securities in the principal sources of cash from financing activities over the last three years have been issuances of convertible debt securities and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
our uses of cash from financing activities during were for the repayment of debt and for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share under our share repurchase program 
our share repurchase program was authorized by the board of directors in april  permitting us to repurchase up to of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
in july  our board of directors approved an increase to the existing share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to an additional of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
the timing and amount of purchases are determined at the discretion of our management 
from january  through march   we repurchased  shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program 
at march   a total of  shares of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the program 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt leases purchases of affiliate equity other liabilities long term debt reflects the principal payments on the zero coupon senior convertible notes and mandatory convertible debt securities  each described above 
after december   we repurchased million of principal amount at maturity of the zero coupon senior convertible notes in privately negotiated transactions 
purchases of affiliate equity reflect estimates of our obligations to purchase additional equity in our affiliates 
as described previously  these payment obligations will occur in varying amounts over the next years  and the actual timing and amounts of such obligations cannot be predicted with any certainty 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such obligations  assuming that all such obligations had become due as of december   the aggregate amount of these obligations would have totaled approximately million 
assuming the closing of such additional purchases  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized basis as of december  unlike other purchase obligations  the timing of which is uncertain  in the case of our investment in friess we are scheduled to purchase of the firm in the fourth quarter of  for an amount to be determined based on a multiple of owners allocation at the time of the purchase  which is intended to approximate fair value 
other liabilities reflect notes payable to affiliate management partners that were issued in connection with our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
interest rate sensitivity our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the values of assets managed 
such values are affected by changes in the broader financial markets which are  in part  affected by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
with respect to any debt financing  we may be exposed to potential fluctuations in the amount of interest expense resulting from changing interest rates 
we may seek to offset such interest rate exposure in part by entering into hedging contracts 
market risk in the past we have used interest rate derivative contracts to manage market exposures associated with our variable rate debt by creating offsetting market exposure 
during february  we became a party to million notional amount of interest rate swap contracts 
in february  we closed million notional amount of these contracts and entered into a new million notional amount contract  which was subsequently closed in june in december our remaining million notional amount interest rate swap contract expired 
although we don t currently have any interest rate swap contracts in place  we may enter into such contracts  or engage in similar hedging activities  in the future 
in using these derivative instruments  we face certain risks that are not directly related to market movements including  but not limited to  credit risk 
credit risk  or the risk of loss arising from a counterparty s failure or inability to meet payment or performance terms of a contract  is a particularly significant element of an interest rate swap contract 
we attempt to control this risk through analysis of our counterparties and ongoing examinations of outstanding payments and delinquencies 
there can be no assurance that we will use such derivative contracts in the future or that the amount of coverage we might obtain will cover all of our indebtedness outstanding at any such time 
therefore  there can be no assurance that any possible derivative contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense 
recent accounting developments in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses reporting and disclosure requirements for variable interest entities vies 
fin defines a vie as an entity that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
it also requires additional disclosures for an enterprise that holds a significant variable interest in a vie  but is not the primary beneficiary 
the consolidation and disclosure provisions of fin are effective immediately for vies created after january   and for reporting periods beginning after june  for vies created before february  fin also requires interim disclosures in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of the date on which the vie was created  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when fin becomes effective 
while we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition  we may be required to consolidate the building and financing of our corporate headquarters  which is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
fas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation when companies elect to expense stock options at fair value at the time of grant 
as we currently follow the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the transition provision of fas will not apply to us 
fas also requires additional interim disclosure for all companies with stock based employee compensation 
the interim disclosure requirements are effective for periods that begin after december  we will provide the required disclosure in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for companies that issue certain guarantees 
under fin  we are required to recognize a liability for the fair value of all guarantees entered into or modified after december   even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
fin also requires enhanced disclosures for guarantees existing at december  the impact of the adoption of fin on our reported operating results and financial position is not expected to be material 
in october  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas establishes new rules for the recognition and measurement of asset impairment as well as the reporting of disposals of a business segment and the recognition of losses from the discontinuation of operations 
our adoption of fas on january  did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standard no 
fas  business combinations  and fas goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas limits the method of accounting for business combinations to the purchase method and establishes new criteria for the recognition of other intangible assets 
fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted fas on july  and fas on january  note to our consolidated financial statements presents our net income for and as though we had adopted fas on january  and january   respectively 
in  the fasb deferred the effective date of fas to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted fas on january  and reported a million transition adjustment  which was reclassified into earnings in and the transition adjustment became fully amortized in critical accounting policies revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
while most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly  some are billed before services are rendered in advance and others are billed after services are rendered in arrears 
in each case  revenue is recognized as the services are rendered 
any fees billed in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of service 
unlike asset based fees  which are calculated based upon a contractual percentage of a client s assets under management  performance based fees are generally assessed as a percentage of the investment performance realized on a client s account in a quarterly or annual period 
performance based fees are recognized in the quarter in which the fee becomes billable 
intangible assets in allocating the purchase price of our acquisitions and assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of each asset and  where applicable  its useful life 
in this analysis  we estimate future cash flows and remaining lives of certain assets 
additionally  we utilize assumptions concerning valuation multiples  client attrition  tax benefits and discount rates in our valuations 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
at december   the carrying amount of our intangible assets is as follows dollars in billions goodwill other intangible assets definite lived other intangible assets indefinite lived we test the carrying amount of each of our intangible assets at least once a year 
we test goodwill for each of our operating segments by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to its fair value 
similarly  we test each of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which represent captive mutual fund contracts  by comparing their carrying amounts to their related fair value 
we test our definite lived intangible assets by comparing their carrying amounts to the remaining projected undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
deferred taxes deferred taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
historically  our deferred taxes have been comprised primarily of deferred tax liabilities attributable to intangible assets and deferred tax assets from state credits and loss carryforwards 
in measuring the amount of our deferred taxes each period  we must project the impact on our future tax payments of any reversal of deferred tax liabilities which would increase our tax payments  and any use of our state credits and carryforwards which would decrease our tax payments 
in forming these estimates  we make assumptions about future federal and state income tax rates and the apportionment of future taxable income to states in which we have operations 
an increase or decrease in federal or state income tax rates could have a material impact on our deferred income tax liabilities and assets and would result in a current income tax charge or benefit 
for example  a increase to our projected average tax rate would increase our deferred tax liabilities and income tax expense by million 
in the case of our deferred tax assets  we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances  which would reduce these assets to their recoverable amounts 
in forming these estimates  we make assumptions of future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that these assets will be realized  we record an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be unable to realize additional amounts of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expense in the period such determination was made 
for example  if we were to make an investment in a new affiliate located in a state where we have operating loss carryforwards  the projected taxable income from the new affiliate could be offset by these operating loss carryforwards  justifying a reduction to the valuation allowance 
headquarters lease in  we entered into a lease agreement with an owner lessor entity lessor to finance the construction of our corporate headquarters building in prides crossing  massachusetts the building 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for leases and related interpretations  the building and the related financing obligations of the lessor are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
as previously discussed  in january the fasb released fin  which upon its effectiveness in the third quarter of will require the consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
as a result  if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary  we would be required to consolidate the building and its related financing approximately million  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding 
diluted eps is similar to basic eps  but adjusts for the effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of our common stock including  but not limited to  stock options or convertible bonds 
diluted eps does not include approximately million shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of the outstanding zero coupon senior convertible notes because of a contingent conversion feature  which provides for conversion in certain limited circumstances 
economic and market conditions the asset management industry is an important segment of the financial services industry in north america and has been a key driver of growth in financial services over the last decade 
as of the end of the most recently compiled industry data  the assets under management across our principal distribution channels totaled more than trillion 
while the aggregate value of assets managed by the industry has been reduced by equity market declines since that time  we believe prospects for overall industry growth estimated by one industry consultant to increase at a rate of annually over the next five years remain strong 
we expect that this growth will be driven by market related increases in assets under management  broad demographic trends and wealth creation related to growth in gross domestic product  and will be experienced in varying degrees across all three of the principal distribution channels for our affiliates products high net worth  mutual fund and institutional 
in the high net worth distribution channel comprised of high net worth and affluent individuals  family trusts and managed accounts  we believe that each of the three factors of market performance  demographics and gross domestic product growth will lead to asset growth 
high net worth individuals those having more than million in investable assets represent the primary component of this distribution channel 
at the end of  there were an estimated million high net worth individuals  with aggregate assets of trillion 
one recent industry report forecasts this asset base to grow to a total of trillion by the end of  an annual growth rate of 
we also expect that assets in the high net worth distribution channel will grow as a result of recent innovations in product development and distribution that allow a growing number of affluent investors access to managed account products at lower investment levels than has been traditionally available 
in the mutual fund distribution channel  the investment company institute reports that more than million individuals in almost million households in the united states are invested in mutual funds  representing a penetration level in us households with more than  in investable assets 
in  net inflows to mutual funds excluding money market funds totaled approximately billion 
despite positive flows  aggregate mutual fund assets declined from trillion at the end of to trillion at the end of  principally as a result of market declines 
we anticipate that inflows to mutual funds will continue and that aggregate mutual fund assets  particularly those in equity mutual funds  will increase in line with longer term market growth 
the substantial majority of assets in the institutional distribution channel are in retirement plans  and  to a lesser extent  endowments and foundations 
recent industry data indicates that aggregate pension assets totaled nearly trillion at the end of while growth in institutional retirement plans has slowed in recent years  we anticipate that the combination of an aging work force  higher funding levels to pension plans that are deemed under funded and longer term market growth should contribute to the ongoing strength of this distribution channel 
international operations first quadrant limited  an affiliate of first quadrant  lp  is organized and headquartered outside of london  england 
tweedy  browne company llc  which is based in new york  maintains a research office in london 
dfd select group  sarl  a subsidiary of dfd select group  sarl in which we own a minority interest  is organized and headquartered in paris  france 
in the future  we may invest in other investment management firms which are located and or conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
