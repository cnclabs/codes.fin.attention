the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the estimated carrying value of long lived assets  including goodwill and property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset is recognized when the expected future operating cash flows to be derived from the asset are less than its carrying value 
in addition  the company s evaluation considers non financial data such as market trends  product and development cycles  and changes in management s market emphasis 
during and  the company recognized asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  primarily related to equipment with carrying value above their estimated fair market value 
revenue recognition revenues consist primarily of managed ip networks  managed hosting and internet access service fees  which are fixed monthly amounts  and are recognized in the financial statements when earned during the life of the contract 
for all periods  any services billed and payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are earned 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the effect of implementation of sab was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of installation and equipment costs deferred in accordance with sab are recorded on the balance sheet in other assets 
such costs are recognized on a straight line basis over periods of up to months  the estimated period over which the related revenues from installation and equipment sales are deferred and recognized 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable 
the company periodically reviews the credit quality of its customers and generally does not require collateral 
data communications costs in the ordinary course of business  invoices from our communications service providers may exceed the services we have actually taken from them or we may have other commercial disputes concerning such invoices 
our practice is to identify these variances and engage in discussions with the vendors to resolve the differences 
we maintain accruals for our best estimate of the difference between what we have previously paid the vendor and the amount that will ultimately be paid to them 
purchased communications services is our largest cost item  variations in this accrual may have a material impact on our results of operations

the company also agreed not to pursue the collection of million of pre petition receivables owed to it by bridge and to assign to bridge any claims it had against other bridge entities with the exception of bridge canada where the company retained its right to receive a pro rata distribution of assets from the liquidation of bridge canada 
all amounts due under the settlement agreement were paid in march revenue the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of managed ip  managed hosting and internet access services 
for the years and  revenue from related parties bridge and reuters represented approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we expect our revenues from related parties to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues as we expand our managed ip  internet access and hosting customer base 
we charge each customer an initial installation fee that typically equals one month s revenue and a fixed monthly fee that varies depending on the services provided  the bandwidth used and the quality of service level chosen 
our customer agreements are typically for to months in length 
these fees are recognized in income over the average life of the customer contracts 
prices for telecommunication services  including the services we offer  have decreased significantly over the past several years and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future

data communications and operations expenses include the cost of leasing local access lines to connect customers to our points of presence pops  leasing backbone circuits to interconnect our pops  salaries and related benefits for engineering and operations personnel who maintain our network  monitor network performance  resolve service faults  and install new sites  leasing connections to other internet service providers  other related repairs and maintenance items  and leasing routers  switches and hosting space 
data communications and operations expense decreased significantly as we negotiated unit price reductions with our vendors 
we expect that these costs will rise in total dollars as we increase our customer base  but we expect a decrease as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
these expenses include the cost of sales and marketing salaries and related benefits  product management  pricing and support  sales commissions and referral payments  and advertising  direct marketing and trade shows 
we anticipate that these expenses will continue to increase in total dollars as we add more sales personnel and increase our marketing initiatives to support the expansion of our customer base

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of the depreciation and amortization of communications equipment  capital leases  goodwill and intangibles 
we expect these expenses to decrease as a portion of our fixed assets fully depreciate in generally  depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the useful life of the associated asset  which ranges from three to five years 
our data center assets are generally depreciated over years 
amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles ceased at the end of as prescribed by sfas no

in  the company also refinanced the majority of its capital lease liability 
although we do not pay cash interest until on our capital lease liability with gecc  we expect our interest expense to increase as accrued interest will also bear interest until cash interest payments commence in income tax expense 
we incurred operating losses from inception through december  and  therefore  have not recorded a provision for income taxes in our historical financial statements 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets because the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of december   we had us net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and foreign net operating losses of approximately million 

table of contents an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code  restricts the company s ability to use future us taxable income against the company s us net operating loss carry forward 
section may also limit the utilization of other us carryover tax attributes upon the occurrence of an ownership change 
such an ownership change occurred during as a result of the acquisition of our company by bridge and in as a result of the issuance of million of preferred stock 
management believes that this limitation restricts our ability to offset any future us taxable income against its net operating losses carry forward over the us statutory carry forward periods ranging from to years  to approximately million a year before the net effect of future recognized built in gains or losses existing as of the date of the ownership change 
as we continue to increase our employee base to support our expanded operations and invest in our marketing and sales operations  we expect to incur net losses at least through results of operations the historical financial information included in this form k will not reflect our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows subsequent to the purchase of bridge s network and the commencement of the related agreements is not comparable to prior periods
