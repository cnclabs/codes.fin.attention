item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revision of consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flows have been revised from those originally reported for the years ended december  and to separately reflect the results of discontinued operations for properties that were sold during the year ended december  the revision had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statements of stockholders equity 
the revision had no impact on net income or net income per share of common stock for the years ended december  and see the discussions of discontinued operations in the results of operations section below 
cautionary language the discussions in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of which reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include market valuations of our stock  financial performance and operations of our shopping centers  real estate conditions  execution of shopping center development programs  successful completion of renovations  completion of pending acquisitions  changes in the availability of additional acquisitions  changes in local or national economic conditions  acts of terrorism or war and other risks detailed from time to time in reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable for our current circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  in that they require our most subjective judgments  form the basis for the accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include our estimates of useful lives in calculating depreciation expense on our shopping center properties and the ultimate recoverability  or impairment  of each shopping center asset 
if actual useful lives are different from our estimates this could result in changes to the results of our operations 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of our shopping center properties could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the properties that may not be reflected in the properties current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
overview we receive income primarily from rental revenue from shopping center properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
primarily as a result of our acquisition program  including the acquisition of western properties trust described below  which included interests in shopping centers  the financial data shows increases in total revenue and total expenses from period to period 
during the year ended december   nine non strategic assets were sold 
during the year ended december   eight non strategic assets were sold 
the cash proceeds were used toward the purchase of six shopping center assets in and four shopping center assets in on november   we acquired western properties trust  a california real estate investment trust 
the transaction was a stock for stock exchange whereby western common shares and units were exchanged for newly issued shares of our common stock and operating subsidiary units  based upon a fixed exchange ratio of of a share of our common stock per western share or operating subsidiary unit 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to holders of western common shares 
we are also currently obligated to issue  shares of our common stock upon the exchange of operating subsidiary units held by limited partners of pan pacific pinecreek  lp  formerly western pinecreek  lp  or pay a cash amount  at our discretion 
in connection with this transaction  we assumed  of western s debt obligations 
on november   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with center trust  inc  a maryland corporation 
the transaction  which closed on january   was a stock for stock exchange including assumption of debt whereby each share of center trust common stock was exchanged for newly issued shares of our common stock 
as a result  we issued  shares of our common stock to center trust stockholders and are obligated to issue up to  shares of our common stock to limited partners of ct operating partnership  lp upon the exchange of operating partnership units held by them 
the transaction included interests in shopping centers  two regional malls and two single tenant assets 
we expect that the more significant part of our growth in the next year or two will come from rent increases from the re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of the assets acquired in the center trust acquisition  additional acquisitions and the stabilization of other properties acquired during and results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december rental revenue  which includes base rent and percentage rent  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenue resulted principally from portfolio occupancy increases and re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in and the properties acquired through the western transaction in november recoveries from tenants  which represents reimbursements from tenants for property operating expenses and property taxes  increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from portfolio occupancy increases and re leasing and re tenanting initiatives of six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in and the properties acquired through the western transaction in november in addition  recoveries from tenants increased because recoverable expenses increased 
recoveries from tenants were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted principally from a reduction of interest income on corporate notes receivable as certain notes were repaid in the fourth quarter of and during as well as a reduction in management fees which resulted from an increase in our ownership percentage of certain subsidiary entities 
the decrease also resulted from a reduction in lease termination fee income compared to prior year and an increase in common area maintenance billing adjustments for that were credited back to tenants 
property operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from six property acquisitions in  four property acquisitions in as well as an increase in insurance costs as a result of added coverage 
property taxes increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in property taxes was primarily the result of property tax re assessments on the assets acquired in the western transaction as well as property tax expense for the assets acquired in and depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to additional depreciation expense on tenant improvements  building renovations and pad build out expenditures incurred during and as well as depreciation expense on the assets acquired during and interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the libor component of our borrowing cost under our revolving credit facility over the comparable period in the prior year 
this decrease in our borrowing cost was partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility to finance properties acquired during and interest expense also increased as a result of our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount  of senior notes in april  our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount  of senior notes in june and our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount  of senior notes in december the stated interest rates of  and on the senior note issuances  respectively  are higher than our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility and term credit loan which were paid down with the net proceeds of the notes offerings 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from annual compensation increases during as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gain on sale of real estate totaling  in resulted from the sale of eight non strategic assets during the year ended december  gain on sales of non strategic assets in are reported under discontinued operations

recoveries from tenants were of property operating expenses and property taxes for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the recovery percentage from prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in average portfolio occupancy during as a result of the western acquisition 
in addition  the western lease agreements do not provide for as many costs to be recoverable from tenants as the pan pacific lease agreements 
other income increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase resulted principally from approximately  of interest income on corporate notes receivable related to real estate activities that were acquired as part of the western acquisition 
property operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in property operating expenses was primarily attributable to the and acquisitions  including western 
property taxes increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in property taxes was also primarily the result of the and acquisitions including western 
depreciation and amortization increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the and acquisitions  including western 
interest expense increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the debt obligations assumed upon the acquisition of western and interest expense relating to funds drawn on our revolving credit facility to finance the seven other properties acquired during and interest expense also increased as a result of our issuance of  in aggregate principal amount  of senior notes in april the stated interest rate of on the senior notes is higher than our cost to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility and term credit loan which were paid down with the net proceeds of the notes offering 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the libor component of our borrowing cost under the revolving credit facility and term credit loan over the comparable period in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and benefits and other related expenses resulting from the acquisition of western as well as annual compensation increases during as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gain on sale of real estate totaling  resulted from the sale of eight non strategic assets during the year ended december  discontinued operations for the years ended december  and of  and  respectively  reflect the operating results of the nine non strategic assets that were sold during the year ended december  funds from operations the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april the white paper defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  gaap  excluding gains or losses sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we consider funds from operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses 
we compute funds from operations in accordance with standards established by the white paper 
our computation of funds from operations may  however  differ from the methodology for calculating funds from operations used by other equity reits and  therefore  may not be comparable to these other reits 
funds from operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our profitability  or as an alternative to cash flow from operations computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
the following table presents our funds from operations for the years ended december  net income add depreciation and amortization depreciation on discontinued operations depreciation of unconsolidated entities operating subsidiary minority interests provision for loss on impairment less net gain on sale of real estate depreciation of non real estate corporate assets funds from operations weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding assuming dilution cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions 
this increase was offset by an increase in income from discontinued operations including the gain thereon  a decrease in the change in other assets and a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in acquisitions of and additions to properties  an increase in funds held in escrow pending property acquisitions and an increase in redemption of operating subsidiary units 
these increases were offset by an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate  an increase in collections of notes receivable and a decrease in the issuance of notes receivable 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase primarily resulted from an increase in notes payable proceeds  an increase in line of credit proceeds  an increase in issuance of senior notes  a decrease in repurchase of common shares and an increase in issuance of common shares 
these increases were offset by an increase in line of credit payments and an increase in distributions paid 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in operating income due to property acquisitions including western 
this increase was offset by an increase in accrued interest to note receivable  an increase in other assets and an increase in net gain on sale of real estate 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of an increase in proceeds from sale of real estate  a decrease in costs associated with the acquisition of western and a decrease in other assets  offset by an increase in acquisitions of and additions to properties and an increase in notes receivable

liquidity and capital resources our total market capitalization at december   was approximately  based on the market closing price of our common stock at december  of per share assuming the conversion of  operating subsidiary units to common stock and our debt outstanding of approximately  exclusive of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately at december  our board of directors adopted a policy of limiting our indebtedness to approximately of our total market capitalization 
however  our board of directors may from time to time modify our debt policy in light of current economic or market conditions including but not limited to the relative costs of debt and equity capital  market conditions for debt and equity securities and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  we may increase or decrease our debt to market capitalization ratio beyond the limit described above 
in connection with our acquisition of western in november  we entered into a new financing arrangement including a  revolving credit facility and a  term credit loan 
our revolving credit facility matures in january and our term credit loan was paid in full in july we expect to renegotiate our revolving credit facility and extend its maturity date during at december   we had  available under our revolving credit facility 
at our option  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
at our option  amounts borrowed under our term credit loan bore interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the weighted average interest rate for short term libor contracts under our revolving credit facility at december  was 
we will continue to use our revolving credit facility to take advantage of select acquisition opportunities as well as to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
in april  we issued  of senior notes due april  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term credit loan 
in june  we issued  of senior notes due june  in december  we issued  of senior notes due january  the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we are the managing member of a joint venture  created for the purpose of developing olympic place in walnut creek  california 
the joint venture entered into a construction loan agreement in december to borrow up to  to fund the development 
at december  and december    and  respectively  had been drawn on the construction loan 
at our option  amounts borrowed under the construction loan bear interest at either libor plus or a reference rate 
the loan is secured by the property and is guaranteed by us 
we consolidate this joint venture 
we could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  further  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
we have entered into certain related party transactions with executive officers and affiliates of the company 
we believe that all related party agreements were entered into at arms length 
information on these related party transactions can be found in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we expect to make distributions from net cash provided by operations 
operating cash flows in excess of amounts to be used for distributions will be invested primarily in short term investments such as collateralized securities of the united states government or its agencies  high grade commercial paper and bank deposits or used to pay down outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility  if any 
the following table provides recent historical distribution information quarter ended date declared record date date paid distribution per share march  february  march  april  june  june  june  july  september  september  september  october  december  october  november  november  march  january  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  november  november  december  march  february  february  march  june  may  may  june  september  august  august  september  december  october  november  december  during the fourth quarter of we distributed a special  two month dividend of a share 
this dividend was in connection with the western acquisition  and was paid to our stockholders of record before the merger transaction was closed to address the two month shift in timing for the payment of our normal quarterly dividend in future periods 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our current working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow us to make the distributions necessary to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we also believe that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisition and development  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities and the use of net proceeds from the disposition of non strategic assets 
we also expect to use funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance acquisition and development activities and capital improvements on an interim basis 
off balance sheet arrangements on september   plaza escuela holding  co  llc completed a financing transaction with an initial funding of  bearing interest at  wherein we received a partial payoff of  on our note receivable of  on the plaza escuela property in walnut creek  california 
the remaining balance of our note of  was converted to a non managing member interest in plaza escuela holding co  llc  the entity that owns the property 
our equity position will earn a preferred return of 
in addition  we are entitled to receive of the operating cash flows from the property through november proceeds from the note repayment and cash flow participation will be used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   the balance of the loan was  the loan is secured by the property and is not guaranteed by us 
we account for this joint venture under the equity method 
this unconsolidated debt is one of two off balance sheet financings to which we are a party 
we are a general partner of a joint venture  which owns a medical office building in encinitas  california  north coast health center 
during the second quarter of  the joint venture entered into a loan agreement for  bearing interest at  to purchase the building on the property 
at december   the balance of the loan was  the loan is secured by the property and is not guaranteed by us 
we account for this joint venture under the equity method 
this unconsolidated debt is one of two off balance sheet financings to which we are a party 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities all of our indebtedness is disclosed in our consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
our indebtedness outstanding at december  includes regularly scheduled principal reductions  balloon payments  scheduled senior note redemptions and amounts due on our revolving credit facility and our joint venture construction loan agreement as follows year amount and thereafter the payments due in the year include the balance drawn on our joint venture construction loan agreement at december  of  payments due in the year include the balance drawn on our revolving credit facility at december  of  and senior note redemptions of  payments due in     and include senior note redemptions of      and  respectively 
with regard to the payments noted above  it is likely that we will not have sufficient funds on hand to repay these amounts at maturity 
therefore  we expect to refinance this debt either through additional debt financings secured by individual properties or groups of properties  by unsecured private or public debt offerings or by additional equity offerings 
we have future obligations relating to leases for real estate and office equipment under operating leases expiring at various dates through rental expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
minimum rentals under noncancellable operating leases in effect at december  were as follows and subsequent inflation substantially all of our leases provide for the recovery of real estate taxes and operating expenses we incur 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the consumer price index or other measures and percentage rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be substantially offset by expense reimbursements  contractual rent increases and percentage rent 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  which will be influenced by changes in short term interest rates  and will be sensitive to inflation

fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires guarantors to determine and recognize the fair value of a guarantee at the issuance date 
in addition  fin contains detailed disclosure requirements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we are still in the process of determining the impact of fin  but we believe that it will not require additional financial statement disclosure 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
the fasb has transformed its exposure draft on accounting for special purpose entities into this interpretation on variable interest entities 
fin provides new guidance on consolidation of controlled entities  irrespective of voting interests 
the financial statement disclosure requirements of fin are effective immediately and the new accounting requirements under fin are applicable to new vies created after january  we are still in the process of determining the impact of fin but we believe that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures  management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
within days prior to the date of this report  we carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and with the participation of management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
based on the foregoing  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit agreements and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates  although we use our line of credit for short term borrowing purposes  and could enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we are not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes nor do we enter into energy or commodity contracts 
additionally  we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december  in relation to total assets of  and a market capitalization of  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate libor debt average interest rate principal amounts shown are in thousands 
excludes unamortized discounts on senior notes  net of unamortized premiums on notes payable  of  the fair value of notes payable  line of credit and senior notes payable approximates the carrying amount based on the current rates offered for loans with similar risks and maturities 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period and interest rates
