item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december  we owned properties and we are a member of four joint ventures that owned a total of properties 
our properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
we intend to adhere to these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we borrow funds on a secured and unsecured basis to finance the purchase of real estate and we intend to continue to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
in the latter part of and in  we entered into two joint ventures organized for the purpose of acquiring and owning megaplex stadium style movie theaters 
we own a equity interest in the first joint venture organized for this purpose and a equity interest in the second joint venture organized for this purpose 
these joint ventures have acquired one partial stadium style movie theater and eight megaplex stadium style movie theaters for a total consideration of million 
our equity investment in these ventures at december  was million  net of distributions from the joint ventures 
venturers holding at least of the aggregate membership interests in both these joint ventures must approve all material decisions  except for property acquisitions which require unanimous approval 
under the joint venture operating agreements  we receive an acquisition fee from each venture equal to of the purchase price of each property acquired by the joint venture  other than the initial property acquired in in addition  majestic property management corp  a company owned by our chairman of the board and in which certain of our executive officers are officers  will receive a management fee equal to of all rents received by the joint ventures from single tenant properties and a management fee equal to of all rents received by the joint ventures from multi tenant properties 
majestic will receive leasing and mortgage brokerage fees at any property owned by the joint ventures at a rate equal to of the then market cost 
majestic will also receive a construction supervision fee equal to of the cost of any capital improvements to a joint venture owned property and a sales commission equal to of the sales price of any properties that are sold 
in february  we contributed our leasehold interest in an industrial property in miami  florida to a joint venture with the owners of the fee estate in that property in exchange for an approximately interest in the joint venture 
in december  we invested million for a interest in a joint venture which owns a free standing retail property located in shreveport  louisiana 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues our revenues consist primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
in the latter part of we identified megaplex movie theaters  particularly stadium style movie theaters  as an attractive investment opportunity and made a business judgment to invest in this class of assets with joint venture partners 
our equity investment in movie theater joint ventures was million at december   net of distributions from the joint ventures 
in february we contributed our leasehold position in an industrial building to a joint venture organized by us with the owners of the fee estate of the property and in december  we invested million in a joint venture which owns one free standing retail property 
investments by us in in joint venture activities  particularly in the movie theater joint ventures  rather than solely in properties owned by us  and the contribution of our leasehold position in an industrial property to a joint venture  were the major reasons for a decrease in rental income of  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  rental income also decreased as a result of the sale of three retail properties and the vacancy of two retail properties in rental income was positively impacted by rent increases at five of our properties and from rental income earned on three properties acquired by us between september and december interest and other income increased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  approximately  of this increase was due to net acquisition fees received by us from the movie theater joint ventures 
the net acquisition fees  calculated pursuant to our joint venture agreements at of the purchase price of eight properties acquired during  reflects a reduction based on our proportionate share of ownership in the joint ventures 
interest earned on three mortgages  totaling approximately million  acquired by us during august in connection with the acquisition by one of our joint ventures of an eight screen partial stadium style theater accounted for  of the increase in interest and other income 
to a lesser extent  this increase is due to the investment in cash equivalents and treasury bills of the balance of the net proceeds received from our may public offering 
our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures  totaling  in  in  more than exceeded the  decrease in rental revenues in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures consists of  in from the nine movie theater properties owned by our two movie theater joint ventures 
in our movie theater joint ventures owned one movie theater for the entire year  with the other eight theaters being acquired at various times between april and december see business megaplex theater joint ventures in part i of this annual report on form k 
in our movie theater joint ventures owned one theater for less than two full months 
in we also recognized  as our equity share in the earnings of the joint venture organized in february that owns an industrial building in miami  florida 
the other joint venture we participate in was organized in december and recorded a loss of  in due to costs incurred in organizing the venture 
we will continue to acquire  solely for our own account  improved commercial properties in accordance with our business and investment strategies as outlined in part of this annual report 
we anticipate that the acquisition of megaplex movie theaters will be made through the existing or newly organized joint ventures  and we may from time to time acquire properties with joint venture partners 
expenses interest mortgages payable increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from mortgages placed on two properties during march and april  and was offset in part by the payoff of two mortgage loans totaling million during june interest line of credit decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from our repayment of all of the outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit during we subsequently borrowed million under our line of credit during may  which was used for our contribution to one of our joint ventures for the purchase of two movie theaters 
the borrowing was repaid with a portion of the proceeds received from our public offering completed in may we subsequently borrowed million under our line of credit during december  which was used to purchase a property 
leasehold rent expense decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this rent expense was payable on the leasehold interest position that we contributed during february to a joint venture in which we hold an approximately interest 
therefore  effective february  we no longer paid leasehold rent 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in payroll and payroll expenses  including approximately  for executive and support personnel  primarily for legal and accounting services  allocated to us pursuant to a shared services agreement between us and related entities 
the increase in the allocated payroll expenses resulted from an increase in our level of business activity  primarily property acquisition activity 
the increase in payroll expenses is also due to compensation and fees approved by our compensation committee and board of directors and recorded during the year ended december  as follows an increase of  in the base salary and a bonus of  to our president and chief executive officer and a fee of  per annum to the chairman of our board of directors 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to a number of items including public company expenses  professional fees  travel  franchise taxes and minor increases in several other categories of general and administrative expenses 
these increases were offset in part by the receipt by us of  from one of our movie theater joint ventures as partial reimbursement of legal services allocated to us under the shared services agreement  for movie theater acquisitions and mortgage financing 
on may   we sold million shares of common stock in a follow on public offering 
allocated payroll and payroll related expenses  primarily for legal and accounting services resulting from time expended by various executive and administrative personnel in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration statement on form s  declared effective by the sec on may   have been included in the line item public offering expenses for the year ended december   all of which are nonrecurring 
real estate expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the write off of a leasing commission and non recurring landlord repairs during comparison of years ended december  and revenues revenue consists primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  rental income increased for as a result of the addition of rental income for the full year from eight properties which were acquired at various times during the increase in rental income for was partially offset by an  reduction in rental income as a result of the sale of properties in october interest and other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a reduction in interest earned on cash and cash equivalents available for investment because cash and cash equivalents were used during to fund property acquisitions 
in november we entered into a joint venture which acquired a stadium style movie theater in norwalk  california 
in we recognized  as our equity share in the earnings of this unconsolidated joint venture 
expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from depreciation recorded on the eight properties acquired during the increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation resulting from the sale of properties during interest mortgages payable increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from mortgages placed on seven properties acquired during interest line of credit decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from reduced borrowings under our credit facility as a result of our repayment of all of the indebtedness under our line of credit during this indebtedness was incurred to facilitate the purchase of several properties during and was repaid using the proceeds from mortgage financings on two properties purchased in december general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses and advertising and promotional expenses resulting from an increase in our level of business activity 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the write off of leasing commissions  non recurring landlord repairs and certain real estate expenses and taxes not rebilled to tenants 
the results of operations for included a refund of real estate taxes received during that period 
during the year ended december   we determined that the estimated fair value of two properties was lower than their carrying amounts and therefore  we recorded a provision for valuation adjustment of real estate for the differences of  this fair value was determined using projected undiscounted cash flows based on our determination and analysis of market conditions in the geographic areas in which these properties are located  including current rental rates  the location of the properties and occupancy levels of similar properties in the surrounding area 
both properties are single tenant locations where an indication was given that neither tenant would renew its lease on its expiration date at the end of and  respectively 
the  provision was recorded as a direct write down of the respective investments on the balance sheet and depreciation was calculated using the new basis 
there was no comparable adjustment during gain on sale of real estate gain on sale of real estate decreased by million  or  to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to fewer sales of real estate in in we sold two properties  in which the gain of  from our august sale was offset in part by a  loss from our may sale 
in  we sold properties  including total petroleum properties  inc locations which resulted in a gain of million for financial statement purposes  as well as a gain of  on the sale of a property in may and a gain of  on the sale of a property in february liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities 
on march  we entered into a new credit agreement with valley national bank  merchants bank division and bank leumi  usa for a million revolving credit facility 
this facility  which replaced a million revolving credit facility  is available to us to pay down existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  currently  and there is an unused facility fee of one quarter of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
there is currently million outstanding under the facility 
the million was borrowed to repay the same amount outstanding under our old credit facility 
on february   we acquired a retail property for a purchase price of approximately million 
a portion of the purchase price was paid in cash and a portion by the assumption of a pre existing mortgage of approximately million 
we  on our own behalf and on behalf of our joint ventures  are involved in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of additional net leased properties  but have not entered into agreements to purchase any additional properties 
the megaplex movie theater joint ventures will only acquire movie theater properties 
we will use the cash provided from operations  cash provided from mortgage financings  including distributions from joint ventures resulting from their mortgage financings  and our credit facility to fund any additional acquisitions 
the megaplex movie theater joint ventures have filed mortgage applications with an institutional lender for mortgage loans aggregating million secured by the three unencumbered properties owned by the ventures 
the mortgage loans on the brooklyn movie theater property  which are owned by us and on which there is million outstanding  are being refinanced 
after completion of these financings  of which there is no assurance  we will receive approximately million  including a payoff of the mortgages on the brooklyn theater held by us 
the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   all of which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties  for the periods indicated amounts in thousands due within year  due to years  due to years  due after years  as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
at december   management has not taken a reserve or direct write off against the unbilled rent receivable of million 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  its location  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
we also ascertain appropriate capitalization rates for the real estate asset in the area in which the property is located and apply such capitalization rate to the net operating income derived from that asset 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
there were no valuation adjustments recorded in and certain relationships and allocated expenses we note the following relationships fredric h
