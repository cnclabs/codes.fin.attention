at december   united security had consolidated assets of approximately million and operated seventeen banking locations in five counties 
these seventeen locations contributed approximately million to consolidated net income in the bank s sole business is banking  therefore  loans and investments are its principal sources of income 
discussions of certain matters contained in this annual report on form k may contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of such term in the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of united security and the bank related to  among other things a 
trends or uncertainties in economic and business conditions which will impact future operating results  liquidity and capital resources and the relationship among those trends or uncertainties and nonperforming loans and other loans  b 
the diversification of product production among timber related entities and the effect of that diversification on the bank s concentration of loans to timber related entities  c 
the composition of united security s derivative securities portfolio and its interest rate hedging strategies and volatility caused by uncertainty over the economy  inflation and future interest rate trends  d 
the effect of the market s perception of future inflation and real returns and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board on short and long term interest rates  e 
the effect of interest rate changes on liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management  f 
the amount of anticipated i net loan charge offs  ii loans on a non accrual basis  and iii derivative income  and g 
the expectations  beliefs  and plans of management as set forth in the letter to shareholders contained in this annual report 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements include  among others  the following possibilities the perceived diversification in product production when the timber industry fails to protect the bank from its concentration of loans to the timber industry as a result of  for example  the emergence of technological developments or market difficulties that affect the timber industry as a whole  periods of lower interest rates continue to accelerate the rate at which the underlying obligations of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are prepaid  thereby affecting the yield on such securities held by the bank  
table of contents inflation grows at a greater than expected rate with a material adverse effect on interest rate spreads and the assumptions management of united security has used in its interest rate hedging strategies and interest rate sensitivity gap strategies  rising interest rates adversely affect the demand for consumer credit  general economic conditions  either nationally or in alabama and mississippi  are less favorable than expected  and the effects of  and changes in  federal and state laws  regulations and policies affecting banking  insurance and monetary and financial matters 
critical accounting policies the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies relate to securities  loans  allowance for loan losses  accounting estimates  derivatives and hedging 
a description of these policies  which significantly affect the determination of financial position  results of operations and cash flows  are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial condition united security s financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of the bank s assets  liabilities  capital structure  the quality of its personnel  and prevailing market and economic conditions 
the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry  resulting in the need to increase equity capital at rates greater than the applicable inflation rate in order to maintain an appropriate equity to asset ratio 
also  the category of other expenses tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
the bank owns all of the stock of acceptance loan company  inc alc  an alabama corporation 
alc is a finance company with twenty six offices organized for the purpose of making consumer loans 
the bank is alc s only source of funds  which amounts to approximately million 
alc reported a net income of million for the year ended december  this is an improvement over the million loss in management believes the most significant factor in producing quality financial results is the bank s ability to react properly and in a timely manner to changes in interest rates 
management  therefore  continues to maintain a more balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations

table of contents logo loans and allowances for loan losses total loans outstanding increased by million in with million outstanding at year end 
loans represent of the company s earning assets and provide of interest income 
real estate loans make up of total gross loans at year end  up from last year 
these loans consist of construction loans to both businesses and individuals on residential and commercial development  commercial buildings and apartment complexes  with most of this activity being commercial 
real estate loans also consist of other loans secured by real estate  such as one to four family dwellings  including mobile homes  loans on land only  multi family dwellings  non farm non residential real estate and home equity loans 
commercial loans totaled million at year end these loans decreased million or from year end to year end while these loans decreased last year  they have grown over the last five years 
this decrease over the past year is due to decreased loan demand as a result of a sluggish economy 
consumer loans are the second largest group of loans which represents of total loans outstanding 
they amount to million at year end  a decline from these loans include loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures  including credit cards and other related credit plans 
of these loans are originated at alc 
consumer loans at alc declined from to  due primarily to the sale of two production offices located in the state of florida 
consumer loans at the bank grew million  or from year end to the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level  which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  including the nature of the portfolio and changes in its risk profile  credit concentrations  historical trends  and economic conditions 
this evaluation also considers the balance of impaired loans 
losses on individually identified impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s original effective market interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through the provision added to the allowance for loan losses 
one to four family residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are subjected to a collective evaluation for impairment  considering delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and other factors 
though management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate  ultimate losses may vary from their estimates 
however  estimates are reviewed periodically  and as adjustments become necessary they are reported in earnings during periods they become known 
the bank s loan policy requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to the repayment of the principal balance of a loan 
consumer installment loans at the bank and alc are generally recognized as losses if they become days and days delinquent  respectively 
the only exception to this policy occurs when the underlying value of the collateral or the customer s financial position makes a loss unlikely 
a credit review of the bank s individual loans is conducted periodically by branch and by loan officer 
a risk rating is assigned to each loan and is reviewed at least annually 
in assigning risk  management takes into consideration the capacity of the borrower to repay  collateral values  current economic conditions and other factors 

table of contents loan officers and other personnel handling loan transactions undergo frequent training dedicated to improving the credit quality as well as the yield of the loan portfolio 
the bank utilizes a written loan policy  which attempts to guide lending personnel in maintaining consistent underwriting standards 
this policy is intended to aid loan officers and lending personnel in making sound credit decisions and to assure compliance with state and federal regulations 
in order to better manage credit risk  alc oversees its portfolio through formal underwriting standards  monitoring of customer payments and active follow up 
alc assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on an aggregate level based upon recent delinquency status and estimates of inherent loss from historical experience within these portfolios 
alc concentrates more on loans secured by real estate and places less emphasis on automobile loans 
the following table shows the company s loan distribution as of december      and december  in thousands of dollars commercial  financial and agricultural real estate installment less unearned interest  commissions fees total the amounts of total loans excluding installment loans outstanding at december   which  based on the remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due in one year or less  more than one year but within five years  and more than five years  are shown in the following table 
maturing within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands of dollars commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate mortgage total variable rate loans totaled approximately million and are included in the one year category 
the bank and alc ended the year with an allowance for loan losses of million  the same as december  total loans charged off in totaled million 
recoveries on loans previously charged off totaled million  resulting in net charge offs of million 
net charge offs for totaled million 
management charged to operations million in as an addition to the allowance for loan losses 
this compares to million charged to operations for of the net charge offs of million  million represents charge offs from alc loans and million from the bank 
net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to in primarily due to improved credit quality related to alc s portfolio 

table of contents non performing assets the following table presents information on non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
december  in thousands of dollars non performing assets loans accounted for on a non accrual basis accruing loans past due days or more real estate acquired in settlement of loans total percent of net loans and other real estate accruing loans past due days or more at december   totaled million 
these loans are secured  and  taking into consideration the collateral value and the financial strength of the borrowers  management believes there will be no loss in these accounts and allowed the loans to continue accruing 
loans past due days or more and originated by alc totaled million at december   or of all loans past due days and more and still accruing 
at december  and  the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired was  and  respectively  all of which were on a non accrual basis at year end 
there was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively  in the allowance for loan lossses specifically allocated to these impaired loans 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
no material amount of interest income was recognized in impaired loans for the years ended december  and non performing assets as a percentage of net loans and other real estate was at december  this increase from is due primarily to four loans 
management reviews these loans and reports to the board of directors monthly 
management has set a goal to reduce the to or lower during loans past due days or more and still accruing are reviewed closely by management and are allowed to continue accruing only when underlying collateral values and management s belief that the financial strength of the borrowers is sufficient to protect the bank from loss 
if at any time management determines there may be a loss of interest or principal  these loans will be changed to non accrual and their asset value downgraded 
the bank discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when management has reason to believe the financial condition of the borrower has deteriorated so that the collection of interest is in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income unless the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest 
interest received on non accrual loans is generally either applied against the principal or recognized on a cash basis  according to management s judgment as to whether the borrower can ultimately repay the loan 
a loan may be restored to accrual status if the obligation is brought current  performs in accordance with the contract for a reasonable period  and if management determines that the repayment of the total debt is no longer in doubt 
summarized below is information concerning the income on those loans with deferred interest or principal payments resulting from deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
december  in thousands of dollars total loans accounted for on a non accrual basis interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income reported and recorded during the year at december   non accrual loans totaled million or of loans  compared to million or of loans at december  this increase in non accrual loans at december   was primarily due to increased levels of commercial and real estate loans being placed on non accrual status 
three large commercial real estate loans totaling approximately million account for substantially all of the increase 
the majority of the loans in this category are in the process of liquidation or management has commitments from the principals involved for reduction during the year 
under 
table of contents lying collateral values support those loans which are not already in liquidation 
management continues to emphasize asset quality and believes that at december   it has adequate reserves for losses inherent in this portion of the portfolio 
lending officers and other personnel involved in the lending process receive ongoing training in compliance as well as asset quality 
the bank has no foreign loans 
the bank does not make loans on commercial property outside its market area without prior approval of the board of directors or the directors loan committee 
allocation of allowance for loan losses the following table shows an allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the five years indicated 
december  allowance allocation percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance allocation percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance allocation percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance allocation percent of loans in each category to total loans allowance allocation percent of loans in each category to total loans in thousands of dollars commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate installment total the allowance for loan losses is established by risk group as follows large classified loans  non accrual loans  and impaired loans are evaluated individually with specific reserves allocated based on management s review 
smaller non accrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
smaller past due loans are assigned a portion of the allowance using a formula that is based on the severity of the delinquency 
the remainder of the portfolio is also allocated a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and the economic conditions for the particular loan portfolio 
allocation weights are assigned based on the bank s historical loan loss experience in each category  although a higher allocation weight may be used if current conditions indicate that the loan losses may exceed historical experience 
while the total allowance is described as consisting of the portions described above  all portions are available to support inherent losses in the loan portfolio

there are several major paper mills in our trade area including the alabama river companies  boise cascade  georgia pacific and weyerhauser 
in addition  there are several sawmills  lumber companies  and pole and piling producers 
the table below shows the dollar amount of loans made to timber and timber related companies as of december  the amount of timber related loans decreased from million in to million in the percentage of timber related loans to gross loans decreased from in to in timber related loans total gross loans percentage of total loans million million management realizes that the company is reasonably dependent on the economic health of the timber related industries 
accordingly  this represents a concentration of loans in timber and timber related industries 
we continue to feel these risks are reduced by the diversification of product production within these industries 
some of the mills and industries specialize in paper and pulp  some in lumber and plywood  some in poles and pilings  and others in wood and veneer 
we do not believe that this concentration is excessive or that it represents a trend which might materially impact future earnings  liquidity  or capital resources of the company 
historically  the company has benefited from the industries engaged in the growing  harvesting  processing and marketing of timber and timber related products 
the majority of the land in our trade area is used to grow pine and hardwood timber 

table of contents investments in limited partnerships the bank invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects to receive tax benefits in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits 
the bank accounts for the investments under either the equity or the cost method based on the percentage ownership and influence over operations 
the bank s interest in these partnerships was million and million for and  respectively 
changes to earnings associated with the partnerships carried under the equity method amounted to approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
management analyzes these investments annually for impairment 
the assets and liabilities of these partnerships consist primarily of apartment complexes and related mortgages 
the bank s carrying value approximates cost or its underlying equity in the net assets of the partnerships 
the bank had no remaining cash commitments to these partnerships at december  although these investments are considered non earning assets  they do contribute to the bottom line in the form of federal income tax credits 
these credits amounted to  in and are estimated to be approximately  for also  operating losses related to these partnerships are available as deductions for taxes on the bank s books 
investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments logo investment securities available for sale included mortgage backed securities of million  state  county and municipal securities of million  and other securities of million 
the securities portfolio is carried at fair value  and it decreased million from december   to december   as a result of an overall decrease in investments  net of increases in unrealized gains due to changes in the rate environment 
at december   approximately million in collateral mortgage obligations cmo held by the bank had floating interest rates which reprice monthly  and million had fixed interest rates 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities has been purchases of agency guaranteed mortgage backed obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the mortgage backed obligations in which the bank invests represent an undivided interest in a pool of residential mortgages or may be collateralized by a pool of residential mortgages mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities have yield and maturity characteristics corresponding to the underlying mortgages and are subject to principal prepayment  refinancing  or foreclosure of the underlying mortgages 
although maturities of the underlying mortgage loans may range up to years  scheduled principal and normal prepayments substantially shorten the effective maturities 
as of december   the investment portfolio had an estimated average effective maturity of years 
interest rate risk contained in the overall securities portfolio is formally monitored on a monthly basis 
management assesses each month how risk levels in the investment portfolio affect overall company wide interest rate risk 
expected changes in forecasted yield  earnings and market value of the bond portfolio are generally attributable to fluctuations in interest rates  as well as volatility caused by general uncertainty over the economy  inflation  and future interest rate trends 
mortgage backed securities and cmos present some degree of additional risk in that mortgages collateralizing these securities can be prepaid  thereby affecting the yield and market value of the portfolio 
the composition of the bank s investment portfolio reflects the bank s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the bank s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the bank s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
fair market values of securities vary significantly as interest rates change 
the gross unrealized gains and losses in the

there were net unrealized gains  net of taxes  of million in the securities portfolio on december   versus net unrealized gains  net of taxes  of million one year ago 
the bank has used certain derivative products for hedging purposes 
these include interest rate swaps and caps 
the use and detail regarding these products are fully discussed under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  effective january   as required by the financial accounting standards board 
on that date  the bank reassessed and designated derivative instruments used for risk management as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  as appropriate 
on january   the bank had derivatives with a notional value of million 
in conjunction with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the bank recorded a transition adjustment of  net of taxes  to accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to earnings of  to reflect the fair value of such instruments on january  investment securities available for sale the following table sets forth the amortized costs of investment securities as well as their fair value and related unrealized gains or losses at the dates indicated

the sensitivity of the bank s deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in its average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
during  market interest rates continued to decline dramatically throughout the year 
the bank s average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits followed this trend 
management  as part of an overall program to emphasize the growth of transaction accounts  continues to promote on line banking and a bill paying program as well as enhancing the telephone banking product and the employee incentive plan 
in addition  an increased effort is being placed on deposit promotions  direct mail campaigns and cross selling efforts 
other interest bearing liabilities other interest bearing liabilities include all interest bearing liabilities except deposits  such as federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
this category continues to be more fully utilized as an alternative source of funds as evidenced by the million  or  increase in average borrowing during the increase was due to a increase in average long term advances from the fhlb 
the advances from the fhlb are an alternative to funding sources with similar maturities such as certificates of deposit 
these advances generally offer more attractive rates when compared to other mid term financing options

table of contents shareholders equity united security has always placed great emphasis on maintaining its strong capital base 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million  or of total assets compared to and for year end and  respectively 
this level of equity indicates to united security s shareholders  customers and regulators that united security is financially sound and offers the ability to sustain an appropriate degree of leverage to provide a desirable level of profitability and growth 
over the last three years shareholders equity grew from million at the beginning of to million at the end of this growth was the result of internally generated retained earnings  with the exception of approximately  from stock options being exercised 
shareholders equity was also impacted by the net change in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this adjustment was a million   and  increase respectively for years   and the most significant impact on shareholders equity  however  was the stock repurchase plan united security initiated in may of at year end a total of  shares were repurchased as treasury stock reducing shareholders equity by million 
at year end an additional  shares were repurchased to reduce equity by an additional million 
while the stock repurchase plan has reduced total shareholders equity  united security s capital base remains a source of strength as noted above  and the internal capital generation rate net income less cash dividends as a percentage of average shareholders equity remains favorable at in  in and in united security is required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and fdic 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each with a specified risk weighting factor 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the banking regulatory agencies have also adopted regulations which supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum leverage ratio of of tier capital as defined below to total assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of or higher than the minimum level 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits  and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier ii capital is total risk based capital 
the following chart summarizes the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
united security s capital ratios at december   substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements

table of contents risk based capital requirements minimum regulatory requirements united security s ratio at december  total capital to risk adjusted assets tier i capital to risk adjusted assets tier i leverage ratio total capital also has an important effect on the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid

table of contents ratio analysis the following table presents operating and equity performance ratios for each of the last three years 
year ended december  return on average assets return on average equity cash dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary function of asset and liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the bank would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
interest rate risk management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management ensures that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the effect of such interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily from loan principal payments and maturities and through sales  maturities  and principal payments from the investment portfolio 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
loans maturing or repricing in one year or less amounted to million at december  investment securities maturing or repricing in the same time frame totaled million or of the investment portfolio at year end in addition  principal payments on mortgage backed securities and cmos totaled million in the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  short term and long term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
liquidity management involves the continual monitoring of the sources and uses of funds to maintain an acceptable cash position 
long term liquidity management focuses on considerations related to the total balance sheet structure 
although the majority of the securities portfolio has stated maturities longer than years  the entire portfolio consists of securities that are readily marketable and which are easily convertible into cash 
as of december   the bond portfolio had an expected average maturity of years  and approximately of the million in bonds were expected to be repaid within years 
however  management does not rely solely upon the investment portfolio to generate cash flows to fund loans  capital expenditures  dividends  debt repayment  and other cash requirements 
instead  these activities are funded by cash flows from operating activities and increases in deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank  at december   had long term debt and short term borrowings that  on average  represent of total liabilities and equity 
the bank currently has up to million in additional borrowing capacity from the federal home loan bank and million in established federal funds lines 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames during which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates  either at replacement or maturity  during the life of the instruments 
sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and the volume of liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
these differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps and are usually calculated for segments of time and on a cumulative basis 

table of contents changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus affecting net interest income 
it should be noted  therefore  that a matched interest sensitive position by itself will not ensure maximum net interest income 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates  and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in general levels of interest rates 
measuring interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a technique used to measure interest rate sensitivity at a particular point in time  an example of which is presented below 
assets and liabilities are placed in gap intervals based on their repricing dates 
assets and liabilities for which no specific repricing dates exist are placed in gap intervals based on management s judgment concerning their most likely repricing behaviors 
derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management are also included in the applicable gap intervals 
a net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilities repricing in that interval from the assets repricing 
a positive gap more assets repricing than liabilities will benefit net interest income if rates are rising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets will benefit net interest income in a declining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
gap analysis is the simplest representation of the bank s interest rate sensitivity 
however  it cannot reveal the impact of factors such as administered rates  pricing strategies on consumer and business deposits  changes in balance sheet mix  or the effect of various options embedded in balance sheet instruments 

table of contents the accompanying table shows the bank s rate sensitive position at december   as measured by gap analysis 
over the next months approximately million more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets can be repriced to current market rates at least once 
this analysis indicated that the bank has a negative gap within the next month range

historically  balances on non maturity deposit accounts have remained relatively stable despite changes in market interest rates 
management has classified certain of these accounts as non rate sensitive based on management s historical pricing practices and runoff experience 
approximately of the interest bearing demand deposit account balances and savings account balances are classified as over one year 
certain interest sensitive assets and liabilities are included in the table based on historical repricing experience and expected prepayments in the case of mortgage backed securities rather than contractual maturities 
non accruing loans are included in loans at the contractual maturity 
the bank uses additional tools to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
these include interest income and interest margin simulation analysis and economic changes in market value of equity analysis 
both analyses are methods of estimating earnings at risk and capital at risk under varying interest rate conditions 
they are used to test the sensitivity of net interest income and the market value of stockholders equity to changing levels of interest rates and incorporate adjustments for both the timing and the magnitude of asset and liability cash flows 
additionally  these measures capture adjustments for 
table of contents the lag between movements in market interest rates and the movements of administered rates on prime rate loans  interest bearing transaction accounts  regular savings  and money market savings accounts 
income simulation analysis indicates that the bank is slightly asset sensitive 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect a given parallel interest rate shift would have on net interest income over a two year period

the bank follows a uniform process to calculate the duration of each asset and liability category 
the first step is to assemble maturity and repricing data for categories of loans  investments  cds and other financial instruments with contractual maturities 
the second step is to determine how bank management  where appropriate  would alter the interest rate for each category of assets and liabilities assuming market interest rates rose or fell 
the third step is to combine the maturity analysis and repricing assumptions in order to calculate a modified duration estimate for each category 
the fourth 
table of contents step is to calculate a weighted average for total assets and liabilities  and the fifth step is to multiply the calculated modified duration difference for both up and down interest rate scenarios in step four by total assets 
based on the current position of the balance sheet  management believes these estimates reflect how the market value of each asset and liability would change as interest rates change  and in total  reflect the changes in market values of equity 
in this methodology  all non rate sensitive assets and liabilities are assigned a modified duration equal to years 
additionally  estimates of modified duration incorporate the likelihood that some assets and liabilities would change maturities as interest rates change 
this method also incorporates management s belief that deposit and loan rates would not rise or fall equally either by category or by interest rate scenario 
there is no allowance for growth or runoff in deposit or loan balances 
the duration analysis presented above suggests that the bank s earnings should increase slightly if interest rates rise and should decrease slightly if interest rates fall over the five year time horizon 
as part of the ongoing monitoring of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  the bank enters into various interest rate contracts interest rate protection contracts to help manage the bank s interest sensitivity 
these contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include i interest rate swaps where the bank typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  ii interest rate caps and floors purchased where the bank receives interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
all interest rate swaps represent end user activities and are designed as hedges 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps  and floors classified as hedges are ultimately reflected as adjustments to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated market value of interest rate protection contracts are reflected in either the bank s income statement or balance sheet 
a discussion of interest rate risks  credit risks and concentrations in derivative instruments is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commitments the bank maintains financial instruments with risk exposure not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these financial instruments are executed in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its investing and trading activities 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans  options written  standby letters of credit  and commitments to purchase securities for forward delivery 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank applies the same credit policy in making these commitments that it uses for on balance sheet items 
collateral obtained upon exercise of the commitment is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower and may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  land  and other items 
the bank normally does not require collateral for standby letters of credit 
as of december   the bank had outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to make loans of  and million  respectively 
for options written and commitments to purchase securities for forward delivery  the contractual amounts reflect the extent of the bank s involvement in various classes of financial instruments and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank controls the credit risk of these instruments through credit approvals  limits  and monitoring procedures 
options are contracts that allow the buyer of the option to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a specified price and within a specified period of time from or to the seller or writer of the option 
as a writer of options  the bank is paid a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the financial instrument underlying the option 
as of december   the bank had no outstanding options 
commitments to buy and sell securities for delayed delivery require the bank to buy and sell a specified security at a specified price for delivery on a specified date 
market risk arises from potential movements in securities values and interest rates between the commitment and delivery dates 
there were no commitments to sell securities for delayed delivery and no commitments to purchase securities as of december  the bank is prepared to fulfill the above commitments through scheduled maturities of loans and securities along with cash flows from operations  anticipated growth in deposits  and short term borrowings 

table of contents operating results net interest income net interest income interest income less interest expense is an effective measurement of how well management has matched interest rate sensitive assets and interest bearing liabilities and is the bank s principal source of income 
the fluctuations in interest rates materially affect net interest income 
the accompanying graph analyzes these changes 
net interest income increased by million  or  in compared to a decrease and a increase in and  respectively 
volume  rate and yield changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the increase in net interest income 
much of this change has resulted from an increase in loan volume and a decrease in investment securities volume  as a result of the earning asset strategy and a continued declining rate environment in average interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million 
volume changes of equal amounts in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities generally increase net interest income because of the spread between the yield on loans and investments and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  average interest bearing liabilities outgained average interest earning assets by million  and while the continued declining interest rates had an adverse effect on interest income  it had a more positive effect on lowering interest expense 
the bank s ability to produce net interest income is measured by a ratio called the interest margin 
the interest margin is net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
the interest margin was in compared to in and in interest margins are affected by several factors  one of which is the relationship of rate sensitive earning assets to rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
this factor determines the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on net interest income 
rate sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time 
the bank s objective in managing interest rate sensitivity is to achieve reasonable stability in the interest margin throughout interest rate cycles by maintaining the proper balance of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for further analysis and discussion of interest rate sensitivity  refer to the preceding section entitled liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management 
another factor that affects the interest margin is the interest rate spread 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this measurement gives a more accurate representation of the effect market interest rate movements have on interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the average amount of the interest bearing liabilities as noted in the table  distribution of logo logo 
table of contents assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  with interest rates and interest differentials  increased in  while the average rate of interest paid decreased from in to in average interest earning assets increased in  while the average yield on earning assets decreased from in to in the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities also affects the bank s interest margin 
the bank s earning assets are funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing demand deposits  and shareholders equity 
the net return on earning assets funded by non interest bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity exceeds the net return on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the bank maintains a relatively consistent percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
in  of the bank s average earning assets were funded by interest bearing liabilities as opposed to in and in net interest income usually improves as earning assets are funded by a decreasing percentage of interest bearing liabilities

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an expense used to establish the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  are charged directly to the allowance 
the expense recorded each year is a reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance to absorb losses inherent to the portfolio 
charge offs exceeded recoveries by million during the year  a decrease of million over the prior year  and accordingly a provision of million was expensed for loan losses in the allowance is at of total loans outstanding at december   compared to in the decrease in charge offs net of recoveries was due to continued improvements in the alc loan portfolio

non interest income non interest income consists of revenues generated by a broad range of financial services and activities  including fee based services and commissions earned through insurance sales and trading activities 
in addition  gains and losses from the sale of investment portfolio securities are included in non interest income 
the bank introduced an overdraft protection product in called bounce protection 
this product allows for automatic payment of a non sufficient fund check  and the fees it generated coupled with a new daily overdraft fee contributed to the increase in service and other charges on deposit accounts in  in and in the increase in credit life insurance premium volume was offset by the decrease in other income in non recurring items of non interest income include all the investment securities gains and losses 
investment securities had a net gain of  in compared to a  gain in and a  gain in income generated in the area of securities gains and losses is dependent on many factors including investment portfolio strategies  interest rate changes  and the short  intermediate  and long term outlook for the economy 
the bank organized a wholly owned subsidiary  fusb reinsurance  inc  in this company reinsures or underwrites credit life  credit accident and health insurance policies sold to the bank s consumer loan customers 
fusb reinsurance  inc is responsible for the first level of risk on the policies up to a specified maximum amount  and the primary third party insurer retains the remaining risk 
as a result  more credit life insurance premiums and commissions are retained by the bank 
these premiums and commissions increased from  in to  in 
table of contents the bank continues to search for new sources of non interest income 
these sources will come from innovative ways of performing banking services now as well as providing new services in the future 
the reinsurance company is an example of this philosophy

these expenses were impacted by the closing of one office in  three offices in  and three offices in additionally  the bank opened one new branch office in management continues to evaluate the profitability of all locations and as a result of the closures in  personnel and other office associated expenses were reduced 
these events impacted the ratio of non interest expense to average assets  and the ratio remained stable during the period at  and in   and  respectively 
total salaries and benefits increased approximately  or  in this increase is attributable to a combination of normal merit adjustments  the staffing of our new calera office and the closing of three alc offices in the decrease of in was due to the closing of three alc offices  and the increase of in was due to normal merit increases

management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries may be able to generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
however  a portion of the amount of the deferred tax asset that can be realized in any year is subject to certain statutory federal income tax limitations 
because of these uncertainties  a valuation allowance has been established 
management periodically evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax asset and  if necessary  adjusts the valuation allowance accordingly
