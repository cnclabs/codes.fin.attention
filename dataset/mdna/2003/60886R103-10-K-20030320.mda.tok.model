item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has conducted a series of acquisitions during its history  beginning in march when the company commenced operations by acquiring substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a predecessor company that had been formed in in march  the company acquired from harley davidson certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of its holiday rambler division and acquired certain related dealerships 
in august  the company acquired smc corporation  manufacturer of the beaver and safari brand motorhomes 
in november  the company acquired from outdoor resorts of america ora three luxury motor coach resort properties being developed by ora in las vegas  nevada  indio  california  and naples  florida 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the acquired operations have in each case been incorporated into the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years   and contain various acquisition related expenses including  in and  amortization of goodwill related to the acquisition of the company s predecessor and interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and goodwill relating to the acquisition of holiday rambler 
additionally  the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and contain interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the acquisition of smc corporation and  for fiscal year  interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the resort acquisition 
for years prior to  the company amortized the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of the predecessor and holiday rambler using the straight line method over a year period 
however  in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no goodwill amortization was recorded for the acquisition of smc corporation for the fiscal year ended december   and no goodwill amortization was recorded for any of the acquisitions for the fiscal year ended december  management has completed its annual testing of goodwill during as required by sfas and determined that there has been no impairment requiring a write down 
results of operations compared with net sales increased from million in to billion in the company s overall unit sales were up from  in to  units in the company s units sales were up on the motorized side with of that increase due to the addition of the safari and beaver line of products starting in the second half of gross diesel motorized sales revenues were up  while gas motorized were up  and towables were up 
this reflects a stronger mix of higher priced units in each category in as the company s overall average unit selling price increased from  in to  in the company s diesel products accounted for of total revenues while gas products were and towables were of total revenues 
gross profit increased by million from million in to million in and gross margin increased from in to in the increase in gross margin in was due to lower sales discounts and reductions in material costs as a percentage of sales 
through the first half of  the company found it necessary to offer above normal discounts to maintain sales to dealers 
the discounting returned to normal levels in the second half of and throughout reductions in material costs were attained by leveraging the company s subassembly fiberglass and cabinet shop operations with higher production levels than in the company s overall gross margin may fluctuate in future periods if the mix of products shifts from higher to lower gross margin units or if the company encounters unexpected manufacturing difficulties or competitive pressures 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in increases in spending over the prior year were due to those items that fluctuate with the increase in sales such as sales commissions  product liability expenses  advertising  promotions  general insurance  and printed brochure costs 
the reduction as a percentage of sales was mostly due to the large increase in sales compared to overall spending 
amortization of goodwill declined from  in to zero in due to the application of sfas discussed above and management s determination that there had been no impairment of goodwill as of december operating income increased million from million in to million in the company s lower level of selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales combined with the increase in the company s gross margin  resulted in an increase in operating margin from in to in net interest expense increased from million in to million in this increase was related to increased debt levels during due to higher levels of inventory compared to the prior year  combined with increased capital requirements after the smc acquisition in august of and the resort acquisition in november of no interest was capitalized in or the company s interest expense included  in and  in related to the amortization of debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the company s credit facilities 
the company also increased its long term credit facility by million in the fourth quarter of for the resort acquisition 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the company is expecting increased interest expense for based on anticipated higher debt levels 
the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of  for  compared to million  or an effective tax rate of for the change in effective tax rate was due mainly to a decreased benefit in from foreign sales 
net income increased by million from million in to million in  due to the combination of an increase in net sales and an increase in operating margin 
the company does not currently expense stock options granted  however  if option expensing were required  the impact on net income for for all previously granted options would have been a decrease of million 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for information regarding the calculation of the impact of option expense 
compared with net sales increased from million in to million in the company s overall unit sales were down from  in to  units in the company s units sales were down on the motorized side reflecting lower sales during the first half of which were nearly offset by increases in the latter part of  mostly from the addition of the safari and beaver line of products 
motorized gross sales were up reflecting the higher mix of diesel unit sales in the company s unit sales of towable products in were down only while gross sales were up as sales from the towable operations had a shift in the mix from the prior year of fewer travel trailers and more higher priced fifth wheel units 
the company s overall average unit selling price increased from  in to  in reflecting the continuing increases in sales of diesel motor coaches 
gross profit decreased by million from million in to million in and gross margin decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin in was due to a combination of factors resulting from competitive pressures in the market 
through the first half of  the company found it necessary to offer above normal discounts to maintain sales to dealers 
in addition  throughout  the company s efforts to match production with the models that were selling well in the market resulted in production inefficiencies caused by shifting volume among production lines and changing the mix of models produced on those lines  as well as integrating the safari production into the coburg facility 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million from million in to million in and increased as a percentage of sales from in to in approximately of the increase was due to retail sales and dealer promotions  as well as show and rally expenses 
the remainder of the increase was from administrative and sales wages and commissions  mostly due to the combining of smc operations which have historically run higher selling  general  and administrative costs as a percentage of sales than the company 
operating income decreased million from million in to million in the company s higher level of selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales combined with the reduction in the company s gross margin  resulted in a decrease in operating margin from in to in net interest expense increased million from thousand in to million in this increase was related to increased debt due to higher levels of inventory during the first half of  combined with cash requirements to complete the smc acquisition in the third quarter of the company capitalized  of interest expense in relating to the construction in indiana and florida  and no interest was capitalized in the company s interest expense included  in and  in related to the amortization of debt issuance costs recorded in conjunction with the company s credit facilities 
additionally  interest expense in included  from accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs related to the credit facilities 
the company also paid off its revolving credit facility in the third quarter of and obtained financing from a consortium of lenders 
the company reported a provision for income taxes of million  or an effective tax rate of  for  compared to million  or an effective tax rate of for net income decreased by million from million in to million in  due to the increase in net sales being more than offset by a lower operating margin 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities 
during  the company generated cash of million from operating activities 
the company generated million from net income and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization 
this amount was mostly offset by net changes in working capital accounts 
sources of cash included an increase in trade payables of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and reserves of million and an increase in income taxes payable of million 
the uses of cash included an increase of million in trade receivables and an increase of million in inventories 
the increase in trade receivables reflects increased shipments near the end of the fourth quarter compared to the prior year end of increased inventory levels reflect an increase in raw materials due to higher production run rates and an increase in work in process as the company implemented a new quality improvement process that added an additional stage to the final completion of the product 
the finished goods component of inventory increased by million over the prior year 
increased payables and liabilities are reflective of increased purchases for higher production run rates over the prior year  model change  accruals for current income taxes payable  and various other accrued liabilities 
the company has credit facilities consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to million of which million was outstanding at december  the revolving loan and term loans with balances of million at december  the term loans 
at the election of the company  the revolving loan and term loans bear interest at varying rates that fluctuate based on the prime rate or libor  and are determined based on the company s leverage ratio 
the company also pays interest monthly on the unused available portion of the revolving loan at varying rates  determined by the company s leverage ratio 
the revolving loan is due and payable in full on september   and requires monthly interest payments 
additional prepayments for portions of the term notes are required in the event the company sells substantially all of any motor coach resort location 
the term loans require monthly interest payments and quarterly principal payments that total million 
the revolving loan and term loans are collateralized by all the assets of the company and include various restrictions and financial covenants 
the company utilizes zero balance bank disbursement accounts in which an advance on the line of credit is automatically made for checks clearing each day 
since the balance of the disbursement account at the bank returns to zero at the end of each day  the outstanding checks of the company are reflected as a liability 
the outstanding check liability is combined with the company s positive cash balance accounts to reflect a net book overdraft or a net cash balance for financial reporting 
the company s principal working capital requirements are for purchases of inventory and financing of trade receivables 
many of the company s dealers finance product purchases under wholesale floor plan arrangements with third parties as described below 
at december   the company had working capital of approximately million  an increase of million from working capital of million at december  the company has been using short term credit facilities and cash flow to finance its capital expenditures 
the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds available under its anticipated credit facilities will be sufficient to meet the company s liquidity requirements for the next months 
the company s capital expenditures were million in  which included costs for routine capital expenditures  completing renovations in the oregon service center and indiana cabinet shop  as well as incurring costs for a paint shop addition in indiana 
the company also incurred a significant portion of the costs required to build a new florida service center  which will replace it s two existing service facilities in florida 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for all of will be approximately to million  which includes expenditures to complete the florida service center and indiana towable plant expansion  an expansion of the oregon chassis plant  and routine capital expenditures for computer system upgrades and additions  smaller scale plant remodeling projects  and normal replacement of outdated or worn out equipment 
the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address working capital and facilities expansion needs  particularly if the company significantly increases the level of working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable 
the company may also from time to time seek to acquire businesses that would complement the company s current business  and any such acquisition could require additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if required or on terms deemed favorable by the company 
as is typical in the recreational vehicle industry  many of the company s retail dealers utilize wholesale floor plan financing arrangements with third party lending institutions to finance their purchases of the company s products 
under the terms of these floor plan arrangements  institutional lenders customarily require the recreational vehicle manufacturer to agree to repurchase any unsold units if the dealer fails to meet its commitments to the lender  subject to certain conditions 
the company has agreements with several institutional lenders under which the company currently has repurchase obligations 
the company s contingent obligations under these repurchase agreements are reduced by the proceeds received upon the sale of any repurchased units 
the company s obligations under these repurchase agreements vary from period to period 
at december   approximately million of products sold by the company to independent dealers were subject to potential repurchase under existing floor plan financing agreements with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
historically  the company has been successful in mitigating losses associated with repurchase obligations 
during  the losses associated with the exercise of repurchase agreements were approximately  if the company were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement  its business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as part of the normal course of business  the company incurs certain contractual obligations and commitments which will require future cash payments 
the following tables summarize the significant obligations and commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration by period other commitments in thousands year or less to years to years thereafter total lines of credit guarantees repurchase obligations total commitments see note to the financials

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty costs  product liability  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs the company provides an estimate for accrued warranty costs at the time a product is sold 
this estimate is based on historical average repair costs  as well as other reasonable assumptions as have been deemed appropriate by management 
product liability the company provides an estimate for accrued product liability based on current pending cases  as well as for those cases which are incurred but not reported 
this estimate is developed by legal counsel based on professional judgment  as well as historical experience 
impairment of goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
this analysis involves management comparing the market capitalization of the company  to the carrying amount  including goodwill  of the net book value of the company  to determine if goodwill has been impaired 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory for obsolescence  and the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value 
these write downs are based on assumptions about future sales demand and market conditions 
if actual sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes in conjunction with preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company must estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
a discussion of the income tax provision and the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future operating results we may experience unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results for a variety of reasons our net sales  gross margin  and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to a number of factors  many of which are not readily predictable 
these factors include the following the margins associated with the mix of products we sell in any particular period 
our ability to utilize and expand our manufacturing resources efficiently 
shortages of materials used in our products 
a determination by us that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired and have to be written down to their fair values  resulting in a charge to our results of operations 
our ability to introduce new models that achieve consumer acceptance 
the introduction  marketing and sale of competing products by others  including significant discounting offered by our competitors 
the addition or loss of our dealers 
the timing of trade shows and rallies  which we use to market and sell our products 
factors affecting the recreational vehicle industry as a whole  including economic and seasonal factors 
our overall gross margin may decline in future periods to the extent that we increase the percentage of sales of lower gross margin towable products or if the mix of motor coaches we sell shifts to lower gross margin units 
in addition  a relatively small variation in the number of recreational vehicles we sell in any quarter can have a significant impact on total sales and operating results for that quarter 
demand in the recreational vehicle industry generally declines during the winter months  while sales are generally higher during the spring and summer months 
with the broader range of products we now offer  seasonal factors could have a significant impact on our operating results in the future 
additionally  unusually severe weather conditions in certain markets could delay the timing of shipments from one quarter to another 
we attempt to forecast orders for our products accurately and commence purchasing and manufacturing prior to receipt of such orders 
however  it is highly unlikely that we will consistently accurately forecast the timing  rate  and mix of orders 
this aspect of our business makes our planning inexact and  in turn  affects our shipments  costs  inventories  operating results  and cash flow for any given quarter 
the recreational vehicle industry is cyclical and susceptible to slowdowns in the general economy the recreational vehicle industry has been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand  reflecting prevailing economic  demographic  and political conditions that affect disposable income for leisure time activities 
for example  unit sales of recreational vehicles excluding conversion vehicles peaked at approximately  units in and declined to approximately  units in the industry peaked again in at approximately  units and declined in to  units 
in  the industry rebounded up to approximately  units 
our business is subject to the cyclical nature of this industry 
some of the factors that contribute to this cyclicality include fuel availability and costs  interest rate levels  the level of discretionary spending  and availability of credit and overall consumer confidence 
the recent decline in consumer confidence and slowing of the overall economy has adversely affected the recreational vehicle market 
an extended continuation of these conditions would materially affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our recent growth has put pressure on the capabilities of our operating  financial  and management information systems in the past few years  we have significantly expanded the size and scope of our business  which has required us to hire additional employees 
some of these new employees include new management personnel 
in addition  our current management personnel have assumed additional responsibilities 
the increase in our size over a relatively short period of time has put pressure on our operating  financial  and management information systems 
if we continue to expand  such growth would put additional pressure on these systems and may cause such systems to malfunction or to experience significant delays 
we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity in the past few years  we have significantly increased our manufacturing capacity 
in connection with this expansion  we have also integrated some of our manufacturing facilities 
we may experience unexpected building and production problems associated with this expansion 
in the past  we have had difficulties with the manufacturing of new models and increasing the rates of production of our plants 
our expenses have increased as a result of the expansion and we will be materially and adversely affected if the expansion does not result in an increase in revenue from new or additional products 
this expansion involves risks  including the following we must rely on timely performance by contractors  subcontractors  and government agencies  whose performance we may be unable to control 
the development of new products involves costs associated with new machinery  training of employees  and compliance with environmental  health  and other government regulations 
the newly developed products may not be successful in the marketplace 
we may be unable to complete a planned expansion in a timely manner  which could result in lower production levels and an inability to satisfy customer demand for our products 
we rely on a relatively small number of dealers for a significant percentage of our sales although our products were offered by dealerships located primarily in the united states and canada as of december   a significant percentage of our sales are concentrated among a relatively small number of independent dealers 
for the year ended december   sales to one dealer  lazy days rv center  accounted for of total sales compared to of sales in the same period ended last year 
for fiscal years and  sales to our largest dealers  including lazy days rv center  accounted for a total of 
the loss of a significant dealer or a substantial decrease in sales by any of these dealers could have a material impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may have to repurchase a dealer s inventory of our products in the event that the dealer does not repay its lender as is common in the recreational vehicle industry  we enter into repurchase agreements with the financing institutions used by our dealers to finance their purchases of our products 
these agreements require us to repurchase the dealer s inventory in the event that the dealer does not repay its lender 
obligations under these agreements vary from period to period  but totaled approximately million as of december   with approximately concentrated with one dealer 
if we were obligated to repurchase a significant number of units under any repurchase agreement  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our accounts receivable balance is subject to concentration risk we sell our product to dealers who are predominantly located in the united states and canada 
the terms and conditions of payment are a combination of open trade receivables  and commitments from dealer floor plan lending institutions 
as of december   total trade receivables were million  with approximately million  or of the outstanding accounts receivable balance concentrated among floor plan lenders 
the remaining million of trade receivables were concentrated substantially all with one dealer 
we may experience a decrease in sales of our products due to an increase in the price or a decrease in the supply of fuel an interruption in the supply  or a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale  of diesel fuel or gasoline on a regional or national basis could significantly affect our business 
diesel fuel and gasoline have  at various times in the past  been either expensive or difficult to obtain 
we depend on single or limited sources to provide us with certain important components that we use in the production of our products a number of important components for certain of our products are purchased from single or a limited number of sources 
these include turbo diesel engines cummins and caterpillar  substantially all of our transmissions allison  axles dana and meritor for all diesel motor coaches and chassis workhorse and ford for gas motor coaches 
we have no long term supply contracts with these suppliers or their distributors  and we cannot be certain that these suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements 
for example  in  allison placed all chassis manufacturers on allocation with respect to one of the transmissions that we use  and again in ford placed one of its gasoline powered chassis on allocation 
an extended delay or interruption in the supply of any components that we obtain from a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our industry is very competitive 
we must continue to introduce new models and new features to remain competitive the market for our products is very competitive 
we currently compete with a number of manufacturers of motor coaches  fifth wheel trailers  and travel trailers 
some of these companies have greater financial resources than we have and extensive distribution networks 
these companies  or new competitors in the industry  may develop products that customers in the industry prefer over our products 
we believe that the introduction of new products and new features is critical to our success 
delays in the introduction of new models or product features  quality problems associated with these introductions  or a lack of market acceptance of new models or features could affect us adversely 
for example  unexpected costs associated with model changes have affected our gross margin in the past 
further  new product introductions can divert revenues from existing models and result in fewer sales of existing products 
our products could fail to perform according to specifications or prove to be unreliable  causing damage to our customer relationships and our reputation and resulting in loss of sales our customers require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because our products are complex and often use advanced components  processes and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service and warranty and replacement costs and may cause serious damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which will negatively affect our sales and business 
our business is subject to various types of litigation  including product liability and warranty claims we are subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business  typically for product liability and warranty claims that are common in the recreational vehicle industry 
while we do not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation  net of insurance coverage  will materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition  we cannot provide assurances in this regard because litigation is an inherently uncertain process 
to date  we have been successful in obtaining product liability insurance on terms that we consider acceptable 
the terms of the policy contain a self insured retention amount of  per occurrence  with a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of million 
overall product liability insurance  including umbrella coverage  is available to a maximum amount of million for each occurrence  as well as in the aggregate 
we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at acceptable levels or that the costs of such insurance will be reasonable 
further  successful assertion against us of one or a series of large uninsured claims  or of a series of claims exceeding our insurance coverage  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  delaying product development and manufacturing our success depends in part upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals 
a number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other technical professionals  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the industry 
newly issued financial reporting pronouncements sfas in december  the board issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas this statement provides transition guidance for entities that elect to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas the statement does not change the provisions of sfas that permit entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees

fin in november  the board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and interpretation of sfas   and and rescission of fin the interpretation requires certain disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company has included the disclosure requirements in its financial statements and has determined that the recognition provisions of fin apply to certain guarantees routinely made by the company including repurchase obligations to third party lenders for inventory financing of dealer inventories 
the company anticipates recording a liability of approximately  for potential losses resulting from guarantees on products shipped to dealers starting in this estimated liability  which will be recorded primarily in the first half of  is based on the company s experience of losses associated with the repurchase and resale of units in prior years 
fin in january  the board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation addresses how variable interest entities are to be identified and how an enterprise assesses its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
the interpretation also requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
fin is effective in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that is acquired before february  the provisions of fin may apply to certain operating leases of the company that have residual value guarantees 
audit committee approval of non audit services in accordance with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for listing the non audit services approved in the three months ended december  by our audit committee to be performed by our external auditor 
non audit services are defined in the law as services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of our financial statements 
the non audit services approved by the audit committee in the three months ended december  are each considered by the company to be audit related services  which are closely related to the financial audit process 
during the three months ended december   the audit committee approved the engagement of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our external auditor  for the following non audit services tax review and consulting services during the three months ended december  not to exceed  and tax review and consulting services during fiscal year not to exceed  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our borrowings 
we do not currently use rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
our line of credit and term debt permit a combination of fixed and variable interest rate options which allows us to minimize the effect of rising interest rates by locking in fixed rates for periods of up to months 
we believe these features of our credit facilities help us reduce the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations
