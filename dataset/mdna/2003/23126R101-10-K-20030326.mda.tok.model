item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genomics based pharmaceutical development company 
we apply our integrated functional genomic technologies and internet based bioinformatic systems to discover and develop pharmaceutical products to treat unmet medical needs 
we use this information to develop protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics to treat metabolic diseases  cancer  inflammatory diseases  and central nervous system disorders 
we are developing protein drugs on our own behalf 
we have established a strategic alliance with abgenix  inc abgenix to develop antibody drugs across all diseases areas  and have established a strategic alliance with bayer ag bayer to develop small molecule drugs to treat obesity and adult onset diabetes 
we are currently pursuing additional alliances to develop small molecule drugs across other disease areas 
we were incorporated in november and  until march  were engaged primarily in organizational activities  research and development of our technologies  grant preparation and obtaining financing 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over the next 
table of contents several years as we focus our resources on prioritizing  selecting and rapidly advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
our ability to earn revenues and become profitable is dependent primarily on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products based upon our expertise in genomics  our technologies  and our drug discovery and development programs 
accomplishing this goal also depends in part on our ability to maintain our existing strategic alliances with abgenix and bayer  and on our ability to establish new alliances to aid us in developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics 
we cannot guarantee that any such strategic alliances  either new or existing  will be successful 
we have also established a majority owned subsidiary  corporation currently doing business as life sciences  to develop novel technologies for rapidly and comprehensively analyzing entire genomes 
we expect that will commercialize these products upon their development  which may be a future source of revenues for us 
our failure to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies and expertise are not expected for several years  if at all 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used in all dollar amounts in tabular presentations are shown in thousands 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and as such  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we have entered into certain collaborative research agreements that provide for the partial or complete funding of specified projects in exchange for access to  and certain rights in  the data discovered under the related projects 
revenue is recognized based upon defined metrics of completion that include percentage of completion milestones  and project specific initiatives as defined in each of the respective research plans 
the defined metrics are reviewed internally each month to determine the work performed and the appropriate revenue to be recognized 
we have also entered into a collaborative research exchange agreement in which services and technology access are exchanged between the collaborative partner and us 
revenues and expenses under this exchange agreement include the fair value of the work performed by each collaborative partner 
deferred revenue arising from payments received from collaborative research agreements is recognized as income when earned 
cash and investments we consider investments readily convertible into cash  with an original maturity of three months or less  to be cash equivalents 
investments with an original maturity greater than three months but less than one year are considered short term investments 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to their short maturity 
investments with an original maturity greater than one year are designated as marketable securities  are classified as available for sale securities  and are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
interest on debt securities  amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are included in interest income 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we regularly evaluate the recoverability of the net carrying value of our property  and intangible assets  when an indicator of impairment is present by comparing the carrying values to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows and fair value of the long lived asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows and its fair value 
the impairment write down would be the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these long lived assets 
a loss on impairment would be recognized by a charge to earnings 
patent application costs costs incurred in filing for patents are charged to operations  until such time as it is determined that the filing will be successful 
when it becomes evident with reasonable certainty that an application will be successful  the costs incurred in filing for patents will begin to be capitalized 
capitalized costs related to successful patent applications will be amortized over a period not to exceed twenty years or the remaining life of the patent  whichever is shorter  using the straight line method 
stock based compensation in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which was effective for us beginning january  sfas requires expanded disclosures of stock based compensation arrangements with employees and non employees and encourages but does not require compensation cost to be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded to employees 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas sfas 
sfas permits two additional transition methods for entities that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas became effective for financial statements issued after december  companies are permitted to continue to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instruments awarded 
we will continue to apply apb to our stock based compensation awards to employees 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the corresponding period in  reflecting our current business strategy to establish strategic research and development alliances with companies  rather than focusing on shorter term service based collaborations 
therefore  the decrease in collaboration revenue from to  was primarily due to the completion in of the service based collaborations with glaxosmithkline  inc gsk  hoffmann la roche inc 
and its affiliate  roche vitamins  inc roche and millennium pharmaceuticals  inc formerly cor therapeutics  inc 
millennium  which generated an aggregate of approximately million in collaboration revenue during the decrease in collaboration revenue was also a result of the progression of the bayer alliance during from the set up phase to the production phase  offset by additional revenue recognized from the abgenix strategic alliance 
revenues recorded in the twelve month period ended december  were primarily related to our collaborative agreements with abgenix  bayer  and genentech  inc genentech while the same period in primarily included revenue from our collaborative agreements with abgenix  bayer  gsk  millennium and roche 
revenue from each of abgenix and bayer accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal abgenix  bayer and gsk each accounted for or more of our total revenue in we expect that collaboration revenues will continue to decrease significantly compared to revenues  unless we receive royalties or milestone payments from products currently under development by our current and former collaborative partners 
we will continue to focus on the establishment of strategic research 
table of contents and development alliances with companies to gain access to expertise that is currently unavailable to us 
we expect these alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to provide us with access to unique technologies  access to capital  near term revenues  milestone and or royalty payments  and potential profit sharing arrangements 
future revenues will be dependent upon our ability to enter into additional alliances and collaborations  maintain and expand current collaborations  receive royalties and milestone payments from products currently under development by our current and former collaborators  successfully sell technologies being developed by and successfully develop and market products that may arise from our own internal drug development pipeline 
operating expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the increase of million  or  was primarily attributable to increased internal research efforts and our obligations to fulfill research requirements under existing collaborations and strategic alliances  which included payments for contractual services  increased equipment depreciation expense and additional personnel costs 
research and development expenses for are expected to decrease slightly in comparison to  reflecting the expected reduction in costs as a result of the recent corporate restructuring  partially offset by the expected increase in clinical trial costs and s increased operating expenses as its operations continue to expand 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to legal expenses in support of the development of our intellectual property portfolio and additional personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses for are expected to decrease slightly in comparison to  reflecting the recent corporate restructuring  including decreases in personnel costs  depreciation expense  consulting costs  and facility repairs and maintenance costs 
restructuring and related charges 
restructuring and related charges of approximately million were incurred in as a part of our restructuring plan which was intended to reduce costs and focus resources on prioritizing  selecting and rapidly advancing our most promising drug candidates 
as a result of the restructuring plan  our employee base was reduced by approximately personnel  representing approximately of our workforce 
the reduction in personnel included early stage drug discovery employees and general and administrative support positions 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we incurred million related to employee separation costs and million of asset impairment costs related to equipment no longer in service 
the employee separation costs were recorded under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and included amounts to be paid for severance and related benefits  the services for which had been performed in full as of the end of the cash requirements under the restructuring plan were million  of which million was paid prior to december  we expect to pay the majority of our remaining cash obligations related to the restructuring plan during the first quarter of and currently do not anticipate any additional restructuring plans 
also included in restructuring and related charges was an asset impairment of million  consisting of costs previously incurred in conjunction with the planned construction of a campus facility  including a new corporate headquarters and protein production facility in branford  connecticut 
plans to construct these facilities have been deferred indefinitely  pending improvements in the external financing environment  which would afford us the ability to finance the future construction costs 
interest income  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  of million decreased million  or  as compared to million for the same period in interest income for the year ended december  of million decreased million  or  as compared to million for the same period in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower yields in our investment portfolio and a decrease in cash and investment balances during we earned an average yield of in as compared to in the decrease in cash and investments during was primarily a result of 
table of contents operating losses in support of our research and development activities  acquisitions of additional property and equipment and payment of interest to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt which we issued on february  we anticipate that interest income in will continue to decrease significantly as compared to  as cash and investment balances are utilized in the normal course of operations and the yields in our investment portfolio continue to decrease slightly 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million represented a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was primarily attributable to accrued interest and interest paid to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt which we issued on february  we expect that interest expense will remain relatively constant in income tax benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded a connecticut income tax benefit of million  representing a decrease of million  as compared to a connecticut income tax benefit of million in the decrease in the income tax benefit was a result of the decline in various expenses which qualify for the annual research and development credit  primarily tax based compensation and consulting expenses resulting from the exercise of stock options by employees and non employees 
we recorded the income tax benefit as a result of connecticut legislation  which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual research and development expense credit  in exchange for forgoing carryforward of the credit 
we expect to record a connecticut income tax benefit during of significantly less than the amount  due to an anticipated reduction in qualified connecticut research and development expenses 
we determine our income taxes using the asset and liability method 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
as we have no prior earnings history  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to the deferred income tax assets has been established to reflect these uncertainties 
the increase in the valuation allowance was million for the year ended december  minority interest in subsidiary loss 
minority interest in subsidiary loss for the year ended december   which is the portion of s loss attributable to stockholders of other than us  was million as compared to million for the same period in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to s additional personnel costs  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation expense and payments for consulting and contractual services 
during  losses attributed to the minority ownership in are expected to continue to increase as compared to  as continues to make significant progress in developing new technologies

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and investments  compared to million as of december  the decrease of million in cash and investments during was primarily a result of additional operating losses in support of our research and development activities  acquisitions of additional property and equipment and payment of interest to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt issued in february we have financed our operations since inception primarily through public equity offerings  our convertible subordinated debt offering  revenues received under our collaborative research agreements  private placements of equity securities  government grants  and capital leases 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative sponsored research revenues from collaborative research agreements and government grants 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
our cash investing activities have consisted primarily of acquisitions of equipment and expenditures for leasehold improvements and net outflows from purchases and maturities of short term investments and marketable securities 
at december   our gross investment in lab and office equipment  computers  land and leasehold improvements was million 
at december   equipment with a gross book value of million secures our equipment financing loan facilities 
we had approximately million in material commitments for capital expenditures at december  in accordance with our investment policy  we are utilizing the following investment objectives for cash and investments investment decisions are made with the expectation of minimum risk of principal loss  even with a modest penalty in yield  appropriate cash balances and related short term funds are maintained for immediate liquidity needs  and appropriate liquidity is available for medium term cash needs  and maximum after tax yield is achieved 
cash flows for the year ended december  operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily due to the net cash loss from operations of million  increases in income taxes receivable of million and prepaid expenses of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million  offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of million  plus increases in accrued expenses of million and other current liabilities of million

future liquidity sources of liquidity 
during  we expect to fund our operations through a combination of the following sources cash and investment balances  collaboration revenue  gross interest income  and potential public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings 
uses of liquidity 
throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our emerging preclinical and clinical drug pipeline 
in that regard  we foresee the following as significant uses of liquidity salaries and benefits  supplies and reagents  contractual services  clinical trials on our recently approved protein therapeutic cg  legal expenses in support of the development of our intellectual property portfolio  and interest expense related to payments made to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt issued in february in addition  we anticipate that we will also incur additional capital expenditures in primarily for the 
table of contents purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements at our new haven and branford research facilities and administrative offices  including the expansion of our existing protein production laboratory 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december payments due year ended december  total and thereafter capital leases operating leases interest on convertible subordinated debt long term debt obligation total refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our long term debt obligation 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements through the end of our operating and capital expenditures are considered to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in research and development programs  we believe that we are building substantial value for our shareholders 
our future operating and capital requirements  and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the progress we make in our drug discovery  drug development  and pharmacogenomic programs  the magnitude of these programs  the success of our strategic research and development alliance partners in developing and commercializing drugs from existing programs and our ability to establish additional collaborative and licensing arrangements 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objectives of our long term business plan  which are to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of less than three months  of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year  and the remaining in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than one year and less than five years 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our cash and investments 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  consist of our convertible subordinated debentures due february  and capital lease obligations  both of which bear interest at fixed rates  therefore  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings would be affected by interest rate changes  at this point we do not anticipate any significant future borrowings  and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   the market value of our convertible subordinated debentures based on quoted market prices was estimated at million 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements
