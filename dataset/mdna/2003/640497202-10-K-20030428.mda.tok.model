item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when used in this discussion  the words expects  anticipates  believes and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect management s current intentions and expectations 
however  actual events and results could vary significantly based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to customer acceptance of new neomagic products  the market acceptance of handheld system products developed and marketed by customers that use the company s products  the company s ability to execute product and technology development plans on schedule  and the company s ability to access advanced manufacturing technologies in sufficient capacity without significant cash pre payments or investment 
these factors along with those set forth below under factors that may affect results  are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date hereof 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein  to reflect any changes in the company s expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based 
note for a more complete understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and some of the risks that could affect future results  see risks that could affect future results 
this section should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates neomagic s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenue and expenses and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies discussed below  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets neomagic has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet  including other purchased intangibles related to acquisitions 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  the company must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
assumptions about future revenue and cash flows require significant judgment because of the current state of the economy  the fluctuation of actual revenue  and the timing of expenses 
as a result of adopting statement of accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on february   the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
instead  goodwill was reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas and again in the third quarter of fiscal because indicators of impairment were present 
in addition  on adoption of sfas  the company reclassified certain intangibles with net book value million  consisting of assembled workforce and acquisition costs  which are no longer defined as an acquired intangible under sfas  to goodwill 
accordingly  there was no amortization of assembled workforce and acquisition costs recognized during fiscal upon adoption of sfas  the company was required to complete the two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
the company completed step one of the transitional impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that there were indicators of impairment  as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value derived from the market capitalization model 
the second step of the transitional impairment test to determine the amount of impairment was completed in the third quarter of fiscal by comparing fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the results of the second transitional impairment test  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  to reduce the carrying value of its goodwill  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for goodwill  the annual impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the unit s carrying value  then an additional analysis is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if that unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities is less than the carrying value of the unit s goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
similarly  the impairment evaluation for indefinite life intangible assets includes a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the company 
for such assets  in each reporting period  the company also evaluates whether events and circumstances continue to support the use of an indefinite useful life 
if it is determined that the circumstances have changed and the intangible asset is determined to have a finite useful life  the asset will be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
intangible assets are carried and reported at acquisition cost  net of accumulated amortization subsequent to acquisition 
the acquisition cost is amortized over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
changes in circumstances such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to the company s business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  the company will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments  or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives of intangible assets 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable  or at least annually  in accordance with sfas the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
during fiscal  the company wrote off licensed intangible properties with a net book value of million relating to licensed intellectual property that will no longer be used 
during fiscal  the company determined that certain intangible assets purchased as part of the linkup systems corporation acquisition completed in december were impaired and recorded a total impairment charge of  thousand 
see impairment of certain acquired intangible assets section below for further discussion of the impairment charge 
inventory valuation the company s inventory valuation policy stipulates that at the end of each reporting period we write down or write off our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the amount of the write down or write off is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the inventory based upon reasonable assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or write offs may be required 
additionally  as we introduce product enhancements and new products  demand for our existing products in inventory may decrease 
in the first quarter of fiscal  consistent with this policy  we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete write downs related to restructuring the business 
in the future  we may find that similar assessments may warrant another write down or write off of inventory 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the products are shipped to customers  other than distributors  title has transferred  and no significant obligations remain 
in addition  the company requires the following i execution of a written customer order  ii delivery of the product  iii fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the proceeds is probable 
the company s shipment terms are fob shipping point 
with respect to products shipped to distributors  the company generally defers recognition of product revenue until the distributors sell its products to their customers 
on occasion  however  the company will sell products with end of life status to its distributors under special arrangements without any price protection or return privileges for which the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title  based on shipping terms 
at the end of each accounting period  the company makes a determination of certain factors including sales returns and allowances  which could affect the amount of revenue recorded for the period 
sales returns provisions include considerations for known but unprocessed sales returns and estimation for unknown returns based on historical experiences 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income  the company has fully reserved its deferred tax assets 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period when such determination was made 
the company has also provided for certain potential tax liabilities 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period when the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
overview neomagic designs  develops  manufactures and sells high performance applications processors for handheld systems  offering low power  small form factor  and enabling multimedia features and applications 
in the past  the company provided semiconductor solutions for the notebook pc multimedia accelerator marketplace 
in april  the company began to exit this market and is now focused solely on developing  manufacturing and selling applications processors and companion chips for the handheld systems market 
the company is now generating revenues from this new product effort 
in fiscal  the company expects to see customers introducing new handheld systems that use the company s chips  primarily in europe and asia 
the company also expects to launch additional new members of its mimagic family of applications processors in fiscal neomagic has established strategic relationships with third party manufacturing partners to produce semiconductor products for the company 
pursuant to these strategic relationships  neomagic designs the overall product  including the logic and analog circuitry  and the manufacturing partners manufacture the wafers  perform testing and package the products 
neomagic is focused on leveraging its core competencies in integrating logic  analog and memory  along with graphics  video  d and other multimedia technologies  drivers  middleware and operating system software  and power management in its continued development of solutions that facilitate the mobilization of multimedia applications 
neomagic introduced the mimagic applications processor nms in november  and began sampling the product in february the company expects to start revenue shipments in the latter half of fiscal with significant revenues not expected to be generated until fiscal in november of  the company introduced a new technology platform  called associative processor array apa 
the apa architecture uses a massively parallel approach to processing information  which means that apa operates on more data in parallel with each tick of the clock 
existing solutions use a sequential processing flow that typically implies operation on each individual data element in sequence  making use of ever faster clocks to gain performance 
with its ability to handle large amounts of data simultaneously and at lower clock rates  the apa platform is targeted at multimedia data such as images  video and graphics 
the company anticipates that it will introduce products based on the apa architecture in the first half of fiscal these products are not expected to generate significant revenues during fiscal year the company s fiscal year generally consists of a fifty two week period ending on the sunday closest to the january month end 
fiscal year ended on january  fiscal year ended on january  fiscal ended on january  for convenience  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented as ending on the last day of the january calendar month

the company s historical products were used in the personal computer industry with sales primarily in asia and the united states 
net sales were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in sales in fiscal was due to sales of the company s new products 
the substantial decrease in sales from fiscal to fiscal is due to the company ending its notebook multimedia product line and changing its focus to efforts on developing application processors for the handheld systems marketplace 
the sales in fiscal year were primarily comprised of residual orders for the company s legacy multimedia accelerator products 
the company expects that the percentage of its net sales represented by any one product or type of product may change significantly from period to period when new products are introduced and existing products reach the end of their product life cycles 
the company expects that net sales  for fiscal will increase from fiscal due to increased revenue from its mimagic application processor family 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states  and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net sales  although there can be no assurance that export sales as a percentage of net sales will remain at current levels 
all sales transactions were denominated in united states dollars 
four customers accounted for    and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal two customers accounted for and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal four customers accounted for    and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company expects a significant portion of its future sales to remain concentrated with a limited number of strategic customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain its strategic customers 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the occurrence of any such events or the loss of a strategic customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and the timing of the company s new product introduction 
gross margin gross margin loss was million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
cost of sales includes amortization of deferred compensation of  in fiscal there was no amortization of deferred compensation in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  the company had minimal levels of sales of residual legacy notebook multimedia product inventories  which were fully reserved when the company exited this market 
the negative gross margin in fiscal is due to under absorption of manufacturing overhead resulting from low production levels and amortization and impairment charges of acquired developed technology 
fiscal gross margin includes excess and obsolete write downs of million  a lower of cost or market adjustment of million  and cancellation penalties to our manufacturing partners of million related to restructuring the business in the first quarter of fiscal in the future  the company s gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold  timing of volume shipments of new products  the availability and cost of products from the company s suppliers  and manufacturing yields particularly on new products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include compensation and associated costs relating to development personnel  operating system software costs and prototyping costs  which are comprised of photomask costs and pre production wafer costs 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the company has made  and intends to continue to make  significant investments in research and development to remain competitive by developing new and enhanced products to serve its identified markets 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to lower deferred compensation amortization and lower outside consulting costs offset somewhat by higher labor costs  higher software license and maintenance costs  and increased amortization of acquired and licensed intangibles relating to development of products  which are in the research and development stage 
included in the research and development expenses for fiscal was a charge of million to write off certain licensed intellectual property 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal  primarily because of lower labor costs due to lower average headcount offset somewhat by higher photomask costs associated with the company s new product development effort in the handheld systems market 
research and development expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal due to continuing cost reduction efforts 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these expenses include amortization of deferred compensation of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal due to increased sales expenses related to the company s new product efforts for the handheld systems market as well as increased amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the acquisition of linkup systems in december sales  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to lower labor costs resulting from decreased headcount and due to lower outside commissions on substantially lower sales 
sales  general and administrative expenses are expected to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal due to continuing cost reduction efforts 
special charge in january  the company extended its wafer supply agreement with infineon technologies ag of germany infineon through fiscal to ensure future wafer supply for the company s new product efforts 
the terms of the agreement provided that neomagic would make use of infineon s micron and micron embedded dram edram process technologies 
the agreement also provided for access to additional capacity and to more advanced process technologies to be developed by infineon 
neomagic provided million in guarantees towards its wafer purchases over the term of the agreement 
the amount of guarantee was included as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet  as of january  due to uncertainties over infineon s continued edram product development  the company decided not to use infineon s edram technology for its future production 
based on negotiations between neomagic and infineon on restructuring the wafer supply agreement with the intent to release neomagic from the related guarantee  the company recorded million in charges  which reflects the value of the final settlement in fiscal the million charge is composed of a million cash payment and the issuance of million in common stock 
these amounts are shown on the consolidated condensed statements of operations as a special charge for fiscal as a result of the settlement  million of restricted cash was released and reclassified to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet 
impairment of certain acquired intangible assets neomagic adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas  the company assesses the recoverability of its long lived assets by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets against their respective carrying amounts to determine whether impairment exists 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
during fiscal  the company determined that certain intangible assets purchased as part of the linkup systems corporation acquisition completed in december were impaired and recorded a total impairment charge of  thousand  during the period 
of the total impairment charge  thousand related to impairment of certain acquired intangibles that were capitalized relating to developed technology 
the impairment was caused by a decline in the related sales forecasts of products associated with the intangibles 
the impairment charge relating to developed technology is included in the cost of sales section of the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company also recorded a thousand impairment charge with respect to intangibles relating to customer relationships 
several key customers with whom the company was engaged have abandoned their related product plans  which led to the impairment 
the company also recorded a thousand impairment charge with respect to intangibles that were capitalized as internal use software 
the company no longer uses the software 
the impairment charge relating to customer relationships and internal use software is included in the operating expenses section of the consolidated statements of operations 
acquired in process research and development the company incurred approximately million of charges in fiscal for acquired in process research and development iprd in connection with the acquisition of linkup in december as of the date of acquisition  iprd has no alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
the amount allocated to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows from each of the technologies under development to their net present value  at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
linkup s development efforts were in the l silicon product that will use the next generation arm technology 
linkup s development efforts were estimated to be approximately complete at the date of the acquisition 
neomagic introduced the mimagic applications processor nms in november  and began sampling the product in february income  net of expenses  from the sale of dvd assets in april  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  the company sold the principal assets of its dvd product group  primarily consisted of fixed assets and intangible assets to lsi logic buyer

sfas  goodwill and other intangibles assets  which required companies to discontinue the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life must be reviewed for impairment using a two step method upon adoption of sfas and annually thereafter  or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
upon adoption of sfas  the company was required to complete the two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
the company completed step one of the transitional impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal and determined that there were indicators of impairment  as the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value derived from the market capitalization model 
the second step of the transitional impairment test to determine the amount of impairment was completed in the third quarter of fiscal by comparing fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss

interest expense was thousand  thousand  and thousand in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is due to capital leases entered into in the latter part of fiscal the decrease in interest expense from fiscal to fiscal is due to the significant reduction of capital lease balances 
income taxes the company s effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal year  the tax benefit rate differed from the statutory rate due to an increase in the company s valuation allowance 
the benefit recorded was limited to current cash income tax refunds available 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets  which are currently fully reserved  depends on the company generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of such realization  the management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is required as of january  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments stems primarily from cash used for operating activities which includes a net loss of million offset by a tax refund of million and the reclassification of restricted cash of million to cash and cash equivalents as part of the wafer supply agreement settlement with infineon 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal was primarily from cash used in operating activities which includes a net loss of million and establishment of an irrevocable standby letter of credit in connection with the wafer supply agreement with infineon 
the million deposit to establish the letter of credit is shown on the company s consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash as of january  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in fiscal was primarily from cash from investing activities and from cash provided by operating activities 
cash from investing activities includes million in proceeds from the sale of the dvd product group offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
cash and cash equivalents used by operating activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  while cash and cash equivalents provided from operating activities was million in fiscal the cash used in operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to the net loss  an increase in inventory and a decrease in income tax payable  offset in part by the reclass of million from restricted cash to cash equivalents  an increase in accounts payable  non cash depreciation and amortization  deferred compensation amortization  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the cash used in operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from the company s deposit of million to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in accordance with the extension of its wafer supply agreement with infineon  a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable and in compensation and related benefits  partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable and in non cash depreciation and amortization and deferred compensation amortization charges 
the cash provided from operating activities in fiscal stems primarily from decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  offset in part by the net loss of million and decreases in accounts payable and income taxes payable 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal is primarily due to net maturities of short term investments and from proceeds from the sale of dvd assets partially offset by purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net maturities of short term investments partially offset by purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to net proceeds received on the sale of the dvd product group of million and net maturities of short term investments of million  partially offset by purchases of property  plant  equipment and intangibles 
continued operation of the company s business may require higher levels of capital equipment purchases  technology investments  foundry investments and other payments to secure manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of future investments will depend primarily on the level of the company s future revenues 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal is due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by payments on capital lease obligations

at january   the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company believes that it will not generate cash from operating activities over the upcoming twelve months  yet believes its current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will satisfy the company s projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months 
investments will continue in the company s new product development efforts in the handheld systems marketplace 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the rate of net sales  the timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs  the timing of any new product introductions  and market acceptance of the company s products 
the company expects that it may need to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in may  the company moved its principal headquarters to a new facility in santa clara  california  under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in april in january  the company entered into a second non cancelable operating lease for the building adjacent to its principal headquarters

the future minimum payments relating to the software leases  license agreement and the facility leases are included in the contractual obligations table below 
the company s warranty program provides for repair  replacement  or credit on defective parts returned within one year of shipment 
the company records a provision for estimated warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based on expected failure rates and expected cost to replace defective products 
due to low sales volume on the company s new products  warranty liabilities are not significant 
contractual obligations the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in thousands 
there after total contractual obligations operating leases       license agreements   capital leases    total contractual cash obligations     the company did not have significant open and committed purchase orders as of january  recent accounting pronouncements in july of  the fasb approved sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas no 
specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and  therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company does not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in november of  the fasb issued fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin no 
requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the company will apply the recognition provisions of fin no 
prospectively to guarantees  if any  issued after january  the disclosure provisions of fin no 
are effective for financial statements of the company s fiscal year see note of the consolidated financial statements for discussion of warranty reserves and note for discussion of infringement indemnification 
in november of  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in december of  fasb issued statement of financial standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require expanded and more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation 
this disclosure is required in the summary of significant accounting policies footnote or its equivalent in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for their stock based employee awards using the fair value method 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the company amortized the estimated fair value of the options to expense over the options vesting period  and the estimated fair value of purchases under the employee stock purchase plan is expensed in the year of purchase as well as the stock based employee compensation cost  net of related tax effects  that would have been included in the determination of net income if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards 
in january of  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the provisions of fin no 
 however  it does not believe as of january   that the company has any investment in variable interest entities 
impact of currency exchange rates in the past  the company has purchased wafers under contracts denominated in yen 
significant appreciation in the value of the yen relative to the value of the us dollar would make the wafers relatively more expensive to the company  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has in the past and may in the future enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize short term foreign currency fluctuation exposures related to these firm purchase commitments 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these instruments are based on the company s designation of such instruments as hedging transactions 
the criteria the company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include its effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
notwithstanding the measures the company has adopted  due to the unpredictability and volatility of currency exchange rates and currency controls  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience currency losses in the future  nor can the company predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
in fiscal all the company s payments to us suppliers were denominated in us dollars 
the company did not experience fluctuations during fiscal that negatively impacted the company s gross margin and results of operations due to limited foreign exchange activity during the year  as a result of the company exiting the notebook product market 
factors that may affect results we expect to continue to incur significant losses in fiscal the company has been incurring substantial losses as it invests heavily in new product development in advance of achieving significant customer sales 
this is expected to continue in fiscal year the company s ability to achieve cash flow breakeven is likely to depend on the success of its mimagic  which has recently been released  and the success of other products and technology still in development and scheduled for release in the second half of fiscal year however  even if the mimagic and subsequent products achieve widespread customer acceptance  the length of customer design in cycles would preclude significant product shipments in fiscal accordingly  even if these new products are successful  the company will incur significant additional losses in fiscal our annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate the company s quarterly and annual results of operations are affected by a variety of factors that could materially adversely affect net sales  gross margin and operating results 
these factors include  among others  the ability of the company to increase its customer base and its sales  the abilities of manufacturing subcontractors to make adequate and timely deliveries  access to advanced production process technologies from manufacturing subcontractors  recruiting and retaining employees including those with engineering expertise in new disciplines 
in particular  the company s new product development efforts and customer engagements in system on chip integration and supporting multimedia technologies such as mpeg streaming video represent new endeavors and consequently carry greater risks of successful and timely execution 
any one or more of these factors could result in the company failing to achieve its expectations as to future revenues and profits 
furthermore  the majority of the company s sales were historically made  and are expected to continue to be made  on the basis of purchase orders rather than pursuant to long term purchase agreements  which increases the difficulty of forecasting sales 
the company may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall  which could materially adversely affect quarterly operating results 
accordingly  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
our financial results could be affected by changes in accounting rules in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires us to perform impairment analysis on our long lived assets  other than goodwill  to be held and used  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas related to i the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used  and ii the measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
as sfas excludes goodwill  certain long lived assets may be subject to impairment charges sooner than they would have been recorded under sfas  which sfas replaces 
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of thousand and thousand  respectively  related to our long lived assets as a result of our sfas analysis 
if economic conditions in our industry continue to deteriorate and adversely affect our business  we could be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
refer to note  recent accounting pronouncements  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our financial results could be affected by potential changes in the accounting rules governing the recognition of stock based compensation expense 
we measure compensation expense for our employee stock plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in addition  we provide pro forma disclosures of our operating results in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method of accounting had been applied in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
had we accounted for our compensation expense under the fair value method of accounting prescribed by sfas  the charge would have been significant  totaling million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
currently  the us congress  the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board are considering changes to accounting rules concerning the recognition of stock option compensation expense 
if one or more of these proposals are implemented  we and other companies may be required to measure compensation expense using the fair value method  which would adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our income or increasing our losses by an amount equal to such stock option charges 
we have a limited customer base four customers accounted for   and  respectively of net sales in fiscal two customers accounted for and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal four customers accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company expects that a small number of customers will account for a substantial portion of its net sales for the foreseeable future 
furthermore  the majority of the company s sales was historically made  and is expected to continue to be made  on the basis of purchase orders rather than pursuant to long term purchase agreements 
as a result  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the decision of a single customer to cease using the company s products  or by a decline in the number of handheld systems sold by a single customer 
we may lose our customer base the company s products are designed to afford the handheld systems manufacturer significant advantages with respect to product performance  power consumption and size 
to the extent that other future developments in components or subassemblies incorporate one or more of the advantages offered by the company s products  the market demand for the company s products may be negatively impacted 
we face intense competition in our markets the market for applications processors is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
neomagic believes that the principal factors of competition in this market are imaging performance  price  features  power consumption  size and software support 
the ability of the company to compete successfully in the applications processor market depends on a number of factors including  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality and reliability  price  ramp of production of the company s products for particular system manufacturers  customer demand and acceptance of more sophisticated multimedia functionality on handheld systems  end user acceptance of the system manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products and general economic conditions 
the company s ability to compete in the future will also depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards and market trends 
unanticipated changes in market trends and industry standards could render the company s products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  the company could be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign its products or obtain license rights to technologies owned by third parties in order to ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to redesign its products or obtain the necessary third party licenses within the appropriate window of market demand 
if the company s products are not in compliance with prevailing market trends and industry standards for a significant period of time  the company could miss crucial oem odm design cycles  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
neomagic competes with both domestic and international companies  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company with which to pursue engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
the company s principal competitors include intel s strongarm and xscale product lines  st microsystem s nomadik line  certain of samsung s sc chips and texas instruments omap product line  as well as a number of vertically integrated electronics firms who are developing their own solutions 
neomagic may also face increased competition from new entrants into the handheld systems semiconductor market including companies currently at developmental stages 
neomagic has significant intellectual properties and historically demonstrated expertise in soc technology 
however  the inability of the company to produce timely new products for its market could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
some of the company s current and potential competitors operate their own manufacturing facilities 
since the company does not operate its own manufacturing facility and may from time to time make binding commitments to purchase products  it may not be able to reduce its costs and cycle time or adjust its production to meet changing demand as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
our products may be incompatible with evolving industry standards and market trends the company s ability to compete in the future will also depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards and market trends 
unanticipated changes in market trends and industry standards could render the company s products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers 
as a result  the company could be required to invest significant time and resources to redesign its products or obtain license rights to technologies owned by third parties in order to ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and market trends 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to redesign its products or obtain the necessary third party licenses within the appropriate window of market demand 
if the company s products are not in compliance with prevailing market trends and industry standards for a significant period of time  the company could miss crucial oem design cycles  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on new product development to meet rapid market and technological change the company is now focused on providing high performance semiconductor solutions for sale to original equipment manufacturers of handheld systems 
new product planning is primarily focused on integrated system on chip semiconductor products for handheld systems  and multimedia technologies for integration into such products  such as mpeg video compression  image processing  graphics  and audio technologies 
the company s future business  financial condition and results of operations will depend to a significant extent on its ability to develop new products that address these market opportunities 
as a result  the company believes that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the markets for handheld systems are emerging opportunities  characterized by rapidly changing infrastructure  evolving industry standards and uncertain average selling prices 
the company must anticipate the features and functionality that consumers and infrastructure providers will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of equipment manufacturers  price its products competitively and introduce the products to the market on a timely basis 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability to create or acquire intellectual property  the ability of strategic manufacturing partners to effectively design and implement the manufacture of new products  quality of new products  differentiation of new products from those of the company s competitors and market acceptance of the company s and its customers products 
there can be no assurance that the products the company expects to introduce will incorporate the features and functionality demanded by system manufacturers and consumers  will be successfully developed  or will be introduced within the appropriate window of market demand  nor can there be assurance that customers who utilize the company s semiconductor products will achieve the levels of market success with their own system products that they may project to the company 
because of the complexity of its products  the company has experienced delays from time to time in completing development and introduction of new products 
in addition  the company is now beginning production and continuing the development of new products in markets in which the company has little history 
in the event that there are delays in ramping production of current products  or in the completion of development of future products  including the products currently under development for introduction over the next to months  the company s potential future business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the time required for competitors to develop and introduce competing products may be shorter  manufacturing yields may be better  and production costs may be lower than those experienced by the company 
we depend on third party manufacturers to produce our products the company s products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
the company currently utilizes several foundries for wafer fabrication 
the company expects that  for the foreseeable future  some of its products will be manufactured by a single source 
since  in the company s experience  the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new wafer fabrication partner is at least months  and the estimated time for a foundry to switch to a new product line ranges from four to nine months  there may be no readily available alternative source of supply for specific products 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by the company s manufacturing partners  the failure of the company s manufacturing partners to dedicate adequate resources to the production of the company s products  or the financial instability of the company s manufacturing partners would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies by the company s manufacturing partner is unsuccessful  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
there are many other risks associated with the company s dependence upon third party manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality  manufacturing yields and cost  the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on wafers supplied to the company  and potential misappropriation of neomagic s intellectual property 
the company is dependent on its manufacturing partners to produce wafers with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields  deliver those wafers on a timely basis to the company s third party assembly subcontractors and to allocate to the company a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet the company s needs 
although the company s products are designed using the process design rules of the particular manufacturer  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will be able to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturing partners will continue to devote adequate resources to the production of the company s products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of the company s products are based 
we rely on third party subcontractors to assemble and test our products the company s products are assembled and tested by third party subcontractors 
the company does not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
such assembly and testing is conducted on a purchase order basis 
as a result of its reliance on third party subcontractors to assemble and test its products  the company cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacturing or assembly of the company s products 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors  product shipments could be delayed significantly if the company were required to find alternative subcontractors 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of the assembly and test of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may encounter inventory excess or shortage the company has wafer supply relationships with several foundries to support the company s product efforts 
normally  the company places binding purchase orders two to three months prior to wafer shipment 
the company orders wafers for deliveries in advance and with the additional time to assemble and test wafers  the company can have orders for finished goods that will not be available for up to four months into the future 
if the company does not have sufficient demand for its products and cannot cancel its current and future commitments without material impact  the company may experience excess inventory  which will result in a write off affecting gross margin and results of operations 
if the company cancels a purchase order  it must pay cancellation penalties based on the status of work in process or the proximity of the cancellation to the delivery date 
the company must place purchase orders for wafers before it receives purchase orders from its own customers 
this limits the company s ability to react to fluctuations in demand for its products  which can be unexpected and dramatic  and from time to time will cause the company to have an excess or shortage of wafers for a particular product 
as a result of the long lead time for manufacturing wafers and the increase in just in time ordering by manufacturers  semiconductor companies such as the company from time to time must take charges for excess inventory 
the company did in fact incur such charges in fiscal of million 
significant write offs of excess inventory have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  failure to order sufficient wafers would cause the company to miss revenue opportunities and  if significant  could impact sales by the company s customers  which could adversely affect the company s customer relationships and thereby materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our manufacturing yields may fluctuate the fabrication of semiconductors is an extremely complex process  which typically includes hundreds of process steps 
minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  utilization of equipment with variations and numerous other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
as a result  semiconductor companies often experience problems in achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  which are represented by the number of good die as a proportion of the total number of die on any particular wafer 
the company often purchases wafers  not die  and pays an agreed upon price for wafers meeting certain acceptance criteria 
accordingly  the company bears the risk of the yield of good die from wafers purchased meeting the acceptance criteria 
the company experienced such yield problems in fiscal  which materially adversely affected the company s net sales  gross margins and results of operations in fiscal and semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both product design  which is developed largely by the company  and process technology  which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
historically  the company has experienced lower yields on new products 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between the company and the manufacturer 
this risk is compounded by the offshore location of the company s manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required identifying  communicating and resolving manufacturing yield problems 
as the company s relationships with new manufacturing partners develop  yields could be adversely affected due to difficulties associated with adopting the company s technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of each manufacturer 
any significant decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in the company s per unit product cost and could force the company to allocate its available product supply among its customers  potentially adversely impacting customer relationships as well as revenues and gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company s manufacturers will achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
uncertainty and litigation risk associated with patents and protection of proprietary rights the company relies in part on patents to protect its intellectual property 
as of january   the company has been issued patents  each covering certain aspects of the design and architecture of the company s products 
additionally  the company has numerous patent applications pending 
there can be no assurance that the company s pending patent applications  or any future applications will be approved 
further  there can be no assurance that any issued patents will provide the company with significant intellectual property protection  competitive advantages  or will not be challenged by third parties  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on the company s ability to do business 
in addition  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate the company s products or design around any patents that may be issued to the company 
the company also relies on a combination of mask work protection  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect its intellectual property 
despite these efforts  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to the company s trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that the company can meaningfully protect its intellectual property 
a failure by the company to meaningfully protect its intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a general matter  the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation  regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in december  the company filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware seeking damages and an injunction against trident microsystems  inc the suit alleges that trident s embedded dram graphics accelerators infringe certain patents held by the company 
in january  trident filed a counter claim against the company alleging an attempted monopolization in violation of antitrust laws  arising from neomagic s filing of the patent infringement action against trident 
the court ruled that there was no infringement by trident 
the company filed an appeal in the united states court of appeals  for the federal circuit 
on april   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the lower court s judgment of non infringement on one patent and vacated the courts judgment of non infringement on another patent  thereby remanding it to the lower court for further proceedings 
in november  the lower court heard oral arguments on cross motions for summary judgment on the matter  and we are currently awaiting its ruling 
management believes the company has valid defenses against trident s claims 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the patent infringement suit and the counter suit for antitrust filed by trident 
any patent litigation  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that current or future infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by other customers or end users of the company s products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes  or to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance  however  that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on international sales and suppliers export sales have been a critical part of the company s business 
sales to customers located outside the united states including sales to the foreign operations of customers with headquarters in the united states and foreign system manufacturers that sell to united states based oems accounted for  and of the company s net sales for fiscal   and  respectively 
the company expects that net sales derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales 
letters of credit issued by customers have supported a portion of the company s international sales 
to date  the company s international sales have been denominated in united states dollars 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency of the company s customers could make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products sold in the customer s local currency 
international manufacturers have produced  and are expected to continue to produce for the foreseeable future  all of the company s wafers 
in addition  many of the assembly and test services used by the company are procured from international sources 
wafers are priced in us dollars under the company s purchase orders with its manufacturing suppliers 
international sales and manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences and export license requirements 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally including foreign government regulation  political and economic instability  and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
moreover  the laws of certain foreign countries in which the company s products may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  thus increasing the possibility of piracy of the company s products and intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these risks will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements through the next months  although the company could be required  or could elect  to seek to raise additional capital in the future 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of net sales growth  timing and extent of spending to support research and development programs in new and existing areas of technology  expansion of sales and marketing support activities  and timing and customer acceptance of new products 
the company may raise additional equity or debt financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we are dependent on qualified personnel the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  finance and executive personnel  and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business 
the company has experienced the loss of certain key personnel and also reduced personnel in its restructuring 
if the company s headcount is not appropriate for its future direction and the company fails to recruit key personnel critical to its future direction in a timely manner  it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other semiconductor companies  has been and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors  including quarter to quarter variations in the company s anticipated or actual operating results  announcements of new products  technological innovations or setbacks by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor and pc industries  unanticipated shifts in the handheld systems market or industry standards  loss of key customers  changes in dram pricing  litigation commencement or developments  changes in or the failure by the company to meet estimates of the company s performance by securities analysts  market conditions for high technology stocks in general  and other events or factors 
in future quarters  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
since the company s decline in revenues  gross margins and operating results  the market price of the common stock has been and is expected to be for some time in the future  materially adversely affected 
there may not be an active  liquid trading market for our common stock 
for several weeks in october  our common stock traded below the minimum bid price requirement of the nasdaq national market 
if we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  including the minimum bid price per share requirement  we may be delisted from trading on such market  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the nasdaq small cap market  the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of the national association of securities dealers  inc there is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the nasdaq national market 
you may not be able to sell your shares quickly  at the market price or at all if trading in our stock is not active
