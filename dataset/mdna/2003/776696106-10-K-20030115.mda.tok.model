item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selection financial information and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
within this annual report  we have provided pro forma sales and sales orders information 
this pro forma information is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and does not conform to the pro forma information presented in our consolidated financial statements 
we present this pro forma information because management believes that the information illustrates the impact of acquisitions on our performance 
for the purposes of calculating pro forma net sales  net sales orders and sales order backlog information  we have added sales and sales order information of each company that roper has acquired during one of the two periods being compared to the appropriate period  so that the acquired company s results are included for the same number of months for both periods 
further  pro forma net sales  net sales orders and sales order backlog information exclude amounts attributable to discontinued or divested operations for the period presented 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended october  included elsewhere in this annual report 
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results  such as determining inventory cost  depreciating long lived assets  recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees 
we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements  except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed below 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management 
our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec 
although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable  others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available 
if an accounting estimate changes  its effects are accounted for prospectively 
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility  inventory utilization  future warranty obligations  revenue recognition percent of completion  income taxes and goodwill analysis 
these issues  except for income taxes  which are not allocated to our business segments  affect each of our business segments 
these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience  current conditions and relatively short term forecasting 
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products  including in certain cases  credits for returned products 
accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms  whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences  what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers 
the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits 
at october   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and sales credits was million  or of total gross accounts receivable excluding securitized gazprom receivables from a vendor financing program 
this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables 
during  that profile improved with the acquisition of zetec and other improvements in collections from core businesses  and the allowance was reduced as a percent of net sales by basis points 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage  which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
when we use historical usage  this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances 
at october   inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  or of gross first in  first out inventory cost 
this percentage has increased by basis points over the year as the relative age of inventory increased during the cyclical downturn 
most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale  typically months 
future warranty obligations are evaluated using  among other factors  historical cost experience  product evolution and customer feedback 
at october   the accrual for future warranty obligations was million or of proforma sales 
our expense for warranty obligations was less than of net sales for each of the three years ended october  revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project 
during fiscal  and  we recognized revenue of approximately million  million and million  respectively using this method 
in addition  approximately million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized at october  contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
during fiscal  our effective income tax rate was reduced to from 
two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits and the accounting change related to goodwill amortization that was expensed for book purposes prior to the adoption of sfas but not deductible for income tax purposes 
we adopted sfas no 
effective november  the beginning of our fiscal sfas  issued in june  requires the adoption of its provisions by the beginning of our fiscal  but the timing of our fiscal year end also allowed it to elect to adopt sfas at the beginning of fiscal based primarily on investor interest to see results reflecting adoption of sfas  we elected to adopt this new standard at the earlier date 
the evaluation of goodwill under sfas requires valuations of each applicable underlying business 
these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time  market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets 
these estimates will likely change over time 
some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
the transitional business valuation reviews required by sfas indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units in the analytical instrumentation and industrial controls segments 
this goodwill reduction has been reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of fiscal and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately million 
after the adoption of sfas  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually 
if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances  that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations 
our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect to continue with future acquisitions 
prior to adopting sfas  goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding years 
with the adoption of this standard  goodwill is not amortized 
it is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above 
sfas does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption 
therefore  earnings beginning in fiscal tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change  except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented 
goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of sfas was largest in the analytical instrumentation segment and the amount of goodwill currently recorded is also largest for this segment 
we believe it inappropriate to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment 
at october   roper s total assets included million of goodwill 
goodwill was allocated million to our analytical instrumentation segment  million to our fluid handling segment and million to our industrial controls segment 
total goodwill was allocated to different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than million to approximately million 
results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated 
dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales 
year ended october  net sales analytical instrumentation    fluid handling    industrial controls    total    gross profit analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls total operating profit analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls total operating profit goodwill amortization corporate administrative expenses restructuring charges income from operations interest expense euro debt currency exchange loss other income earnings before income taxes and change in accounting principle income taxes goodwill adjustment effective november   net of taxes net earnings includes results of antek instruments from august  struers and logitech from september and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented

restructuring charges were   and  in industrial controls  fluid handling and analytical instrumentation  respectively 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal were million  a increase compared to fiscal  and a decrease on a pro forma basis compared to fiscal the increase over prior year is attributable to the inclusion of full year sales from struers and logitech  which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as sales from the acquisition of zetec in the fourth quarter of fiscal these sales increases were offset by exiting certain petrotech businesses and sales declines in other businesses due to widespread weak economic conditions 
the decrease compared to pro forma net sales is primarily attributable to exiting of certain petrotech businesses  continued declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets 
the impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a increase in sales to gazprom and an increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products 
in our analytical instrumentation segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales decreased 
the increase in actual net sales resulted principally from the contribution of acquisitions and increased sales in our fluid properties testing businesses 
this was offset by lower sales into semiconductor markets and lower motion product sales by redlake due to the pending release of a new generation of products that we anticipate to begin shipping during the first half of fiscal in our fluid handling segment  net sales declined compared to fiscal primarily from the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market and weakness in industrial and oil gas exploration markets 
in our industrial controls segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales were roughly flat with fiscal actual net sales increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of zetec and gains from certain oil gas control system applications  particularly those sold to gazprom  partly reduced by lower sales from exiting certain petrotech businesses in fiscal the increase in our overall gross profit percentage to in fiscal compared to to in fiscal was mostly due to exiting low margin businesses at petrotech 
this also caused an increase in margins for the industrial controls segment to in fiscal compared to in fiscal analytical instrumentation gross margins were roughly flat at in fiscal compared to in fiscal fluid handling s gross margins decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was caused mostly by adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses 
excluding the effects from the accounting change related to goodwill and the restructuring charges expensed in fiscal  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to higher sg a expense levels at newly acquired businesses 
sg a expenses for companies included in all of both and declined in despite significantly increased r d and other engineering expenses at some of our digital imaging companies 
this spending was most notable at redlake masd as it continues to develop new products it expects to be available in the second quarter of fiscal there was also an increase in corporate sg a due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses also increased in compared to for each of our three business segments by between and 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  average borrowing levels were approximately higher during fiscal compared to the prior year and effective interest rates were approximately lower during fiscal compared to fiscal higher borrowing levels in fiscal were primarily from the september acquisition of struers and logitech and the july acquisition of zetec 
a euro debt foreign exchange loss of million arose from euro denominated debt that was carried in the us and the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during the third quarter of fiscal this debt matured near july  and was replaced with us dollar denominated debt 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with european tax structures 
during fiscal  we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under sfas as of november  this review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value 
if an impairment was indicated  the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
this impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle  was a non cash charge and was related to the redlake  petrotech and dynamco units 
at october   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october  this strengthening resulted in a gain of million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal approximately million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows 
fiscal s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non us currencies 
the benefits were less than of operating earnings 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal s financial information 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended october dollar amounts in thousands 
pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     total     our fluid handling segment was more exposed to poor semiconductor conditions than the other two segments 
semiconductor related sales orders were down significantly in fiscal compared to fiscal excluding this business  fluid handling s net sales orders decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in analytical instrumentation net sales orders was attributed to weak semiconductor  electronics and automotive markets that more than offset the increase in fluid properties testing 
aside from the semiconductor decline  the fluid handling segment decline in net sales orders also reflected the weak oil and gas exploration and power generation markets 
a one time supplemental order of million from gazprom in fiscal caused unfavorable comparisons in the industrial controls segment 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at october dollar amounts in thousands 
pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     total     a significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at october  compared to october  was the million residual one time supplemental gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for industrial controls 
excluding this order  backlog is up 
declines in analytical instrumentation and fluid handling were attributable to weak electronics and oil exploration markets  respectively 
year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal were million  a increase compared to fiscal excluding sales to gazprom  net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal pro forma net sales increased compared to pro forma net sales during fiscal in our analytical instrumentation segment  actual net sales increased in fiscal and pro forma net sales increased 
the increase in actual net sales resulted mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal and the increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong digital imaging demand from research markets 
weakness in the automobile industry adversely affected sales of our high speed digital camera products and our industrial leak test products 
in our fluid handling segment  actual net sales increased in fiscal and pro forma net sales decreased 
actual net sales increased primarily as the result of companies acquired during fiscal and pro forma net sales decreased primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
this segment s pro forma net sales to this industry decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal for this segment s businesses not serving the semiconductor industry increased compared to pro forma net sales in fiscal in our industrial controls segment  actual net sales increased and pro forma net sales increased 
actual net sales increased primarily as a result of companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal  increased shipments to gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues at petrotech that resulted from restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal pro forma net sales increased primarily as a result of additional sales to gazprom 
sales to gazprom were million during fiscal  or an increase of compared to fiscal our overall gross profit percentage increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal several factors were the largest contributors to the change 
the largest factor was the growth in our analytical instrumentation segment  the highest gross margin segment 
other large factors contributing to increased margins were improved leverage on the additional sales to gazprom and the benefits from exiting certain low margin businesses at petrotech during increased sales from our lower margin refrigeration valves business that was acquired in september adversely affected margins 
analytical instrumentation s gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal most of this improvement resulted from favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the incremental sales at struers and logitech that were at relatively high margins 
fluid handling s gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high margin semiconductor related products 
industrial controls gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased sales to gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses  and was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin refrigeration valve products 
sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal and fiscal are presented in the following table 
total adjusted total adjusted analytical instrumentation fluid handling industrial controls corporate total excludes goodwill amortization for fiscal and and restructuring charges included in fiscal the increase in sg a costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal for the fluid handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segment s semiconductor related business 
other changes in the relationships between sg a costs and net sales were not considered significant 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense was higher in fiscal mostly due to the borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions  representing total costs of over million during these two fiscal years  were paid for with cash provided by our then existing credit facilities 
short term interest rates started to decline dramatically early in calendar the effective interest rate was approximately during fiscal compared to approximately during fiscal the provision for income taxes was of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal this change was not considered significant 
the other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these net assets were primarily denominated in euros  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
during fiscal  the us dollar weakened against the euro  was relatively stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone after the acquisition of danish assets in september 
during fiscal  our consolidated net assets increased million due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
the following table summarizes net sales order information for the years ended october dollar amounts in thousands 
pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     total     the decrease in analytical instrumentation s pro forma net sales orders in fiscal compared to fiscal was broad based 
net sales orders for each major product group declined from 
this segment s businesses were adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor industries 
the decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the fluid handling segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductor related orders 
the increase in pro forma net sales orders for the industrial controls segment was caused primarily by additional orders from gazprom 
the following table summarizes our sales order backlog information at october dollar amounts in thousands 
pro forma pro forma actual pro forma actual change analytical instrumentation     fluid handling     industrial controls     total     changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million during fiscal most of this decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributed to the one time supplemental order for gazprom  partially offset by improved cash generation from assets 
cash flows from investing activities during each of fiscal   and were mostly business acquisition costs 
cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were mostly the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows 
financing activities in fiscal also included refinancing our then existing million credit agreement with our current million credit facility and the issuance of million of senior notes 
total current assets  excluding cash  exceeded total current liabilities  excluding debt  by million at october  compared to million at october  we acquired approximately million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal we also financed a million one time supplemental order for gazprom 
working capital was otherwise reduced by approximately million during fiscal due to improved management of our accounts receivable  inventories and payables 
total debt was million at october  of total capital compared to million at october  of total capital 
our increased debt at october  compared to that a year ago was due to the borrowings incurred to fund fiscal business acquisitions in excess of cash generated by existing operations 
our principal million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of our daily external financing requirements  consisting of revolving loans  swing line loans and letters of credit 
at october   utilization of this facility included million of us denominated borrowings  the equivalent of million of non us denominated borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit 
total unused availability under this facility was million at october  we expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions 
this facility matures may we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non us businesses 
in total  these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 
our outstanding indebtedness at october  also included million of term notes maturing in may and may and do not require sinking fund payments 
we may prepay the notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of basis points plus the yield of the us treasury notes corresponding to the then remaining average life of the notes being prepaid 
capital expenditures of million  million and million were incurred during fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be comparable as a percentage of sales to the past two years 
in november  roper s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to per share from per share  an increase of 
this represents the tenth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper s initial public offering 
our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on january  payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at october  dollars in thousands 
payments due in fiscal contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt      operating leases        total        amounts expiring in fiscal total other commercial amount commitments committed thereafter standby letters of credit   total   at october  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although we maintain an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities  financial condition and results of operations 
we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 
we anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which has historically been experienced 
however  the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies  and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 
recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations that roper is required to adopt by november  roper does not currently have  nor is it expected to have  any material asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard 
the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets that roper is required to adopt by november  this new standard does not apply to goodwill 
roper does not expect the adoption of this standard to result in an impairment charge 
the fasb issued sfas that rescinded  amended or made technical corrections to several previously issued statements 
none of these changes are expected to significantly affect roper s accounting or financial reporting practices 
the fasb issued sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities that roper is required to adopt for applicable transactions after december  this standard modifies the timing of when certain costs are reported 
outlook we currently expect sales and net income for fiscal to be higher than for fiscal fiscal is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from the businesses acquired during fiscal  especially zetec  from additional efforts to make our companies more efficient  and from reduced interest expense resulting from paying down our debt 
the conditions in the semiconductor industry are currently poor and we do not expect any meaningful recovery in this industry during fiscal the overall economic conditions of the usa and europe are sluggish and both the federal reserve board and the european central bank recently lowered discount rates yet again in an effort to stimulate the respective economies 
there continue to be terrorist threats against the us and its allies and also the possibility of military action against iraq 
a significant terrorist attack or military action against iraq could cause changes in world economies that would adversely affect us 
it is impossible to isolate each of these factor s effects on current economic conditions 
it is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy 
we expect to continue an active acquisition program 
however  completion of future acquisitions and their impact on ours results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted 
information about forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
in addition  we  or our executive officers on our behalf  may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press  potential investors or others 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include statements preceded by  followed by or that include the words  believes  expects  anticipates  plans  estimates or similar expressions 
these statements include  among others  statements regarding our expected business outlook  anticipated financial and operating results  strategies  contingencies  financing plans  working capital needs  sources of liquidity  capital expenditures and contemplated acquisitions 
forward looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance 
these statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of our management  which in turn are based on currently available information 
important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include  among others  assumptions regarding demand for our products  expected pricing levels  parts and components costs  the timing and cost of planned capital expenditures  the estimated cost of environmental compliance  expected outcomes of pending litigation  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
these assumptions could prove inaccurate 
the forward looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
such factors include  but are not limited to  the following o reductions in our business with gazprom  o unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  o difficulties associated with exports  o risks associated with our international operations  o difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses  o increased product liability and insurance costs o increased warranty exposure  o the fact that our former independent auditors  arthur andersen llp has ceased operations as described in the notice filed as exhibit to this annual report  o future competition  o changes in the supply of  or price for  parts and components  o environmental compliance costs and liabilities  o risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation  o potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets  and o the factors discussed in exhibit to this annual report under the heading risk factors 
we believe these forward looking statements are reasonable  however  undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements  which are based on current expectations 
further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 
at october   we had a combination of fixed rate borrowings primarily million of term notes and relatively variable rate borrowings primarily borrowings under the million credit facility 
although each borrowing under the million credit facility has a fixed rate  the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only months 
at october   prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes by percentage points 
this resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at october  there was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of million at october  if interest rates had been higher at october   the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have been approximately million smaller 
these interest rate differences do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
at october   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings under the million credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our annualized interest costs by million 
several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of our total sales and of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency 
the us dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal and was relatively stable compared to other currencies 
the difference between fiscal s operating results for these companies translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal was not material 
if these currency exchange rates had been different throughout fiscal compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced  the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately million 
the changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during fiscal compared to currency exchange rates at october  resulted in an increase in net assets of million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings  million of which was attributed to goodwill 
goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
the trading price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share 
the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock 
we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable
