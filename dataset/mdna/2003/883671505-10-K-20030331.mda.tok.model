business segments our subsidiaries have separate management teams and infrastructures and operate in two reportable operating segments retail and manufacturing

manufacturing 
our manufacturing segment consists of our subsidiary that manufactures and sells vinyl replacement windows to one of our retail companies and to unaffiliated customers

you should refer to footnote to our financial statements for the year ended december   which appears on page of this form k for additional financial information about each of our business segments 
management s discussion of critical accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical in understanding the company s financial statements because their application places the most demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its goodwill and other long term assets for impairment and assesses their recoverability based upon anticipated future cash flows 
if facts and circumstances lead the company s management to believe that the cost of one of its assets may be impaired  the company will a evaluate the extent to which that cost is recoverable by comparing the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount and b write down that carrying amount to market value or discounted cash flow value to the extent necessary 
revenue and cost recognition the company recognizes revenues from fixed price contracts on the completed contract method since the contracts are of a short duration 
a contract is considered complete when the home improvement product has been installed 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor and supplies 
general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provisions 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long term periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to consolidation policy  trade receivables  inventories and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
also see footnote to our consolidated financial statements of this form k  organization and significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that our management must select when there are acceptable alternatives

the use of  of cash for investing activities for related primarily to the acquisition of property and equipment 
financing activities for used  of cash 
the financing activities primarily relate to the debt restructuring that occurred in march we used million in cash for financing activities in primarily for repayment of debt 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with various other covenants and restrictions under the terms of the financing agreements  including restrictions as to additional financings  the payment of dividends and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the company did not meet one of its covenants at december  effective december   the company s lenders have reset certain covenants for periods through march  to accommodate compliance 
based on these reset covenants  management believes that the company will be able to comply 
after adjusting the covenants  the company is in compliance with all covenants as of december  under our financing arrangements  substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral 
in march  ge equity and a group of our officers and directors purchased from pnc bank the pnc note due from thermoview in the original principal amount of million representing our credit facility 
pnc bank in january had declared the credit facility in default for covenant violations 
in connection with the purchase of the pnc note by ge equity and others  all defaults were waived 
if we default in the future under our debt arrangements  the lenders can  among other items  accelerate all amounts owed and increase interest rates on our debt 
an event of default could result in the loss of our subsidiaries because of the pledge of our ownership in all of our subsidiaries to the lenders 
as of december   we are not in default under any of our debt arrangements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations will allow us to meet our anticipated needs during at least the next months for debt service requirements  working capital requirements  planned property and equipment capital expenditures  expanding our retail segment  offering new technologically improved products to our customers  and integrating more thoroughly the advertising and marketing programs of our regional subsidiaries into a national home remodeling business 
in connection with adjusting certain covenants in loan agreements  the preferred shareholders agreed to modify terms of their agreements such that except under limited circumstances  cash dividend payments will not be required until july  we also believe in the longer term that cash will be sufficient to meet our needs 
however  we do not expect to continue our acquisition program soon 
in october  we opened a new retail sales office in phoenix  arizona  and are working to open two new retail offices in the upper midwest and in a southeastern state in also  we have and are investing in the development of alter lite light control windows and a new line of climate resistant  highly durable compozit windows 
in addition  we intend to more thoroughly integrate the advertising and marketing programs of our regional subsidiaries into a national home remodeling business over the next two years 
these various initiatives we expect will require cash from  to  in the next twelve months 
on or before our debt matures in march  we anticipate either extending the term of our current financing or refinancing it 
management retired million of debt through december  we do not expect annual capital expenditures for the next three years to significantly vary from amounts reported for the last three years  which have been in the range of  to  annually 
pending litigation thermoview does not anticipate any significant adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows because of the pending litigation described in item  legal proceedings  except for the following 
although thermoview intends to vigorously defend the clemmens suit  an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
inflation due to relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december    and inflation did not cause a significant increase in our costs 
seasonality historically  our results of operations have fluctuated on a seasonal basis 
we have experienced lower levels of sales and profitability during the period from mid november to mid march  impacting the first and fourth quarters of each year 
inclement weather conditions in the winter and spring months in our markets located in the north central united states  which limit our ability to install exterior home improvement products  reduces demand for windows  doors  vinyl siding and related products 
our intention is to expand our southern california markets and to enter other markets in the southern united states to reduce the impact of seasonality  if we have the available capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in march  we restructured our debt and  as a result  all of our debt is fixed rate debt 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of our fixed rate debt due to the differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to our fixed rate debt currently outstanding  a change in interest rates for example  from to would not have resulted in a significant change in the fair value of our fixed rate debt
