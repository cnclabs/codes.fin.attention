item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
as a result of the march financing and  in addition  if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  your percentage ownership in the company will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be forced to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs and we may have to curtail one or more commercial activities 
we may be delisted from nasdaq resulting in a limited public or private market for our common stock and volatility in our stock price 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq national market 
on january   we received a notice from nasdaq stating that we were not in compliance with their continued listing requirements because our common stock bid price had fallen below nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement for consecutive trading days 
on february   orchid attended a hearing before the nasdaq qualifications panel the panel to appeal the staff s determination 
on march   the panel determined to continue listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market through june  if we are unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement by june   and any appeal to nasdaq for relief from this requirement is unsuccessful  our common stock will be delisted from trading on the nasdaq national market 
if this were to happen  trading in our common stock would decrease substantially  or may cease altogether  the market price of the common stock may decline further  potentially to zero  and stockholders may lose some or all of their investment 
furthermore  delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market would inhibit  if not preclude  our ability to raise additional working capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
if our common stock is delisted from nasdaq  the founders of geneshield may terminate their agreements with geneshield 
pursuant to the terms of our may contribution and license agreement with the founders of geneshield  if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq national market for a period of days  subject to certain cure periods  the founders may terminate the contribution and license agreement which would preclude geneshield from operating as currently structured  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are at an early stage of development and may never become profitable 
we organized our company as a delaware corporation on march  and have a short operating history 
the market for the products and services that we develop  manufacture and market  all of which are derived from genomics and microfluidics technologies  is uncertain 
we face risks related to our ability to develop  market and maintain competitive technologies  products and services  anticipate and adapt to changes in our rapidly evolving markets  retain current collaborators and customers and attract new collaborators and customers for our genoprofiling products and services in paternity  forensics  disease susceptibility  diagnostic and pharmacogenetic testing  attract  retain and motivate qualified management  technical and scientific personnel  obtain additional capital to support the expenses of developing our technologies and commercializing our products and services  and transition successfully from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities 

back to index if we fail to adequately manage these risks  we may never become profitable and our financial condition would suffer 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  and expect to continue to incur operating losses through at least the third quarter of or possibly beyond 
we have had substantial operating losses since our inception  and we expect our operating losses to continue at least through the third quarter of and possibly beyond 
for example  we experienced net losses of million for the year ended december   million in  and million in in order to further develop and commercialize our paternity  forensic and animal testing services  as well as our pharmacogenomic services provided by geneshield  we will need to incur expenses in connection with our internal development and commercialization programs 
as a result  we expect to incur operating losses at least through the third quarter of fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results may negatively impact our stock price 
revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant fluctuations are likely to continue in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders for our products and services  changes in the mix of our products and services offered  the number  timing and significance of new products and services introduced by our competitors  our ability to develop  market and introduce new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  changes in the cost  quality and availability of intellectual property and components required to manufacture or use our products and services  availability of commercial and government funding to researchers who use our products and services  and the timing of federal funding for forensics dna testing for backlog reductions through the national institue of justice 
development costs associated with our technologies  products and services  as well as personnel costs  marketing programs and overhead account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
we cannot adjust these expenses quickly in the short term 
in addition  if we successfully complete the sale of our diagnostics business  our revenues may decline 
if our revenues decline and we are not able to reduce our operating expenses accordingly  our loss of revenues and failure to reduce operating expenses could harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
in addition  market and other conditions may require certain non cash charges such as stock based compensation charges and impairment charges related to long lived assets to be recorded by us in future periods 
if our operating results in some quarters fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock is likely to fall 
we have limited manufacturing experience as it relates to manufacturing our products and delivering our services on a commercial scale 
we have limited process manufacturing experience and currently possess seven accredited facilities capable of producing limited quantities of our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use 
we have completed a significant portion of building out our manufacturing and service facilities to meet current market needs 
if commercial sales were to increase dramatically in the short term  we may need to scale up our manufacturing and service facilities 
if we are unable to successfully scale up our existing capabilities quickly to meet such a demand  we may not be able to provide our customers with the quantity of products and services they require  which would result in reduced revenues 
if any natural disaster were to significantly damage our manufacturing and service facilities or if other events were to cause our operations to fail  these events could prevent us from developing and producing our products and services 
furthermore  we may not have adequate insurance to cover the damage  which would adversely affect our results of operations 

back to index we have limited sales and marketing experience  and as a result  may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors in commercializing our potential products and services 
we have limited experience in sales and marketing 
we have only a small direct sales force and will continue to rely principally upon a small number of employees 
we intend to market our products and services through collaborations and distribution agreements with healthcare  pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and agricultural companies 
we also intend to continue to market our paternity  forensic and agricultural testing services to governmental entities and our paternity and pharmacogenomic testing services to individual consumers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully establish or maintain either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business strategy 
our development of future technologies and commercial products and services utilizing proprietary methods of single base primer extension may not be commercially viable or successful  which would adversely affect our revenues 
we cannot be certain that our prospective customers will value our products or services utilizing primer extension methodologies 
we are currently developing and commercializing only a limited number of products and services based on our snp scoring technologies 
we cannot assure you that we or our customers will be able to use our technologies to successfully identify and score snps 
in addition  any snps which we or our customers score may not be useful in assisting pharmaceutical or diagnostic product development 
our snp scoring technologies are in part directed toward the role of genes and polymorphisms in complex diseases 
a limited number of companies have developed or commercialized products based on gene discoveries and or polymorphisms to date 
accordingly  even if we or our customers are successful in scoring snps and associating these snps with specific drug responses or diseases  we cannot assure you that these discoveries will lead to the development of therapeutic or diagnostic products 
if we fail to successfully develop our snp scoring technologies or any commercially successful diagnostic products and services based on such technologies  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 
our snp scoring technologies involve novel uses of products  software and technologies that require validation in commercial applications 
previously unrecognized defects or limitations of our snp scoring technologies may become apparent in these commercial applications 
as a result  we may be unable to validate or achieve the improvements in the components of our snp scoring technologies necessary for their successful commercialization 
if we fail to maintain the identity genomics contracts we have with various state and governmental agencies or fail to enter into additional contracts  we would lose a significant source of revenues 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from the identity genomics services we provide in the paternity  forensic and agricultural fields 
these services are heavily dependent upon contracts we have with various governmental agencies  which are typically open to bid and awarded every one to three years 
the process and criteria for these awards are typically complex and highly competitive 
we may not be able to maintain any of our existing governmental contracts or be the successful bidder on any additional governmental contracts which may become available in the future  or negotiate terms acceptable to us in connection with any governmental contract awarded to us  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to improve our genetic analyses process  we could fail to achieve cost improvements and lose our competitive position in the market 
due to rapid product development and technological advancement in the medical diagnostics and dna testing industry  our growth and future operating results will depend  in significant part  upon our ability to apply new technologies to automate and improve our genetic analysis services and modify our existing products to take advantage of new technologies 
there can be no assurance that our development efforts will result in any additional commercially viable or successful improvements to our testing processes or products 
any potential improvements to the testing process or new products will require substantial additional investment  laboratory development and clinical testing  and possibly regulatory approvals  prior to commercialization 
our inability to successfully develop improvements to our testing processes or new products or to achieve market acceptance of such improvements or new products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the rapid product development and technological advancement in the genetic analysis and dna testing industry could result in our current or future dna testing services or products becoming obsolete 
we believe that our future operating results will depend substantially upon our ability to overcome 
back to index technological challenges  successfully introduce new technologies into our laboratories and to our customers and to gain access to and successfully integrate such technologies if developed by others 
if we cannot enter into new collaborations or licensing agreements  we may be unable to develop or commercialize our technologies  products and services 
our strategy for developing and commercializing technologies  products and services based on our discoveries depends upon our ability to form research collaborations and licensing arrangements 
as a result  we may be dependent on our collaborators and licensees for regulatory approval and manufacturing and marketing of diagnostic products and personalized medicine resulting from the application of our technologies 
if we are unable to enter into such research collaborations and licensing arrangements or implement our strategy to develop and commercialize diagnostic products based upon our discoveries it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
the early termination of any of our collaborations or licenses could harm our business and financial condition 
the collaboration agreements we have with third parties may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including the event of a material breach by us 
in addition  we intend to enter into additional collaborations and licenses with third parties  who may require that their agreements with us permit termination by them prior to the expiration of the negotiated term under certain circumstances 
if any third party were to terminate its agreement with us or otherwise fail to perform its obligations or to complete them in a timely manner  we could lose significant revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain consultants and scientific advisors 
we have historically maintained relationships with consultants and scientific advisors at academic and other institutions who have conducted research on our behalf critical to the development of our technologies  products and services 
the majority of these individuals have commitments to other entities and have limited time available for us 
some of these entities may also compete with us 
we will need to establish new relationships with consultants and scientific advisors in our genetic diversity fields 
we will have little  if any  control over the activities of any new collaborators and can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
further  we may not be able to negotiate acceptable collaborations in the future with additional consultants or scientific advisors at academic and other institutions 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our technologies  products and services  we may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors or to generate significant revenues 
we are subject to significant competition from companies that are pursuing products and services that are substantially similar to our existing and proposed products and services 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources than we do 
we may also compete against certain of our customers  which could adversely affect our relationships with them 
we also face significant competition in our strategy designed to identify and patent medically important uses of snps our geneshield strategies 
some of the organizations competing with us have greater financial and technical resources 
we also have limited experience working in the managed care and health care delivery industries and may not be able to successfully commercialize our inventions  either on our own or in partnership with others 
it may also take longer than currently anticipated for snps and pharmacogenetics to become widely used in clinical practice  which could adversely impact our ability to realize significant revenues from our geneshield business in the foreseeable future 
we believe our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to maintain a competitive position in the identity genomics field and the pharmacogenetics product field 
others may make rapid technological developments which may result in our technologies  products or services becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them 
our inability to also make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary methods and technologies  we may not be able to commercialize our products and services 
if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries  which would harm our competitive position 

back to index our commercial success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patent protection on many aspects of our business  technologies  products and services  including the discovery and the association of particular snps with disease predisposition and adverse drug metabolism  and on the products  methods and services we develop 
we may not be able to obtain new patents for these products  methods or services 
we will pursue patent protection on novel uses of snps discovered by us of known genes  as well as novel uses for previously identified snps discovered by third parties 
we may need to obtain a license from such third parties with respect to any patent covering such snps in order to make  use or sell any related products or services 
in addition  we may need to obtain a separate license from the gene patent holder 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
certain parties are attempting to rapidly identify and characterize genes and snps through the use of gene expression analysis and other technologies 
to the extent any patents issue to other parties on such partial or full length genes or snps or on uses for such genes or snps  the risk that the sale of products or processes developed by us or our collaborators may give rise to claims of patent infringement against us may increase 
others may have filed and  in the future  are likely to file  patent applications covering snp uses 
any such patent application could have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to previously issued patents covering snp uses 
we cannot assure you that any license that we may require under any such patents will be made available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
the scope of our issued patents may not provide us with adequate protection of our intellectual property  which would harm our competitive position 
any issued patents that cover our proprietary technologies may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial to us 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability 
the us patent and trademark office may invalidate one or more of our patents 
in addition  third parties may have patents of their own which could  if asserted  prevent us from practicing our proprietary technologies  including the methods we use to conduct snp scoring 
if we are otherwise unable to practice our patented technologies  we may not be able to commercialize our technologies  products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing  or may initiate litigation to determine that we are not infringing  on the intellectual property rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which would result in reduced revenues 
we may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  which could result in the forfeiture of these rights 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may need to initiate patent litigation against third parties 
these lawsuits could be expensive  take significant time  and could divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these lawsuits could result in the invalidation or a limitation in the scope of our patents or forfeiture of the rights associated with our patents 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any future litigation or that a court will not find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits 
during the course of these suits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which would likely cause the market price of our stock to decline 
other rights and measures that we rely upon to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to protect our products and services and could reduce our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
while we require employees  collaborators  consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur 
back to index the agreements may be breached  we may have inadequate remedies for any breach  proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors  or others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies 
if for any of the above reasons our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated  it would harm both our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position 
future acquisitions or mergers could disrupt our ongoing operations  increase our expenses and adversely affect our revenues 
since september  we acquired molecular tool  a developer of snp technologies  as well as genescreen  cellmark and lifecodes  providers of identity genomic and diagnostic testing services 
although we have no commitments or agreements with respect to any additional acquisitions or mergers at present  we anticipate that a portion of our future growth may be accomplished either by acquiring or merger with existing businesses 
factors that will affect the success of any potential acquisition or merger to be made by us include our ability to integrate acquired personnel  operations  products and technologies into our organization effectively  to motivate key personnel and to retain customers of acquired or merged businesses 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or merger opportunities  obtain any necessary financing for an acquisition on acceptable terms or successfully integrate acquired personnel and operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our revenues 
our failure to comply with applicable government and industry regulations may affect our ability to develop  produce  or market our potential products and services and may adversely affect our results of operations 
our development  manufacturing and service activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and patient samples 
we are subject to federal  state  local  uk and european laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products  as well as the conveyance  processing  and storage of data on patient samples 
further  we are subject to clia as a result of our acquisition of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes 
clia imposes certain certification requirements on all clinical laboratories performing tests on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis  prevention or testing of any diseases 
in addition  we are subject to the european directive ec as a result of our acquisition of the cellmark laboratory 
european directive ec imposes certain requirements in connection with cellmark s sale of gene diagnostic kits 
although we believe we comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by federal  state  local  uk and european laws and regulations  if we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations  including clia and european directive ec  or if an accident occurs  we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources 
all seven of our clinical quality genotyping laboratories must comply with various industry regulations and accreditation standards in order to continue to provide our paternity testing  forensic testing and bone marrow typing services 
for example  our genescreen laboratories have obtained accreditation from the american association of blood banks in order to provide paternity testing  from the national forensic science testing center in order to provide criminal forensic testing services and from the american society of histocompatibility and immunology in order to provide bone marrow donor typing services 
in addition  our cellmark laboratory must comply with various industry regulations and accreditation standards in order to provide paternity and forensic testing services 
for example  our cellmark laboratory has obtained accreditation from a notified body sgc yarsley ics and the united kingdom accreditation service and a registration from the ministry of agriculture  fisheries and food in order to provide paternity and forensic testing services 
in addition  cellmark must comply with regulations applicable to the marketing of its products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our accreditations with any of these authorities or comply with the regulations applicable to the marketing of cellmark products 
if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations promulgated by any of these agencies or if we were to lose our accreditation by any of them  the revenues supporting our genescreen or cellmark businesses could be eliminated or significantly reduced 

back to index the international sale of our products and services are subject to increased costs and other risks which could affect our revenues 
our cellmark laboratory as well as our diagnostic business unit rely upon international sales which are subject to certain inherent risks  including difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  and difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
we may be held liable for any inaccuracies associated with our research and identity genomics services  which may require us to defend ourselves in costly litigation 
our genoprofiling laboratory testing centers provide pharmacogenetic  forensic  paternity  diagnostic and animal testing services 
claims may be brought against us for false identification of paternity or other inaccuracies 
litigation of these claims can be costly 
we could expend significant funds during any litigation proceeding brought against us 
further  if a court were to require us to pay damages to a plaintiff  the amount of such damages could significantly harm our financial condition 
if our vendors fail to supply us with components for which availability is limited  we may experience delays in our product development and commercialization 
certain key components of our snp scoring and other pharmacogenetic and identity genomic testing technologies are currently available only from a single source or a limited number of sources 
we currently rely on outside vendors to supply or manufacture certain components of our systems and certain reagents we use in our services 
some or all of these key components may not continue to be available in commercial quantities at acceptable costs 
consequently  if any events cause delays or interruptions in the supply of our components  we may not be able to supply our customers with our products and services on a timely basis which would adversely affect our results of operations 
to the extent that our suppliers fail to meet our requirements completely or consistently  we may need to enter into new agreements with other suppliers  the terms of which may not be as favorable toward us as our existing supply agreements 
if we fail to hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenues 
our researchers  scientists and technicians have significant experience in research and development related to pharmacogenomics  identity genomics  and diagnostics 
if we were to lose these employees to our competitors  we could spend a significant amount of time and resources to replace them  which could impair our research and development efforts 
further  in order to maintain our manufacturing capability and to further our development efforts  we will need to hire  train and retain additional research  scientific and technical personnel 
if we are unable to do so  we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of our technologies  products and services 
in addition  we currently are operating without a chief executive officer 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to hire a chief executive officer that meets our requirements 
failure to hire a suitable chief executive officer may reduce investor interest and credibility in our company and negatively affect the share price 
risks related to the biotechnology industry public opinion regarding ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information may adversely affect demand for our products 
public opinion regarding ethical issues related to the confidentiality and appropriate use of genetic testing results and their application in personalized medicine may influence governmental authorities to call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing and its application in personalized medicine 
in addition  such authorities could prohibit testing for genetic predisposition for certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
any of these scenarios could reduce the potential markets for our products  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues 
commercializing medical products has associated risks  including compliance with clinical testing and manufacturing regulations 

back to index if we were to undertake the development of medical  testing or diagnostic products without the collaboration of others  we would have to expend significant funds 
any of our potential medical  testing or diagnostic products will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of diagnostic products based on new technologies 
these risks include the following possibilities that the products  if efficacious  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or uneconomical to market  that proprietary rights of third parties will preclude us or our collaborative partners from marketing such products  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
if we have difficulty managing these risks  we may not be able to develop commercially viable products 
in addition  clinical trials or marketing of any such potential medical  testing or diagnostic products may expose us to liability claims from the use of such products 
we may not be able to obtain product liability insurance and  even if we do  any coverage we obtain could be insufficient or costly 
in addition  should we choose to manufacture or to develop our own products independently  we will have to make significant investments in product development  marketing  sales and regulatory compliance resources  and we will have to establish or contract for the manufacture of products under the regulations of the fda regarding good manufacturing practices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop or commercialize successfully any potential medical  testing or diagnostic products 
risks associated with our common stock future issuance of our preferred stock may dilute the rights of our common stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  some of which the board of directors has already designated  and to determine the price  privileges and other terms of these shares 
our board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of our preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
we have various mechanisms in place that you as a stockholder may not consider favorable  which may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law and our adoption of a shareholder s rights plan  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be designated and issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  creating a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which will allow a majority of stockholders to control the election of all directors  requiring super majority voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  which requires all actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 

back to index pursuant to our stockholder rights plan  each share of our common stock has an associated preferred share purchase right 
the rights will not trade separately from the common stock until  and are exercisable only upon  the acquisition or the potential acquisition through tender offer by a person or group of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our stock incentive plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company 
our stock price has been  and likely will continue to be  volatile and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of companies quoted on the nasdaq stock market  including our market price  have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the nasdaq composite index has significantly declined since our initial public offering in may and remains very volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and likely will continue to be  subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements regarding the results of development efforts by us or our competitors  announcements regarding the acquisition of technologies or companies by us or our competitors  changes in our existing strategic alliances or licensing arrangements or formation of new alliances or arrangements  technological innovations or new commercial products developed by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio  developments or disputes concerning our proprietary rights  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports and or recommendations applicable to us  additions or departures of our key personnel  operating losses by us  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and degree of trading liquidity in our common stock  continued economic uncertainty with respect to valuation of certain technology companies and other market conditions  and our ability to maintain our common stock listing on the nasdaq national market 
we cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not fluctuate significantly 
one or more of these factors could significantly harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our common stock in the public market  which would adversely affect our business and financial operations 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders will have substantial control over our affairs 
our directors  executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders 
these matters include the election and removal of our directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  they may dictate the management of our business and affairs 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination of which you might otherwise approve 

back to index item properties we lease four facilities which provide us with approximately  square feet for our operations in princeton  new jersey which serve as our headquarters and as the base for marketing and product support operations 
we are currently in default for nonpayment of rent in connection with one of the leases for one of the four facilities encompassing approximately  square feet 
this facility is not essential to our continued operation 
we lease approximately  square feet of office space in roslyn  virginia 
we lease an approximately  square foot facility in dallas  texas  an approximately  square foot facility in dayton  ohio  and an approximately  square foot facility in sacramento  california 
we also lease an approximately  square foot facility in stamford  connecticut  an approximately  square foot facility in germantown  maryland  an approximately  square foot facility in nashville  tennessee  and an approximately  square foot facility in east lansing  michigan 
of these facilities  these last eight include clia approved laboratories where our genetic dna diversity testing services are located 
we also lease a total of approximately  square feet in three buildings located in abingdon  uk for the operations of orchid biosciences europe limited 
we currently believe our facilities are sufficient to meet our space requirements through the year we are currently attempting to sublease our princeton based facilities 
item legal proceedings on february  we received a notice of lawsuit and request for waiver of service of summons and a copy of the complaint filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in connection with a class action lawsuit 
the complaint purportedly was filed on behalf of persons purchasing our stock between may  and december   and alleged violations of sections  a and of the securities act of  as amended  and section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the complaint alleged that  in connection with our may  initial public offering  the defendants failed to disclose additional and excessive commissions purportedly solicited by and paid to the underwriter defendants in exchange for allocating shares of our stock to preferred customers and alleged agreements among the underwriter defendants and preferred customers tying the allocation of ipo shares to agreements to make additional aftermarket purchases at pre determined prices 
plaintiffs claim that the failure to disclose these alleged arrangements made our registration statement on form s filed with the sec in may and the prospectus  a part of the registration statement  materially false and misleading 
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages 
on february   we received notice of the court s decision to dismiss the section b claims against orchid 
the claims against individuals officers named as defendants were earlier dismissed without prejudice  subject to a tolling agreement 
there is currently a draft settlement agreement in review by defendant issuers 
we have not reserved any amount related to this case as we believe that the allegations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs claims 
we had been in a litigation with st 
louis university of st 
louis  missouri regarding its belief that our snp scoring technology infringes certain claims under us patent  which was controlled by the university 
on august   the parties dismissed the litigation 
st 
louis university conditionally assigned both the patent and all license agreements related thereto to us 
on march   st 
louis university notified us that it was unable to obtain a required consent to assign the patent to us 
pursuant to the terms of our settlement agreement with st 
louis university  the failure to obtain such consent results in the automatic grant to us of an exclusive license under the patent 
we are currently in discussions with st 
louis university regarding the terms of such license and the restructuring of our obligations to st 
louis university 
we are a co defendant in litigation commenced by enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc against ten defendants 
the complaint asserts that we purchased materials from plaintiffs authorized distributor and resold those materials in a manner not authorized by the related distribution agreements 
the complaint  therefore  seeks money damages based primarily on alleged patent infringement by us 
we have asserted a cross claim for indemnification against the distributor 
the litigation currently is in fact discovery and no expert discovery has occurred 
as a result  it is not possible for us to provide an opinion on the likely outcome of the various claims  but we intend to vigorously defend against plaintiffs claims as we believe the claims against us are without merit 
prior to our acquisition of lifecodes  which occurred on december   lifecodes sold medical molecular diagnostics gmbh  or mmd  a wholly owned subsidiary of lifecodes based in dresden  germany to duetsche knochenmarkspenderdatei gemeinnutzige gesellschaft mbh  or dkms  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated november  spa 
upon the acquisition of lifecodes  we assumed lifecodes obligations to dkms under the spa 
the mmd lab conducts hla typing services using both membrane and microarray technologies 
lifecodes has clinically validated and used the microarray technology in its hla testing laboratory in the us 
the equipment in this laboratory has produced reliable results for lifecodes and the management of lifecodes had no reason to believe that the 
back to index identical equipment  which is installed in the mmd lab  would operate any differently 
we met our obligation to provide a laboratory director for the first year of the contract following the acquisition 
our laboratory director also successfully guided the mmd lab through stringent ashi mandated inspections to obtain ashi regulatory certification 
during the transition of ownership  dkms expressed concerns about the operating effectiveness of the equipment in the mmd lab 
in the opinion of lifecodes and our management  these concerns reflect a failure of dkms to commit appropriately trained personnel to the mmd lab  rather than equipment concerns 
as a result of this continuing dispute  we anticipate receiving notification in the near future that dkms has filed a suit against us for damages under the spa for the full amount of the cost to acquire mmd 
dkms is anticipated to claim defects in the mmd lab 
we have not reserved any amount related to this case and believe that the allegations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against these anticipated claims 
legal proceedings are likely to occur no earlier than the fall in addition  in december  we filed a claim in germany against dkms for significant unpaid accounts receivable that accrued during the year ended december  the accounts receivable amounts were for hla typing conducted by the orchid diagnostics business unit  which we currently plan to sell 
the services performed by the diagnostics business unit were exclusively upon dkms request 
legal proceedings for our outstanding accounts receivable are expected to take place in germany by summer item submission of matters to a vote of security holders no matters were submitted during the fourth quarter of the year ended december

overview we are engaged in the provision of services and products for profiling genetic uniqueness 
since we began operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the provision of dna testing and the development and application of a portfolio of products and services using our proprietary biochemistry for scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms  or snps  as well as microfluidics technologies for applications  principally in the field of high volume snp scoring and pharmacogenetics analysis 
in  our business focused on our snp scoring products and services that used our proprietary snp it primer extension technology  and on our identity genomics services in paternity and forensics 
during  we entered into various agreements 
these agreements had varying terms and included but were not limited to i services agreements whereby we agreed to provide genetic analysis services  ii services agreements under which we would provide snp genotyping services  iii license agreements pursuant to which we granted third parties royalty bearing  nonexclusive and exclusive licenses to use our snp it single base primer extension technology to produce and sell reagent kits and software incorporating our technology  and iv agreements under which we agreed to provide various orchid products under the proprietary labels such as snpstream instruments  snpware and elucigene consumables 
since late  following our acquisition of genescreen  inc genescreen and  our subsequent acquisitions of cellmark and lifecodes  both in  we have been a leading provider of dna testing services in the paternity  forensics and human leukocyte antigen  or hla  transplantation typing fields 
during  we conducted a strategic review of our business and  as a result  we are focusing on our high growth services businesses where we are a market leader in profiling genetic uniqueness  including forensics  paternity and public health testing as well as personalized medicine 
in december  we disposed of our snp genotyping instruments and related consumables assets offered by our orchid life sciences business unit 
we intend to continue to leverage our leading snp technology in providing genoprofiling services offered by our other business units 
during we also decided to sell our diagnostics business unit 
this business unit offers diagnostic testing consumables for laboratories throughout the us and europe as well as hla testing for organ transplantation and cystic fibrosis testing instrumentation 
the diagnostic business unit is considered to be a non core asset that we expect to sell and  therefore  has been reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated results of operations 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend largely on our ability to continue to grow revenues and increase gross margins in genoprofiling services for the forensics  paternity  agricultural  and personalized healthcare markets 
our provision of genoprofiling services depends  in part  on our ability to leverage our leading snp technology where it provides us a competitive advantage 
we have incurred losses since inception  and  as of december   we had total stockholders equity of approximately million  including an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses at least through the third quarter of we expect the need to raise additional cash to fund operations until we become profitable which is anticipated to be in late during  we secured a million line of credit with a commercial lender which expires in december but contains automatic renewal provisions at the commercial lender s option 
in  we issued and sold  units consisting of one share of our series a convertible preferred stock and one warrant to purchase our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million see liquidity and capital resources below 
in addition  we are also evaluating other sources of cash including our commitment to sell and divest non core assets such as the diagnostics business unit 
we cannot make any assurance that any of these prospective arrangements to secure cash to fund future operations will be successful 
acquisition  divestitures and establishment of new businesses on december   we acquired genescreen  inc  which operates dna testing laboratories in dallas  texas and dayton  ohio 
orchid genescreen performs dna laboratory analyses for paternity  transplantation  and forensic testing 
orchid genescreen s primary source of revenue is paternity testing under contracts with various state and county government agencies 
on february   we acquired cellmark diagnostics  a division of astrazeneca  in an asset acquisition 
cellmark is a leading provider of genetic testing services in the uk and sells kits and conducts testing for genetic diseases  including cystic fibrosis 

back to index on december   we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of lifecodes corporation 
lifecodes is a leading provider of dna testing for forensics and paternity in the us 
we acquired lifecodes in order to strengthen our position in the clinical grade testing market 
lifecodes also maintains a diagnostic kit business which  subsequent to our sale of the orchid life sciences product related assets  comprises our only products business and which is currently held for sale as part of orchid diagnostics 
we view this acquisition  in addition to the two previous acquisitions of genescreen and cellmark  as a significant step in providing cost efficient  high throughput clinical testing businesses which form the core focus of our company 
the genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes businesses in paternity and forensics testing support our goal of extending our genoprofiling business 
we intend to apply our snp technology to the paternity and forensics businesses of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes where it enables us to reduce the cost of providing genotyping services 
we also plan to use our laboratories to conduct pharmacogenetic snp scoring services that we plan to offer to subscribers in the future through a number of distribution channels 
our dna testing business is dependent upon our ability to successfully and competitively bid and qualify for contracts with various governmental entities to provide paternity and forensics testing services 
we expect revenues from our respective forensics businesses of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes to increase as dna analyses are increasingly being used by the authorities within the criminal justice system to identify perpetrators and exonerate the innocent 
our geneshield business  established in  is developing a number of innovative pharmacogenetic based programs designed to accelerate the adoption of personalized medicine 
these programs are focused on health outcomes  specifically how a person s individual genetic makeup can affect responses to many prescription and over the counter medicines 
orchid geneshield expects to launch the commercialization of one of its programs  rxshield  in in december  as part of our strategic restructuring  we sold the products related assets of the orchid life sciences business to beckman coulter  inc for a combination of cash payments and beckman coulter s assumption of certain debt 
in addition  we have committed to sell the orchid diagnostics business unit 
we believe that our acquisitions  establishment of new businesses and selected divestitures will allow us to focus on key portions of our business and allow us to move closer to achieving profitability 
compensation charges in prior years  we recorded deferred compensation resulting from the granting of stock options to employees  directors  or consultants with exercise prices below the fair market value of the underlying common stock at the date of their grant 
during and  all stock options were granted with grant prices equal to the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
the portion of these deferred compensation amounts which resulted from grants to consultants is subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period based upon the changes in the fair value of our common stock until the consultant completes performance under his or her respective option agreement 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition we have several sources of revenues 
prior to our acquisitions of genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes  we derived substantially all of our revenues from research and development collaborations  technology grants and awards from several governmental agencies 
in  we derived our first revenues from the placement of our first commercial snpstream hardware system  and through  we derived revenues from the sale of snp it based consumables 
as a result of the sale of assets to beckman coulter  we will no longer have revenues from placements of snpstream systems or snpware based consumables in the future 
we also derived license revenues beginning in in  we derived our first revenues from the performance of laboratory dna testing services by genescreen  our wholly owned subsidiary  in the us 
in  we derived our first revenues from the sale of testing kits and laboratory dna testing services from our cellmark division in the uk 
in connection with the research and development collaborations that provided the majority of our revenues in the early years of our corporate history  we recognized revenues when related research expenses are incurred and when we satisfied specific performance obligations under the terms of the respective research contracts 
we deferred up front licensing fees obtained in connection with such agreements and amortized them over the estimated performance period of the respective research contract 
we recognized milestone 
back to index payments as revenues upon the completion of the milestone event or requirement  if it represented the achievement of a significant step in research and development or performance process 
we recognized dna laboratory and snp scoring services revenues on a completed contract basis at the time test results were completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
we offered our snpstream system hardware in two basic types of transactions  either a purchase and sale transaction or an arrangement in which the customer takes possession of the system and pays an access fee for its use 
we recorded revenues on the sale of the hardware upon transfer of title and after we had met all of our significant performance obligations 
we deferred access fee payments that we received when a system was initially placed with a customer  and recognized revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
revenues from the sale of consumables were recognized upon the transfer of title  generally when our products were shipped to our customers from our facilities 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  were recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we had no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we had significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees were deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in market value of assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets  excluding goodwill  amounted to million as of december  goodwill is subject to at least an annual recoverability assessment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission on fasb statements   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
under certain provisions of sfas  gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt should no longer be segregated on the income statement as extraordinary items net of the effects of income taxes 
instead  those gains and losses should be included as a component of income before income taxes 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  with early adoption encouraged 
any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt that was 
back to index classified as an extraordinary item should be reclassified upon adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when a company commits to such an activity and also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
we will adopt sfas for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the nasdaq national marketing listing we received a notice from the nasdaq national stock market indicating that we have failed to comply with the minimum bid price required for continued listing by marketplace rule a and that our common stock is subject to delisting from the nasdaq 
we filed a request for a hearing before the nasdaq qualifications panel the panel to appeal the staff determination  which occurred on february  on march   the panel determined to continue listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market through june  we have implemented a number of actions during the past several months which are designed to enhance our overall business  reduce our operating losses and strengthen our cash position 
we expect that these actions  as well as further initiatives currently being pursued  will help increase our share price above before june  we are also seeking stockholder approval to implement a reverse stock split in order to comply with the minimum bid price requirement 
we have filed a definitive proxy statement regarding the reverse stock split proposal with the securities and exchange commission sec  and have mailed the definitive proxy statement regarding this proposal to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that the panel will decide to allow us to remain listed or that our actions will prevent the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market after june  results of operations years ended december  and the diagnostic business unit is considered to be a non core asset which we expect to and have committed to sell and  therefore  has been reflected as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  we have not included the results of operations of the diagnostics business held for sale in the results of continuing operations in any period presented 
the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of the diagnostics business held for sale have been reflected as such in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and as we expect to sell this business within the next year  all of the assets and liabilities as of december  have been reflected as current 
revenues revenues for the year ended december  of approximately million represents an increase of approximately million as compared to revenues of approximately million for this increase is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in clinical laboratory testing revenues  which primarily relates to an increase in clinical laboratory testing revenues from our acquisition of lifecodes  which we acquired in december lifecodes had clinical laboratory testing revenues during the year ended december  of approximately million as compared to clinical laboratory testing revenues of million in our business based in the uk experienced an increase in clinical laboratory testing revenues in as well 
our uk business  which performs paternity and forensics testing as well as public health snp genotyping services  had clinical laboratory testing revenues of approximately during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  product revenues and access fees which decreased by approximately million from million during the year ended december  to approximately million during the year ended december  relate primarily to snp instrumentation and consumables 
the decrease in revenues on a year over year basis relates to a disappointing product launch of our ultra high throughput uht product platform  which was ultimately sold during the fourth quarter of due to our divestiture of the orchid life sciences products related assets in december  we will not have additional revenues from the placement of snpstream systems or the sale of snpware consumables 
we also recognized approximately million in license  grant and other revenues during the year ended december   compared to million 
back to index during the year ended december  this decline relates to various technology licensing arrangements entered into in which did not occur in as a result of the strategic refocusing of our business  we anticipate entering into fewer licensing arrangements than in prior years as we focus on the services businesses 
cost of product revenues and access fees cost of product revenues and access fees for the year ended december  was approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees  compared to approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees  for during  the cost of product revenues and access fees includes an inventory charge of approximately million which relates to the costs of discontinued inventory 
as adjusted  without the effect of this inventory charge  the cost of product revenues and access fees would have been approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees 
this percentage decrease in cost of product revenues and access fees as a percentage of product revenues and access fees  excluding the effect of the inventory charge  is attributable to an increase in the proportion of snpware consumables which had a higher gross margin than snpstream systems  for the year ended december  we divested our commercialization efforts relating to the snpstream systems and snpware consumables in december with our sale of the orchid life sciences products related assets to beckman coulter 
cost of clinical laboratory testing cost of clinical laboratory testing was approximately million  or of clinical laboratory testing revenues  for the year ended december  compared to approximately million  or of clinical laboratory testing revenues  in the increase in cost of clinical laboratory testing revenues  in dollars  was primarily attributable to increased costs of approximately million associated with a full year of cost related to lifecodes 
the decrease in cost of clinical laboratory testing revenues as a percent of clinical laboratory testing revenues is attributed to the inclusion of lifecodes in the results of operations for a full twelve month period  which generates a higher gross margin on clinical laboratory testing revenues than our previous clinical laboratory testing business 
in addition  our uk based business has experienced significant growth in higher margin clinical laboratory testing that also contributed to the improved cost of clinical laboratory testing on a percentage basis 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of software development costs associated with our geneshield business unit and million of research and development costs associated with an internal decision to utilize inventory previously held for sale in the research and development of our ultra high throughput genotyping product for use in our business units other than orchid life sciences 
without giving effect to these research and development charges  the decrease in research and development expenses would have been approximately million 
the decrease in research and development expense for the year ended december  as compared to the comparable previous year was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchases of laboratory supplies of approximately million 
there was also a reduction in research and development personnel  primarily related to our life sciences business unit  and facility costs which contributed to the overall decrease during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
during the year ended december   we had a significant amount of research and development costs in connection with the expansion of our internal and collaborative efforts  including our collaboration with the snp consortium which was not incurred during the year ended december   except for an insignificant amount during early during  we also had a reduction in salary expense from the restructuring efforts taken during the year ended december  marketing and sales expenses marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
these costs include travel  advertising  market research costs  and certain professional fees 
marketing and sales expense for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the comparable year of the increase in these costs of approximately million was substantially related to lifecodes costs of million during the current year which were not included in the previous year s results of operations 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  general legal and intellectual property and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative 
back to index expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for we attribute the increase in overall general and administrative expenses to lifecodes which accounted for approximately million in general and administrative expenses which were not included in the previous year s results of operations 
in addition  our uk business had general and administrative expenses of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during which was caused by the growth of that business and the inclusion of its results of operations for a full month period 
impairment of assets we recorded approximately million in impairment of asset charges during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during as a result of continuing losses incurred by our life sciences business unit  we prepared an internal evaluation of this unit s long lived assets 
based on this internal evaluation  approximately million of laboratory equipment was determined to be idle and not able to be utilized in our other facilities and  therefore  determined to be permanently impaired 
in addition  we estimated an impairment loss of approximately million as it relates to leasehold improvements related to a facility utilized by the life sciences business unit 
certain intangibles which underlie the primer extension technology were considered permanently impaired and were written down by approximately million during the year ended december  these intangible assets supported our life sciences business unit 
upon completion of a strategic review  a change in senior management and the sale of the life sciences product related assets in  we determined that these assets were no longer needed for our current operations 
in addition  certain investments were impaired by approximately million 
the impairment of assets of million recorded during the year ended december  relates to million of goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisition of genescreen in december of as well as an impairment of lab equipment of million which represents the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment exceeds the related fair value of the snpstream k instrumentation which was considered impaired with the anticipated introduction of the uht genotyping platform 
restructuring during the year ended december   we formalized and announced plans to restructure certain operations in order to reduce costs 
as a result  over positions which cover certain areas of our operations were eliminated 
most of these terminations were from our princeton  new jersey facilities 
during the year ended december   we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million which consisted of employee related charges such as severance  benefits and outplacement services of approximately million and approximately million of facility charges related to lease exit costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million as a restructuring charge related to severance benefits and the closure costs for a facility 
amortization of intangible assets during the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of amortization of intangible assets as compared to approximately million during during the prior year  a significant portion of the amortization of intangible assets related to goodwill recorded on previously acquired businesses which  effective january  are no longer amortized 
also  during the year ended december   we have recorded amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired pursuant to our acquisitions of lifecodes in december of and cellmark in february of  which were not amortized for the full year in interest income interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for this decrease was primarily due to interest received on larger cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balances which we held during this decrease is also attributable to lower interest rates during as compared to interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million in interest expense during these years was comparable because of the comparable level of long term debt 

back to index loss on sale of assets on december   we sold our life sciences product related assets to beckman coulter for cash of approximately million and the assumption of certain debt and liabilities 
our decision to sell this product line was the culmination of a strategic review untaken by management 
we sold inventory which consisted of our uht platform and certain equipment that was needed to operate and maintain our existing customer base 
we are also entitled to receive incremental consideration from the sale upon beckman coulter s completion of the next version of the ultra high throughput and ultimate sale of two uht systems that were placed by us prior to the consummation of the sale 
while beckman coulter also assumed our obligation under our supply arrangement with nen life sciences  we have committed to purchase million in materials and supplies from beckman coulter over the next two years 
we recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of approximately million during the year ended december  income tax benefit during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million 
this was related to the sale of some of our state net operating loss carryforwards to another company  which was authorized by the new jersey economic development authority 
the sales of net operating losses generated an income tax benefit of approximately million which was offset by approximately million of income tax expense which related to our uk based business  which was profitable during discontinued operations the diagnostic business unit is considered to be a non core asset which we expect to and have committed to sell and  therefore  has been reflected as a discontinued operation 
the results of operations for this business unit have been reflected in discontinued operations 
we recognized approximately and million in losses from the discontinuance of the diagnostic business during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss for the year ended december  is mainly a result of an approximate million impairment of long lived assets of the diagnostic business unit based on its estimated sale price  as well as approximately million in bad debt expense associated with a certain diagnostic customer 
net loss and net loss allocable to common stockholders due to the factors described above  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss and a net loss allocable to common stockholders of approximately million as compared to approximately million in years ended december  and revenues revenues for of approximately million represent an increase of approximately million as compared to revenues of approximately million for this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in clinical laboratory testing revenues  of which million related to our two acquisitions in  cellmark and lifecodes  an increase in revenues derived from our genescreen operations  as well as genotyping services performed under genotyping service arrangements entered into during product revenues and access fees also increased by approximately million during  of which million relates to our two acquisitions in  cellmark and lifecodes  the placement of snpstream systems  as well as an increase in related consumable sales 
we also recognized approximately million in collaboration revenues during which was primarily related to the successful completion of the first milestone under our genotyping agreement with astrazeneca  whereby we recognized million 
we also recognized license revenues of approximately million for versus million in  which was primarily composed of royalty bearing  nonexclusive  and exclusive licenses to use our snp it technology 
cost of product revenues and access fees cost of product revenues and access fees for was approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees  compared to approximately million  or of product revenues and access fees  for the increase in cost of product revenues and access fees as a percent of product revenues and access fees was attributable to an increased number of snpstream k placements in which had a lower gross margin 
the increase in cost of product revenues and access fees was attributable to the costs associated with the snpstream instrument placements  and to consumables sold during  including an increase of million related to our acquisition of cellmark on february  and lifecodes on december  
back to index cost of clinical laboratory testing cost of clinical laboratory testing was approximately million  or of clinical laboratory testing revenues for  compared to approximately million  or  for the increase was attributable to costs associated with our cellmark division of approximately million  which we acquired on february   and costs associated with lifecodes of approximately million  which we acquired on december  the decrease in cost of clinical laboratory testing as a percent of clinical laboratory testing revenues was attributed to our cellmark division  which generates a higher gross margin 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototypes and test units  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses for were approximately million  compared to approximately million for the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million for included the netting effect of a prior year transaction with sarnoff corporation whereby we recorded an approximate million charge related to approximately a million cash payment made to and the fair value of  shares of common stock and five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock issued to sarnoff corporation as an advance on the issuances that would have been owed in december under a license and option agreement  and an amendment to that agreement 
as the licensed technology under this agreement had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses  the million was charged to research and development 
excluding this transaction  research and development expense in increased by approximately million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased expenses as we hired additional research and development personnel of approximately million  increased purchases of material and laboratory supplies of approximately million  and increased research and development expenses related to our genescreen  cellmark  and lifecodes facilities of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
this increase was also attributable to increased facilities expenses in connection with the expansion of our internal and collaborative research efforts  including our collaboration with the snp consortium  of approximately million 
these various increases were offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation during of approximately million 
marketing and sales expenses marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for sales people within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
these costs include travel  advertising  market research costs  and certain professional fees 
marketing and sales expense for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the comparable year of the increase in these costs of approximately million was directly related to commercialization of our snp stream product line and related consumables 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution and protection  and other corporate expenses including business development and general legal activities 
general  and administrative expenses for were approximately million  an increase of approximately million  as compared to approximately million for we attributed this increase primarily to the expansion of administration facilities and the hiring of additional personnel as we increased our executive and administrative staffing in anticipation of growth 
during  there was an increase in our depreciation expense of approximately million  due to capital expenditures made in for computers  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements associated with facilities expansion 
we also incurred additional salaries and related expenses of approximately million  as well as an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately million relating to our cellmark division and million relating to lifecodes 
these various increases in general and administrative expenses were offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation in of approximately million 
impairment of assets during  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to write down goodwill which was recorded when we acquired genescreen on december  subsequent to september   we announced our intention to acquire lifecodes as 
back to index discussed above 
lifecodes operates primarily in the same industry and provides the same services as genescreen 
based primarily on the acquisition price for lifecodes  among other matters  we determined that a triggering event occurred for which an impairment review would be required pursuant to sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the impairment charge was recorded based on the fair value of genescreen as computed using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
this charge reduced the unamortized goodwill recorded in the acquisition of genescreen to zero 
this charge related to the orchid identity genomics segment of our business based on the segment reporting 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge related to certain equipment 
we utilize this equipment primarily to perform research and development activities and  to a limited extent  genotyping services for customers 
during  we launched the second generation of this equipment 
the second generation provides higher throughput and is more cost effective 
we expect to use this next generation equipment to replace the first generation equipment over time and to provide the same services and functions that the first generation equipment provided 
we performed an analysis of our future needs relating to this equipment and determined its fair value 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which represents the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment exceeded the related fair value 
interest income interest income for of approximately million decreased approximately million from approximately million for this decrease was primarily due to interest received on larger cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances which we held during  which were reduced in by amounts used to fund operating activities 
this decrease was also attributable to lower interest rates during compared to interest expense interest expense for was approximately million compared to approximately million for this increase was due to borrowings made during late and in may and december on our existing equipment loan line

as of december   the company had million outstanding under the line of credit 
in march  we completed a follow on offering of our common stock for approximately million 
at december   we had borrowings of approximately million outstanding related to a loan which was entered into primarily for equipment financing 
if we do not maintain minimum unrestricted cash  as defined in the loan agreement  equal to the greater of million or twelve months cash needs calculated by taking the trailing three months net cash used in operations multiplied by four  we are required to provide a cash security deposit or letter of credit equal to an amount defined in the loan agreement  not to exceed of outstanding amounts on draws made in or subsequent to december as of december   and just prior to our march equity offering we did not maintain the minimum unrestricted cash defined in the loan agreement 
we received a waiver from our lender regarding our noncompliance with this covenant for this period 
subsequent to march   we did not maintain the minimum cash defined in the loan agreement 
we have also received written notice from the lender stating that the lender waived the financial covenant violation as a result of not maintaining a pledge of cash security deposit or letter or credit under this loan agreement for the period of noncompliance through june  on june   we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of approximately million as required by the loan agreement  which was supported by a cash restriction on certain securities held by us 
as such  this cash restriction  in addition to cash restricted under two of our operating leases is reflected as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  of million  of which approximately million is classified as a long term asset 
on may   we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
subject to our ongoing obligations under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  the registration statement permits us to offer and sell various types of securities  up to an aggregate value of approximately million  of which approximately million remains available for future use

the subsequent sale of common stock in february and march for gross proceeds of approximately million was also registered under a prospectus supplement to this registration statement 
the availability to offer and sell various types of securities under the shelf registration statement expires in may to issue securities registered on this registration statement we must either have an aggregate market value of the voting and non voting common equity excluding shares held by our affiliates of million or more  or we must file a post effective amendment to the registration statement on form s or s as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to approximately million as of december  working capital decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  this is due to cash used to fund operations for the year ended 
back to index december   partially offset by our follow on offering of common stock in february and march which generated net proceeds of approximately million and proceeds of million from our line of credit which was entered into during december of net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was approximately million compared with approximately million for investing activities included capital expenditures of approximately million  and approximately million of proceeds from maturities  net of purchases  of short term investments 
financing activities primarily consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from our offering of common stock in february and march  million from our line of credit and repayment of debt of million 
we expect our restructuring efforts taken in will reduce future cash expenditures 
we believe that the result of these efforts coupled with anticipated divestitures of certain non core assets  expected increases in both revenues and gross margins in our remaining core business units and our financing in will enable us to operate our ongoing business activities until we reach operating profitability and positive cashflows  expected in late we believe that our existing cash on hand  in addition to the financing as described above  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to operate our ongoing business activities after that time if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
we may be unable to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following our ability to enter into strategic alliances or make acquisitions  our ability to divest non core assets  regulatory changes and competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the application of our snp technologies to our other business areas  including paternity  forensics  and pharmacogenetic testing  our ability to successfully secure contracts for high volume genotyping services from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and agricultural companies  the success rate of establishing new contracts  and renewal rate of existing contracts  for identity genomics services in the areas of paternity  forensics  and transplantation  the progress of our existing and future milestone and royalty producing activities  and the availability of additional funding at favorable terms  if necessary 
as of december   our net operating loss carry forwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized  our federal and state tax loss carry forwards will begin to expire in utilization of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the internal revenue code of we have not yet determined the extent to which limitations were triggered as a result of past financings or may be triggered as a result of future financings 
this annual limitation is likely to result in the expiration of certain net operating losses prior to their use
