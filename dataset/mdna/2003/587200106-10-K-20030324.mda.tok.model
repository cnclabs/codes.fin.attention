the company markets its products and services worldwide  primarily to large companies in the communications  computer  consumer electronics  semiconductor  aerospace  networking  multimedia and transportation industries 
the company sells and licenses its products through its direct sales force and an affiliated channel of distributors and sales representatives 
in addition to its corporate offices in wilsonville  oregon  the company has sales  support  software development and professional service offices worldwide 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company generally records product revenue from fixed term installment license agreements upon shipment and start of the license term 
in addition  support revenue is recognized over the license term and is allocated based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of support  as established by the price charged when such support is sold separately 
these installment license agreements are typically for three years 
the company uses these agreements as a standard business practice and has a history of successfully collecting under the original payment terms without making concessions on payments  products or services 
the agreements are with the company s top rated customers 
if the company no longer had a history of collecting without providing concessions on term agreements  then revenue would be required to be recognized as the payments become due over the license term 
this change would have a material impact on the company s results 
additionally  if customers fail to make the contractual payments under the installment license agreements  the company would have to recognize a bad debt charge 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required  which would result in an additional selling expense in the period such determination was made 
valuation of trade accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
the company regularly analyzes its customer accounts and when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors including length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customers  the current business environment and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be adjusted resulting in either additional selling expense or a reduction in selling expense in the period such determination was made 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase either income or contributed capital in the period such determination was made 
also  if the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to either expense or contributed capital in the period such determination was made 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is determined by comparing its carrying amount  including any associated intangible assets  to the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the asset relates 
if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets  then intangible assets are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets of the operation  to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending upon the nature of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator using a fair value approach 
in the event that  in the future  it is determined that the company s intangible assets have been impaired  an adjustment would be made that would result in a charge for the write down in the period that determination was made 
inventory the company purchases and commits to purchase inventory based upon forecasted shipments of its emulation hardware systems 
the company evaluates  on a quarterly basis  the need for inventory reserves based on projections of systems expected to ship within six months 
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established to account for the differences between forecasted shipments and the amount of purchased and committed inventory 
restructuring charges the company has recorded restructuring charges in connection with its plans to better align the cost structure with projected operations in the future 
these restructuring charges  which reflect management s commitment to a termination or exit plan that will be completed within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with severance benefits 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
the company has also recorded restructuring charges in connection with excess leased facilities to offset future rent  net of sublease income  of the abandoned office space and to write off leasehold improvements on abandoned office space 
the company worked with external real estate experts in each of the markets where properties are located to obtain assumptions used to determine the best estimate of the accrual 
however  if the real estate markets worsen and the company is not able to sublease the properties as expected  additional adjustments to the accrual may be required  which would result in an additional charge to earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if the real estate market strengthens and the company is able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  a benefit to special charges will be recognized 
recent acquisitions in february  the company acquired accelerated technology  inc ati  a provider of embedded software based in mobile  alabama 
the acquisition was an investment aimed at expanding the company s product offering and driving revenue growth which supported the premium paid over the fair market value of the individual assets

additionally  innoveda product revenues for the period from may to december  of  have been included in the company s revenues 
excluding the impact of ikos and innoveda revenues  the decrease in system and software revenues for was attributable to a decrease in both software product sales and emulation hardware system sales 
system and software sales declined as a result of the general downturn in the economy and more specifically due to ongoing financial difficulties experienced by customers in the telecommunications market 
for  the net decrease in system and software revenues was attributable to a decline in emulation hardware system sales  partially offset by increased software product sales 
emulation hardware system sales declined in due to the downturn in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries 
for  the increase in software product sales was primarily due to continued strength in the physical verification and analysis and deep submicron product lines 
for  this increase in software product revenue occurred despite weakening of the japanese yen versus the united states dollar which negatively impacted revenues 
see geographic revenues information for further discussion 
system and software gross margins were lower for compared to primarily due to a  write down of emulation system inventory in the second quarter to reduce the inventory to the amount that was expected to ship within six months on the assumption that any excess would be obsolete 
gross margin was also impacted by an increase in amortization of purchased technology to cost of revenues attributable to the acquisitions that occurred in system and software gross margins were higher for compared to due to greater mix of higher margin software product revenue versus lower margin emulation hardware system revenue and to a lesser extent lower product sales for which royalties were paid 
amortization of purchased technology costs to system and software cost of revenues was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of ati  ikos and innoveda during the increase in amortization in was primarily attributable to the recognition of a full year of amortization related to five acquisitions during purchased technology costs are amortized over three to five years to system and software cost of revenues

in  the company incurred merger and acquisition related charges of  for in process r d related to four of the five business combinations accounted for as purchases 
the company uses an independent third party valuation firm to determine the value of the in process r d acquired in its business acquisitions 
the value assigned to in process r d for the charges incurred in and related to research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the value was determined by estimating the net cash flows from the sale of products resulting from the completion of such projects and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows was based on the weighted average cost of capital 
other factors considered were the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability levels of the technology and the stage of completion of the technology 
the stage of completion of the products at the date of the acquisition were estimated based on r d costs that had been expended as of the date of acquisition as compared to total r d costs expected at completion 
the percentages derived from this calculation were then applied to the net present value of future cash flows to determine the in process charge 
the nature of the efforts to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 
the estimated net cash flows from these products were based on estimates of related revenues  cost of sales  r d costs  selling  general and administrative costs and income taxes 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that the company will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the risks associated with acquired r d are considered high and no assurance can be made that these products will generate any benefit or meet market expectations

the portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to the difference between financial and tax reporting of employee stock option exercises  for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to contributed capital  will be maintained until such benefits are actually realized on the company s income tax returns 
the remainder of the valuation allowance was based on the historical earnings patterns within individual taxing jurisdictions that make it uncertain that the company will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
effects of foreign currency fluctuations approximately half of the company s revenues are generated outside of the united states 
for  and  approximately one half to two thirds of european and all japanese revenues were subject to exchange rate fluctuations as they were booked in local currencies

factors that may affect future results and financial condition the statements contained under outlook for above and other statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation  statements containing the words believes  expects  projections and words of similar import  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
moreover  from time to time  the company may issue other forward looking statements 
forward looking statements regarding financial performance in future periods  including the statements above under outlook for  do not reflect potential impacts of mergers or acquisitions or other significant transactions or events that have not been announced as of the time the statements are made 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect future events or revised expectations 
the following discussion highlights factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the company s forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
weakness in the united states and international economies may materially adversely affect the company 
united states and international economies are experiencing an economic downturn which has had an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
continued weakness in these economies is likely to continue to adversely affect the timing and receipt of orders for the company s products and the company s results of operations 
revenue levels are dependent on the level of technology capital spending  which include expenditures for electronic design automation  or eda  software and other consulting services  in the united states and abroad 
a number of telecommunications companies have in the recent past filed for bankruptcy protection  and others have announced significant reductions and deferrals in capital spending 
a significant portion of the company s revenues has historically come from businesses operating in this sector 
in addition  demand for the company s products and services may be adversely affected by mergers and company restructurings in the electronics industry worldwide which could result in decreased or delayed capital spending patterns 
the company is subject to the cyclical nature of the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries  and the current downturn has  and any future downturns may  materially adversely affect the company 
purchases of the company s products and services are highly dependent upon new design projects initiated by integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies 
the integrated circuit industry is highly cyclical and is subject to constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence  price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the integrated circuit and electronics systems industries have experienced significant downturns  often connected with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both companies in these industries and their customers products and a decline in general economic conditions 
these downturns have caused diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
certain integrated circuit manufacturers and electronics systems companies announced a slowdown of demand and production in  which continued in during downturns such as the current one  the number of new design projects decreases 
the current slowdown has reduced  and any future downturns are likely to further reduce  the company s revenue and could materially adversely affect the company 
fluctuations in quarterly results of operations due to the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products could hurt the company s business and the market price of the company s common stock 
the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  varied quarterly operating results 
various factors affect the company s quarterly operating results and some of these are not within the company s control  including the timing of significant orders and the mix of licenses used to sell the company s products 
the company receives a material amount of its software product revenue from current quarter order performance  of which a substantial amount is usually booked in the last few weeks of each quarter 
a portion of the company s revenue often comes from multi million dollar contracts  the timing of the completion of and the terms of delivery of which can have a material impact on revenue recognition for a given quarter 
if the company fails to receive expected orders in a particular quarter  particularly large orders  the company s revenues for that quarter could be adversely affected and the company could fail to meet analysts expectations which could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the company uses fixed term installment sales agreements as a standard business practice 
these multi year  multi element term license agreements are typically three years in length and are used with larger customers that the company believes are credit worthy 
these agreements increase the risk associated with collectibility from customers that can arise for a variety of reasons including ability to pay  product dissatisfaction  disagreements and disputes 
if the company is unable to collect under any of these multi million dollar agreements  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents the company s revenue is also affected by the mix of licenses entered into in connection with the sale of software products 
the company s software licenses fall into three general categories perpetual  fixed term and subscription 
with perpetual and fixed term licenses  the company recognizes software product revenue at the beginning of the license period  while with subscription licenses the company recognizes software product revenue ratably over the license period 
accordingly  a shift in the license mix toward increased subscription licenses would result in increased deferral of software product revenue to future periods and would decrease current revenue  possibly resulting in the company not meeting revenue expectations 
the accounting rules governing software revenue recognition have been subject to authoritative interpretations that have generally made it more difficult to recognize software product revenue at the beginning of the license period 
these new and revised standards and interpretations could adversely affect the company s ability to meet revenue projections and affect the company s stock price 
the gross margin on the company s software products is greater than that for the company s hardware products  software support and professional services 
therefore  the company s gross margin may vary as a result of the mix of products and services sold 
additionally  the margin on software products varies year to year depending on the amount of third party royalties due to third parties for the mix of products sold 
the company also has a significant amount of fixed or relatively fixed costs  such as professional service employee costs and purchased technology amortization  and variable costs which are committed in advance and can only be adjusted periodically 
if anticipated revenue does not materialize as expected  the company s gross margins and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the lengthy sales cycle for the company s products and services and delay in customer consummation of projects makes the timing of the company s revenue difficult to predict 
the company has a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends between three and six months 
the complexity and expense associated with the company s products and services generally requires a lengthy customer evaluation and approval process 
consequently  the company may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent the company from pursuing other opportunities 
in addition  sales of the company s products and services may be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance review procedures  timing of budget cycles or timing of competitive evaluation processes 
intense competition in the eda industry could materially adversely affect the company 
competition in the eda industry is intense  which can lead to  among other things  price reductions  longer selling cycles  lower product margins  loss of market share and additional working capital requirements 
the company s success depends upon the company s ability to acquire or develop and market products and services that are innovative and cost competitive and that meet customer expectations 
the company currently competes primarily with two large companies cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc

as a result  from time to time  the company may be forced to respond to  or prosecute  intellectual property infringement claims to protect the company s rights or defend a customer s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  could consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation and cause product shipment delays  all of which could materially adversely affect the company 
in settling these claims  the company may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with the third parties claiming infringement 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if available  may not have terms acceptable to the company
