item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
all references to years are to our fiscal years  which end on june overview based on worldwide revenue  we are one of the largest photomask manufacturers in the world 
we sell our products to over customers and customer sites in more than different countries 
essentially all of our sales are to customers in the semiconductor manufacturing industry 
we manufacture a broad range of photomasks based on customer supplied design data 
we operate globally with established manufacturing facilities in north america  europe and asia 
we believe that over the long term  the market for photomasks in the semiconductor manufacturing process will increase due to the following trends proliferation of semiconductor applications  customization of semiconductor designs  increasing semiconductor device complexity  decreasing size of semiconductor designs  and shorter product lifecycles 
photomask manufacturing operations are capital intensive 
accordingly  at a given threshold of manufacturing capacity  a high proportion of our operating costs are fixed and remain relatively constant as sales volume increases or decreases 
to the extent that we have under utilized production capacity  operating profit increases or decreases significantly as sales volume increases or decreases 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated financial information expressed as a percentage of revenue  net for the periods indicated 
year ended june  revenue  net cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense special charges impairment of long lived assets operating profit loss income loss on warrants  net gain on sale of assets other income expense  net income loss before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for benefit from income taxes income loss before minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle minority interest in income of joint ventures income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue  net 
revenue  net is comprised primarily of photomask sales to semiconductor manufacturers 
revenue  net decreased percent from million in to million in from to  revenue  net produced in north america decreased from million to million  in europe increased from million to million and in asia decreased from million to million 
the decreases were attributable to a decline in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in unit demand 
revenue  net was also negatively impacted by work stoppages in europe and by a customer that required us to re certify one of our facilities in asia 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  depreciation and overhead 
cost of goods sold increased percent from million in to million in gross profit margin decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from a decline in revenue due to lower average selling prices  costs associated with the consolidation of trailing edge production in europe  the ramp up of our advanced production facility in dresden  germany and increased depreciation 
these increases in cost of goods sold were partially offset by benefits realized from our cost reduction programs 
we expect that gross profit margins will experience near term pressure primarily as a result of the start up costs for our dresden  germany manufacturing facility and consolidation costs in europe 
over the long term  we expect gross profit margins to improve as a result of lower costs resulting from our consolidation efforts in europe and impairment of long lived assets during see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries of sales and administrative personnel  marketing expense  general and administrative expense and product distribution expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased percent from million in to million in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased from percent in to percent in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily a result of the completion and implementation of new information systems  the ramp up of our dresden  germany facility and full year ownership of bindkey offset by lower costs associated with the divestiture of the photoblanks business and cost containment efforts 
we expect selling  general and administrative expense will increase in the near term as a result of increasing costs for the ramp up of our facility in dresden  germany and bindkey 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee costs  cost of consumed materials  depreciation  engineering related costs and our share of costs of the rtc and amtc joint ventures 
research and development expense decreased percent from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  research and development expense increased slightly from percent in to percent in the decrease in cost was attributable to reduced costs associated with the modification and extension of our agreement with the rtc partners offset partially by an increase in bindkey s eda software development expenses and start up expenses for the amtc 
we expect research and development expense will increase as we incur our share of the costs from the ramp up of the amtc in the fiscal special charges 
in  we recorded pre tax special charges totaling million related to cost reduction programs and acquired in process research development  or ipr d 
these initiatives were completed as of march  and the related liabilities were completely settled as of september  the special charges of million related to employee severance were the result of eliminating employment positions  primarily manufacturing  in north america and europe 
the special charges of million related to asset disposals and related costs resulted primarily from decommissioning trailing edge production equipment 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of bindkey in march  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d 
the amount attributed to ipr d was expensed at the date of acquisition as the projects had not reached technological feasibility nor had any alternative future use 
as a result of these actions  we realized a reduction in expenses of approximately million during in  we recorded special charges totaling million related to employee severance  asset disposals and related costs  and lease termination costs 
the special charges related to north america  europe and asia were million  million and million  respectively 
these special charges were the result of programs that were implemented to reduce costs 
the integration and consolidation initiatives in north america were completed as of march  and the related liabilities were substantially settled as of june  we plan to vacate the owned manufacturing facility in rousset  france and the leased manufacturing facility in hamburg  germany  complete the consolidation initiatives in europe and settle the related liabilities  including severance  by december  the integration and consolidation initiatives in asia were completed as of march  and the related liabilities were completely settled as of june  as a result of these actions  we expect to realize a reduction in expenses of approximately million during fiscal a summary of the related accrued liabilities is shown below in millions employee severance asset disposals and related costs lease termination and other costs total charges during utilized in remaining liability as of june  charges during utilized in remaining liability as of june  impairment of long lived assets 
during  we recorded a charge of million for reductions in the carrying value of certain long lived assets held and used in operations 
at fiscal year end and in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed a periodic review and evaluation of the carrying value of long lived assets and determined that  based on revised market assumptions reflecting the sustained industry downturn and the continued under utilization of production equipment  the carrying value of certain production facilities and equipment in north america and asia exceeded the current fair value 
asset impairment tests were performed at the facility site location level which is the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist 
the periodic review and evaluation of the carrying value of the long lived assets was performed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists 
the fair value of assets that were subject to impairment were determined using both the cost  market and income approaches 
as a result of our impairment of long lived assets  we also expect depreciation expense to be lower by approximately million to million per quarter subsequent to june  income loss on warrants  net 
during  we realized losses of million upon the exercise of all remaining warrants of a strategic partner and sale of the underlying securities 
we held no warrants during gain on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets represents the gain recognized upon a sale of property and equipment 
in march  we sold all of our photoblank manufacturing assets located in poughkeepsie  new york  to schott lithotec ag  or schott 
we also entered into a supply agreement with schott for a significant portion of our future purchases of photoblanks 
the total proceeds of million were allocated million to the assets sold and million to the supply agreement based on the projected cash flows that will be generated by the supply agreement  discounted to present value 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the supply agreement also allows us to be paid additional amounts totaling million during fiscal if specified purchase levels are achieved by march  other income expense  net 
other income expense  net includes interest expense  interest income and exchange gains and losses 
other income expense  net was million in and million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income reflective of lower interest rates and exchange losses from foreign currency movements 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for benefit from income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the federal statutory rate of percent to income loss before income taxes and minority interest as a result of our reduced tax rates in certain asian jurisdictions  our inability to record deferred tax benefits for net operating losses generated in certain tax jurisdictions and our need to place valuation allowances on certain other deferred tax assets as discussed below 
during  we recorded valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets in north america and the majority of those in europe primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards 
the restructuring in germany also resulted in a charge for a valuation allowance of million during the valuation allowances were recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of positive and negative evidence when determining the need for valuation allowances 
historical evidence  such as the operating results in north america and europe during the most recent three year period  is weighted more heavily in this assessment as compared to future expected results because of the uncertainty of actually achieving forecasted results 
our cumulative north america losses and europe losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence to require valuation allowances against our north america and europe net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient positive evidence exists to support their reversal 
during  we received income tax refunds of million by carrying north america net operating losses back to prior years 
also  our decision to carryback certain losses in france resulted in a tax benefit of million 
minority interest in income of joint ventures 
minority interest in income of joint ventures reflects our partners share of the earnings of our consolidated joint venture operations  which currently include our shanghai  china and hsinchu  taiwan operations 
the minority interest share of our income of joint ventures was million for and million for the decrease was a result of lower revenue and increased production costs 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  revenue  net 
revenue  net decreased percent from million in to million in demand for advanced photomasks  those with design technology of micron and below  grew from percent to percent of our revenue  during and  respectively 
total unit volume demand declined percent primarily as a result of our customers response to the significant downturn in the semiconductor industry during the year 
average selling prices decreased percent as a result of traditional product lifecycle declines in selling prices of certain technologies and customer initiated pressures and competitive pressures 
additionally our customers that maintain internal photomask operations reduced outsourcing during the year  reducing demand for higher priced leading edge products 
from to  revenue  net produced in north america decreased from million to million because of the decrease in average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in europe decreased from million to million because of the decrease in average selling price and unit volumes 
revenue  net produced in asia increased from million to million due primarily to an increase in average selling price and unit volumes 
increased unit volume in asia was a result of improved local demand combined with production transferred from north america and europe 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold decreased percent from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from decreased production volumes  benefits realized from our cost reduction programs and the overall efficiencies gained through the global reorganization of our manufacturing organization implemented in the quarter ended june  these reductions were partially offset by increased depreciation expense resulting from new investments in advanced production capabilities 
gross profit decreased from million during to million during as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from percent in to percent in primarily as a result of lower revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased percent from million during to million during this was primarily a result of the cost reduction programs implemented in the quarter ended june  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue  net increased from percent for to percent for as a result of lower revenue partially offset by the benefits realized from the cost reduction programs 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased percent from million during to million during the decrease was primarily as a result of synergies realized due to the reorganization of our technical group 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue  net increased from percent for to percent for the increase was due primarily to lower revenue 
special charges 
in  we recorded pre tax special charges totaling million related to cost reduction programs and acquired ipr d 
these initiatives were completed as of march  and the related liabilities were completely settled as of september  the special charges of million related to employee severance were the result of eliminating employment positions  primarily manufacturing  in north america and europe 
the special charges of million related to asset disposals and related costs resulted primarily from decommissioning trailing edge production equipment 
in connection with the acquisition of the assets of bindkey in march  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d 
the amount attributed to ipr d was expensed at the date of acquisition as the projects had not reached technological feasibility nor had any alternative future use 
income loss on warrants  net 
during  we realized losses of million upon the exercise of all remaining warrants of a strategic partner and sale of the underlying securities 
gain on sale of assets 
in march  we sold all of our photoblank manufacturing assets located in poughkeepsie  new york  to schott 
we also entered into a supply agreement with schott for a significant portion of our future purchases of photoblanks 
the total proceeds of million were allocated million to the assets sold and million to the supply agreement based on the projected cash flows that will be generated by the supply agreement  discounted to present value 
this transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the value of the supply agreement will be amortized ratably as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the term of the agreement 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was million in and million in the change was caused by a decrease in interest income of million  due to substantially lower interest rates  partially offset by favorable decreases in net foreign exchange losses of million 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our tax expense is based on the statutory rates in effect in the countries in which we operate 
certain of our operations in asia are subject to various tax holidays 
certain tax holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met 
our effective tax rate for was a tax benefit of percent versus a tax expense of percent for our effective tax rate varied from the prior year because of shifts in the geographic distribution of earnings and losses between high and low tax rate countries partially due to the special charges recorded in north america 
additionally  the tax rate was impacted by an adjustment to release the previously provided valuation allowance against certain capital losses  which became realizable upon recognition of the capital gain on the sale of our photoblank manufacturing assets 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate because a substantial portion of our asian manufacturing operations in korea  china  taiwan and singapore operate at a reduced tax rate or free of tax under various tax holidays 
minority interest in income of joint ventures 
the minority interest impact of our joint venture manufacturing facilities was million in compared to million in  reflecting the partners share of income from our joint ventures 
the increase was primarily the result of increased profitability in our china joint venture 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital was million as of june  and million as of june  the increase in working capital was due principally to an increase in cash from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes on may   offset by capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents were million as of june  and million as of june  cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal and million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of reduced profits in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash used in investing activities resulted from lower capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions 
management expects capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million 
capital expenditures have been and will be used primarily to advance our technical capability 
in addition  we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies  or enter into joint venture arrangements  that could complement or expand our business 
any material acquisition or joint venture could result in a decrease to our working capital depending on the amount  timing and nature of the consideration to be paid 
cash provided from financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal proceeds from borrowings  net of issuance costs  increased million in fiscal due to the issuance of million convertible subordinated notes on may  additionally  our employees purchased million of common stock under our employee plans 
in july  we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes were sold at par less an underwriting discount of percent and we received net proceeds of million 
the notes are due in july  with no stated interest  are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  are unconditionally guaranteed by dupont and are not callable by us 
we have reserved  shares of our common stock for conversion of the convertible subordinated notes 
in the event of a fundamental change in our company  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a fundamental change generally is any transaction in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders  although dupont would be required to pay the redemption price under its guarantee 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time 
debt issue costs of million related to these notes are included in non current other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight line method  which approximates the interest method  to interest expense over the scheduled maturity period 
on may   we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
the notes were sold at par less an underwriting discount of percent and we received net proceeds of million 
the notes are due may   will accrue interest at an annual rate of percent and are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year beginning november  we have reserved  shares of our common stock for conversion of the convertible subordinated notes 
if a change of control occurs  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a change of control is any transaction in which a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our common stock or has the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  any consolidation  merger or similar transaction in which our shareholders immediately prior to the transaction hold less than a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the surviving corporation and the consideration in the merger or consolidation is not common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market  or the holders of our capital stock approve any plan or proposal for our liquidation or dissolution 
a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if the last sale price of our common stock for any five trading days during the ten trading days immediately preceding the change of control is at least equal to of the conversion price of the notes 
if a change of control were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time 
debt issue costs of million related to these notes are included in non current other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are amortized using the straight line method  which approximates the interest method  to interest expense over the scheduled maturity period 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement and filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
if we fail to comply with certain of our obligations under the registration rights agreement  additional interest will accrue on the affected notes at an annual rate of percent 
also in connection with the issuance of the notes  we amended our rights agreement dated january   to provide that the issuance of the notes to the initial purchasers would not cause the initial purchasers to be acquiring persons as defined in the rights agreement under the rights agreement and therefore no distribution date as defined in the rights agreement under the rights agreement would occur as a result of the issuance of the notes to the initial purchasers 
our ongoing cash requirements will be for capital expenditures  acquisitions  research and development and working capital 
management believes that cash on hand and any cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
thereafter  based on our current operating plans  we may require external financing from time to time to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
there can be no assurance that alternative sources of financing will be available if our capital requirements exceed cash flow from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional financing required to fund our capital needs on reasonable terms  or at all 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of june  in millions payments due by fiscal period total year two years two years beyond short term and long term borrowings long term convertible notes capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our other commercial commitments as of june  in millions amount of commitment expiration by fiscal period total year two years two years beyond guarantees other commercial commitments total commercial commitments guarantees include our portion of certain equipment leases of the rtc with future minimum lease payments aggregating approximately million as of june  we  along with amd and infineon  have established the maskhouse building administration gmbh co  or bac  which is the owner of a state of the art photomask research manufacturing facility in dresden  germany 
we have guaranteed one third of the bac s construction bridge loan 
the million euro construction bridge loan was executed in june with an original maturity date of june  and was amended and extended in may as described below 
the construction bridge loan had million euro million as of june  outstanding as of june  during december  the bac and amtc executed a facility agreement that included a term loan of million euro million as of june  and a revolving credit facility of million euro million as of june  
as of june   there were no outstanding balances under either the term loan or revolving credit facility 
the term loan will be used to repay the construction bridge loan and the revolving credit facility will be used for equipment purchases 
we have guaranteed one third of the term loan  or up to million euro million as of june   until the bac building is occupied and lease payments begin 
we have also guaranteed up to million euro million as of june  of the revolving credit facility 
each of these guarantees includes certain other costs as defined in the loan agreements 
we will be required to honor our guarantees upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the loan agreements 
both the term loan and the revolving credit facility include a condition precedent requiring european union approval of certain terms prior to initial drawdown 
in may  the construction bridge loan and the revolving credit facility were amended to provide access to funds on an interim basis pending receipt of the european union approval 
the construction bridge loan was amended to extend the final maturity from june  to september   in combination with the maturity date extension  construction bridge loan commitments of million euro were voluntarily canceled by the bac  leaving total commitments of million euro as of may also during may  the revolving credit facility was amended to allow up to million euro million as of june  to be accessed on an interim basis through september there were no amendments to our guarantees in association with the amendments to the construction bridge loan and revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding balances associated with the interim revolving credit facility commitments as of june  in july  we received approval from the european union 
as a result  we expect the term loan and the revolving credit facility to be funded and the construction bridge loan to be repaid during the first quarter of fiscal in may  we entered into an agreement to acquire photomask production equipment from infineon s internal photomask manufacturing operations in munich  germany and become infineon s strategic photomask supplier 
in consideration for the acquisition of certain photomask production assets and the agreement to supply infineon with photomasks over the year term of the agreement  we agreed to pay infineon million over a seven year period ending in march we made the first million payment associated with the agreement in april in addition  we agreed to purchase from infineon additional photomask production equipment for approximately million payable over a five year period ending in december we expect to fund all payments to infineon from cash provided by operations  however  we may elect to satisfy up to approximately million of these amounts by issuing shares of our common stock 
in addition to the commitments in the tables above  we are also committed to fund approximately percent of the costs related to the maintenance and overhead of the leased equipment of the rtc through june additionally  we are committed to fund a portion of the operating cash requirements of the amtc 
we expect our portion to be approximately percent through september and to vary between approximately percent to percent thereafter 
we will lease approximately percent of the bac s photomask research and manufacturing facility for a term of years 
we have also established a profit sharing plan with the bindkey employees 
over the next three years  bindkey employees may earn amounts annually based on the annual after tax earnings of bindkey 
in addition and upon the termination of the final year subject to the profit sharing plan  the employees may earn as much as an additional million based on the after tax earnings of bindkey in the final year 
any amounts earned in relation to the profit sharing plan will be expensed in the period earned 
in addition  in march we sold all of our photoblank manufacturing assets located in poughkeepsie  new york  to schott lithotec ag  or schott 
we also entered into a supply agreement with schott for a significant portion of our future purchases of photoblanks 
we also have various purchase commitments incidental to the normal course of business  including non refundable deposits to purchase equipment 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not at prices in excess of current market 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when both title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  provided that no significant obligations remain 
discounts and rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue during the period they are earned by the customer 
provision is made for an estimate of product returns based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction in revenue 
customarily  our shipping terms are fob or fca shipping point  however  our final terms depend upon the negotiations with our customers 
estimates  specifically sales return allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory and depreciation expense the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we consider trends of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change or if our original estimates are otherwise incorrect  we may have to reduce our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us by a material amount 
we maintain inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based on assumptions of future demands and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are materially less favorable than those projected by management  or if our estimates of market value are later determined to have been materially incorrect  additional inventory writedowns may be required 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to seven years for equipment and to years for buildings 
property and equipment held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the estimated remaining term of the lease 
valuation of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles subject to amortization and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the measurement of any impairment is determined and the carrying value is reduced as appropriate 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data in regard to the charge of million recorded during fiscal for reductions in the carrying value of certain long lived assets held and used in operations 
accounting for income taxes we are required to consider our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate in computing our effective income tax rate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
further  the actual annual amount of taxable income in each tax jurisdiction may differ from the estimates we use to compute the effective tax rate during our first  second and third quarters 
additionally  we evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is not more likely than not 
our income tax provision on the consolidated income statements are impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
this process is complex and involves significant management judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of dupont photomasks  inc and our controlled and wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
entities that are not controlled but on which we can exercise significant influence are recorded under the equity method of accounting 
other matters in the ordinary course of business  we engage in transactions with related parties including dupont  the rtc  amtc  bac and certain of our non north america employees 
transactions with dupont relate primarily to agreements entered into in additionally  million and million of our revenue in china for fiscal and  respectively  was transacted through a dupont subsidiary in order to facilitate the collection of accounts receivable 
we conduct a portion of our research and development projects by funding our proportionate share of the research efforts of the rtc and amtc joint ventures 
additionally  we have receivables from certain of our non north america employees related primarily to housing and automobile loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of june   we had million in non interest bearing convertible subordinated notes  million in convertible subordinated notes and million in interest bearing borrowings of which million were short term borrowings 
as a result  changes in the interest rate market would change the estimated fair value of our long term convertible notes and other interest bearing borrowings 
we believe that a percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exposures are primarily due to non north america operations which are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative value of currencies and restrictive governmental actions 
changes in the relative value of currencies occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  have a material effect on our results of operations 
any exchange rate fluctuations can affect our margins since we may have imbalances between some foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses 
our consolidated financial statements reflect remeasurement of items denominated in non us currencies to non us dollars  our functional currency 
exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur 
we monitor our exchange rate exposure and attempt to reduce such exposure by hedging 
we have entered into forward contracts in currencies of the countries in which we conduct business in order to reduce such exposure 
as of june   the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding was million with an unrealized loss recorded in the consolidated income statement of million for these instruments may involve elements of credit and market risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that a percent change in exchange rates would not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we monitor our positions and the credit quality of counter parties  consisting primarily of major financial institutions  and do not anticipate nonperformance by any counter party  although nonperformance could occur

financial risk management our international revenue are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in local economies  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in the repatriation of earnings  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
some of our sales outside of north america are denominated in local currencies  and accordingly  we are subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
in general  increases in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies decrease the us dollar value of foreign sales requiring us either to increase our price in the local currency  which could render our product prices noncompetitive  or to suffer reduced revenue and gross margins as measured in us dollars 
our foreign currency hedging program is not designed to hedge the margin risks associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
our hedging is comprised of foreign currency forward exchange contracts utilized to mitigate the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet exposures 
however  the hedging program will not eliminate all of our foreign exchange risks 
the marketplace for our products dictates that we maintain inventories of raw materials 
therefore  inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes  shifting customer demand  the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by our competitors or us of products embodying new technology 
while we maintain valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventory and management continues to monitor the adequacy of such valuation allowances  there can be no assurance that such valuation allowances will be sufficient 
as of june   we had outstanding foreign short term borrowings  including capital lease obligations  totaling million 
as of june   we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we were engaged in such relationships 
as of june  we had million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding due in july the notes have no stated interest  are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  are unconditionally guaranteed by dupont and are not callable by us 
in the event of a fundamental change in our company  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a fundamental change generally is any transaction in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market 
if a fundamental change were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders  although dupont would be required to pay the redemption price under its guarantee 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time 
in addition  we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement in may the notes are due may   will accrue interest at an annual rate of percent and are convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year beginning november  if a change of control occurs  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to redeem  in cash  any or all of such holder s notes at a price equal to percent of the principal amount to be redeemed 
a change of control is any transaction in which a person or group becomes the beneficial owner of or more of our common stock or has the power to elect a majority of our board of directors  any consolidation  merger or similar transaction in which our shareholders immediately prior to the transaction hold less than a majority of the outstanding voting stock of the surviving corporation and the consideration in the merger or consolidation is not common stock listed on a national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market  or the holders of our capital stock approve any plan or proposal for our liquidation or dissolution 
if a change of control were to occur  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to pay the redemption price for all the notes tendered by the holders 
in that case  our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  and may constitute a default under the terms of other indebtedness that we may enter into from time to time 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement and filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
if we fail to comply with certain of our obligations under the registration rights agreement  additional interest will accrue on the affected notes at an annual rate of percent
