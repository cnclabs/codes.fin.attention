the following is a summary of net sales by division for the fiscal years ended june  and june  in thousands fiscal year ended june net sales by division of net sales of net sales change broadcast and professional business and consumer total in the fiscal year ended june   the broadcast and professional division represented of our total sales  while the business and consumer division represented of our total sales 
in the fiscal year ended june   the broadcast and professional division represented of our total sales  while the business and consumer division represented of our total sales 

table of contents broadcast and professional sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our servers  several installations of our vortex news systems  increased sales of our live to air production products  the addition of our editing products from product lines acquired from fast in october and increased sales of our team sports systems 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in sales of our content creation products 
business and consumer sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our existing and new versions of our studio  television receiver and edition products  increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from steinberg and increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from vob  which includes our instant product line 
deferred revenue decreased to million as of june  from million as of june  deferred revenue decreased due to the recognition of several large system sales in our broadcast and professional division  since installation was completed and customer acceptance was received 
this decrease was mostly offset by an increase in extended support and maintenance contracts 
the following is a summary of net sales by region for the fiscal years ended june  and june  in thousands fiscal year ended june net sales by region of net sales of net sales change north america international total for the fiscal year ended june  and june   international sales sales outside of north america represented and of our net sales  respectively  while north american sales represented and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total net sales 
international sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  international sales increased primarily due to strong international retail sales  increased sales of our existing and new versions of products in our business and consumer division  increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from steinberg and increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from vob 
north american sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  north american sales increased primarily due to increased sales of our servers  the installations of our vortex news systems in our broadcast and professional division  increased sales of our existing and new versions of products in our business and consumer division  increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from steinberg and increased sales of approximately million resulting from the addition of product lines acquired from vob 
our sales were relatively linear throughout the quarters in fiscal and the first  second and third quarters of fiscal however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of the quarter  and our revenues depended substantially on orders booked during the last month or weeks of the quarter 
in addition  the increase in our large systems sales  the expansion of our distribution channels  or the introduction of new products at the end of a given quarter could require us to recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a given quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter 
cost of sales we distribute and sell our products to users through the combination of independent domestic and international dealers and vars  retail distributors  oems and  to a lesser extent  a direct sales force 
sales to 
table of contents dealers  vars  distributors and oems are generally at a discount to the published list prices 
the amount of discount  and consequently  our net sales less cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  vary depending on the product  the channel of distribution  the volume of product purchased  and other factors 
cost of sales consists primarily of costs related to the procurement of components and subassemblies  labor and overhead associated with procurement  assembly and testing of finished products  inventory management  warehousing  shipping  warranty costs  royalties  and provisions for obsolescence and shrinkage 
our total cost of sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  our total cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  which we recorded in the quarter ended september  as discussed in the section entitled restructuring below  we completed our reorganization in the first quarter of fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  total cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in our total cost of sales  as a percentage of total net sales  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was due to decreased cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  in both the broadcast and professional division and the business and consumer division 
broadcast and professional cost of sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  broadcast and professional cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  which we recorded in the quarter ended september  as a percentage of broadcast and professional net sales  our broadcast and professional cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in broadcast and professional cost of sales  as a percentage of broadcast and professional net sales  was primarily due to lower material costs and a decrease in manufacturing overhead costs  as a percentage of sales  because of more efficient operations 
business and consumer cost of sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of business and consumer net sales  our business and consumer cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in business and consumer cost of sales  as a percentage of business and consumer net sales  was primarily due to a change in product mix which consisted of a higher portion of software products during the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  from our software products is generally lower than cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  from our hardware products 
restructuring during the quarter ended september   we reorganized and merged operations of the broadcast division and the professional media division into one division named the broadcast and professional division 
the new divisions equate to two reportable segments broadcast and professional  and business and consumer 
the reorganization was performed to provide a structure that would allow better focus on our business and reduction of costs 
as part of this reorganization  we consolidated our worldwide accounting function and eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees who were terminated during the quarter ended september  included in the cost of sales for the quarter ended september  was a million inventory charge related to the write down of products used in our vortex news systems  which are included in our broadcast and professional division 
this million inventory charge was recorded in the quarter ended september   and resulted from upgrading our targa product with our targa product a component of our vortex news systems  which is included in our broadcast and professional division 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory related to the targa during the fiscal year ended june   we scrapped million of this previously written down inventory and  as a result  there was no material impact on our results of operations 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products and enhancements of existing products  and consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  prototype and development expenses  depreciation and facility costs 

table of contents engineering and product development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to increased engineering and product development personnel and the acquisition of steinberg in january and vob in october we believe that investment in research and development is crucial to our future growth and position in the industry and expect to continue to allocate significant resources to all of our engineering and product development locations throughout the world 
we expect our engineering and product development expenses to continue to be significant in future periods 
as a percentage of net sales  engineering and product development expenses decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in engineering and product development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to a growth in net sales without a corresponding increase in engineering and product development expenses 
sales  marketing and service sales  marketing and service expenses include compensation and benefits for sales  marketing and customer service personnel  commissions  travel  advertising and promotional expenses including trade shows and professional fees for marketing services 
sales  marketing and service expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to increased personnel  the expansion of our sales operations into broader markets  higher marketing costs associated with the launch of our new products  and the acquisition of steinberg in january as a percentage of net sales  sales  marketing and service expenses decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in sales  marketing and service expenses  as a percentage of net sales  was primarily due to sales increasing at a faster rate than the corresponding sales  marketing and service expenses  since some portion of our sales and marketing expenses are relatively fixed and not variable with changes in sales 
we expect our sales  marketing and service expenses to continue to be significant in future periods 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  executive  finance and management information systems personnel  legal and accounting fees  information technology infrastructure costs  facility costs  and other corporate administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher legal fees related to the athle tech claim  increased personnel costs due to the additional hiring of finance and management personnel  and higher insurance costs for directors and officers  property and general liability 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to an increase in sales without a corresponding increase in general and administrative expenses  due to improved efficiencies in managing our general and administrative expenses 
as discussed in the restructuring section  above  we completed our reorganization in the first quarter of fiscal we did not reorganize our business operations during the fiscal year ended june  amortization of goodwill goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired identifiable net assets exceeded the fair values of those identifiable net assets on the date of purchase 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which we adopted on july  as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized 
the amortization of goodwill decreased to zero in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was the result of our adoption of sfas no 
on july   which required the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 

table of contents we performed the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas no 
as of july  and concluded that goodwill was impaired  as the carrying value of two of our reporting units in the broadcast and professional division exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended september  to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
this charge is a non operating and non cash charge 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   we had approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
as of june   we had approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
we have evaluated the remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets to determine if any adjustments to the useful lives were necessary or if any of these assets had indefinite lives and were  therefore  not subject to amortization 
we determined that no adjustments to the useful lives of our other intangible assets were necessary 
the goodwill impairment test consisted of the two step process as follows in both step and step  below  the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows for each reporting unit 
step we compared the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount  including the existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of july   since the carrying amount of two of our reporting units in the broadcast and professional division exceeded their fair value  the comparison indicated that our reporting units goodwill was impaired see step below 
step for purposes of performing the second step  we used a purchase price allocation methodology to assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets  including intangibles  and liabilities of each of these reporting units  respectively 
the residual fair value after the purchase price allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
at the adoption date  july   the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was less than the carrying amount of goodwill  resulting in a transitional impairment loss of million recorded during the quarter ended september  in accordance with sfas no 
 we will evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant events or changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill has been impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill has been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge 
we have chosen the first quarter of each fiscal year as the date of the annual impairment test 
a goodwill impairment charge may be required if we receive a negative ruling from the des earnout arbitration 
amortization of other intangible assets acquisition related intangible assets result from our acquisition of businesses accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and consist of the values of identifiable intangible assets  including core developed technology  customer related intangibles  trademarks and trade names  assembled workforce  and other identifiable intangibles 
acquisition related intangibles are being amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to six years 
the amortization of our intangible assets decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease in amortization was primarily due to several intangible assets that became fully amortized during the quarter ended september   which was partially offset by an increase in intangible amortization resulting from the acquisition of steinberg in january  the acquisition of vob in october and the acquisition of technology and products from fast in october legal judgment in august  a lawsuit entitled athle tech computer systems  incorporated athle tech v 
montage group  ltd 
montage and digital editing services  inc des  wholly owned subsidiaries of pinnacle was filed referred to as the athle tech claim 
the athle tech claim alleges that montage breached a software development agreement between athle tech and montage 
the athle tech claim also alleges that des intentionally interfered with athle tech s claimed rights with respect to the athle tech agreement and was unjustly enriched as a result 
during a trial in early february  the court found that montage and des were liable to athle tech on the athle tech claim 
the jury rendered a verdict on several counts on february   and on april   the court entered a final judgment of million inclusive of prejudgment interest 
as a result of this verdict  we have accrued million plus million in related legal costs  for a total legal judgment accrual of million as of june  on april   we posted a million 
table of contents bond staying execution of the judgment pending appeal 
in order to secure the million bond  we obtained a letter of credit through one of our financial institutions on april   which expires on april   for million and was classified as restricted cash as of june  in process research and development during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded in process research and development costs of approximately million  related to the acquisition of steinberg 
the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects  and discounting the net cash flows back to the time of acquisition using a risk adjusted discount rate 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income generated from our investments in money market funds  government securities and high grade commercial paper  and foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
interest and other income increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase in interest and other income was primarily due to a foreign currency remeasurement gain of approximately million  resulting from a change in value of one of our intercompany accounts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which was partially offset by lower interest rate yields earned on investments 
income tax expense income taxes are comprised of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  primarily relating to income from our international subsidiaries 
the net deferred tax liabilities as of june  and june  were million and million  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  a valuation allowance of million  of which million was recorded during year ended june   is recorded against the us deferred tax asset  to reduce the net us deferred tax asset to an amount considered to be more likely than not realizable 
the majority of the valuation allowance relates to accrued expenses and allowances  acquired intangibles  and net operating loss carryforwards  which will be benefited as a reduction in tax expense if it is later determined that the related deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance of million relates to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options  which will be credited to stockholders equity when recognized 
the valuation allowance of million relates to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from the acquisition of steinberg media technologies ag  which will reduce goodwill if it is later determined that the related deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years through  if not utilized 
our state net operating loss expires in the years through  if not utilized 
we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million  which have no expiration provision 
in addition  we had federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which expire in through  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which have no expiration provision 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
on july   we no longer amortize goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized 
we performed the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas no 
as of july  and concluded that goodwill was impaired  as the carrying value of two of our reporting units in the broadcast and professional division exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended september  to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
this charge is a non operating and non cash charge 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

table of contents comparison of the years ended june  and net sales overall net sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june   from million in the fiscal year ended june  overall net sales decreased primarily because of the global economic downturn  which mainly impacted our international sales

since a majority of our business and consumer sales are directed toward the consumer  we usually experience an increase in sales during the second quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday buying season

in an effort to reduce costs during the quarter ended december   we effectively shut down our operations for one week during the thanksgiving holiday and for the holiday week during the last week of december this shutdown resulted in the majority of our employees taking vacation during the shutdown periods  which reduced our operating expenses during the quarter ended december  we did not have similar savings during the quarters ended march  and june  deferred revenue increased to million as of june  from million as of june  this increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to an increase in large system sales in our broadcast and professional division 
as of june  and  we billed certain customers for several installments but

we recognize the revenue for these large system sales upon the completion of installation and customer acceptance

our total cost of sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  our total cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal our total cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  total cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in our total cost of sales  as a percentage of total net sales  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  was due to decreased cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  in both the broadcast and professional division and the business and consumer division 
broadcast and professional cost of sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  broadcast and professional cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  which was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal broadcast and professional cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of as a percentage of broadcast and professional net sales  our broadcast and professional cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in broadcast and professional cost of sales  as a percentage of broadcast and professional net sales  was primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing overhead costs  as a percentage of sales  because of more efficient operations and reduced manufacturing spending 
the decrease was also attributable to lower material costs 
business and consumer cost of sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  business and consumer 
table of contents cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  includes a million inventory charge  which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of business and consumer net sales  our business and consumer cost of sales decreased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in business and consumer cost of sales  as a percentage of business and consumer net sales  was primarily due to a change in product mix which consisted of a higher portion of software products during the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  from our software products is generally lower than cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  from our hardware products 
restructuring included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was a million inventory charge related to the write down of products used in our vortex news systems  which are included in our broadcast and professional division 
this million inventory charge was recorded in the quarter ended september   and resulted from upgrading our targa product with our targa product a component of our vortex news systems  which is included in our broadcast and professional division 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory related to the targa as of june   this million of written down inventory had not been scrapped or sold 
included in the cost of sales for the fiscal year ended june  was a million inventory charge  consisting of a million charge and a million charge in the first and fourth quarters  respectively  of the charges related to discontinued products and accessories of which million related to the broadcast and professional division and million related to the business and consumer division 
these inventory charges were part of reorganizations we implemented in each of the first and fourth quarters of fiscal  as described in more detail below and in the section entitled general and administrative 
during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure to facilitate better and more efficient reporting and to increase internal accountability 
in conjunction with this reorganization  we streamlined our product line offerings by discontinuing certain products  including primarily alladin and the g and g versions of the media stream servers  and by writing down excess targa and dvd inventory to its net realizable value 
this resulted in an inventory charge of million to reduce the inventory carrying value to its estimated net realizable value on the secondary parts market 
this inventory was subsequently sold on the secondary parts market for approximately its revised carrying amount 
as a result of this reorganization  we increased the effectiveness of our internal processes and streamlined our product offerings  which we expect will indirectly improve our operating results over time 
we do not expect the reorganization to have a significant direct effect on future earnings 
during the quarter ended june   we reorganized further and streamlined our operations into three divisions the broadcast solutions division  the professional media division and the business and consumer division 
each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we reevaluated our product offerings and better aligned them within our distribution channels 
this reevaluation led to the discontinuance of certain products in an effort to simplify our manufacturing  sales and marketing processes and to more rapidly transition to newer product designs 
as a result  we recorded a million inventory charge to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the discontinued products primarily consisted of certain versions of our pctv  thunder  dc  dc  dv  dv and mp products 
the simplified product lines resulted in improved efficiencies in marketing  sales  and manufacturing 
as of june   most of this inventory had been scrapped or sold on the secondary parts market with no material impact on our results of operations 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products and enhancements of existing products and consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  prototype and development expenses  depreciation and facility costs 
engineering and product development expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to our efforts to reduce engineering expenses commensurate with our lower revenue 
as a percentage of sales  engineering and product development expenses were relatively consistent at in the fiscal year ended june  compared to in the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents sales  marketing  and service sales  marketing  and service expenses include compensation and benefits for sales  marketing and customer service personnel  commissions  travel  advertising and promotional expenses including trade shows and professional fees for marketing services 
sales  marketing and service expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of net sales  sales  marketing and service expenses increased to in the fiscal year ended june  from in the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the broader sales organization that we established in our business and consumer division in an effort to better serve the various local markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  executive  finance and management information systems personnel  legal and accounting fees  information technology infrastructure costs  facility costs  and other corporate administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses were and in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in personnel  which was partially offset by lower reorganization costs incurred during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  as discussed in the cost of sales section  above  we completed reorganizations in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal during the quarter ended september   we reorganized our internal reporting structure by changing the organizational structure in order to facilitate better and more efficient internal reporting of the results of our business units 
this reorganization required a modest reduction in headcount due to the more efficient organizational structure  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of million  consisting primarily of severance for employees who were terminated during the quarter ended september  during the quarter ended june   we reorganized further and streamlined our operations into three distinct divisions the broadcast solutions division  the professional media division and the business and consumer division 
each of these divisions was given full profit and loss responsibility 
as part of this reorganization  which was implemented to reduce operating losses in response to decreased sales  we eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees that were terminated during the quarter 
as a result of this reorganization and a reduction in discretionary spending  we significantly decreased total operating expenses by approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal however  operating expenses increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  net of the acquisition settlement in fiscal  as our business stabilized and returned to growth 
during the quarter ended september   we reorganized and merged operations of the broadcast and professional media divisions into one division named the broadcast and professional division 
the new divisions equate to two reportable segments broadcast and professional  and business and consumer 
the reorganization was performed to provide a structure that would allow better focus on our business and reduction of costs 
as part of this reorganization  we consolidated our worldwide accounting function and eliminated certain redundant positions  resulting in involuntary termination expenses of approximately million related to severance and associated costs related to employees who were terminated during the quarter ended september  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets acquisition related intangible assets result from our acquisitions of businesses accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and consist of the values of identifiable intangible assets including core developed technology  assembled work force  trade names  customer related intangibles  trademarks  favorable contracts as well as goodwill 
goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired identifiable net assets exceeded the fair values of those identifiable net assets on the date of purchase 
as of june   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million  compared to million as of june  acquisition related intangibles are being amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to nine years 
the amortization increased to million in the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase is primarily related to the amortization of approximately million of additional goodwill  which we recorded in april in connection with our buyout of the earnout payments otherwise payable to the former montage shareholders  the amortization resulting from the technology and products that we acquired from fast in october and the dvd authoring technology that we acquired from minerva networks  inc in december in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we fully adopted on july  upon adoption  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
is effective with respect to business combinations in fiscal  and as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill for any acquisitions completed since july  sfas no 
requires that we evaluate our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant events or changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill has been impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill has been impaired  we recognize an impairment charge 
we have chosen the first quarter of each fiscal year as the date of the annual impairment test 
acquisition settlement on september   we agreed to compensate certain former shareholders and option holders of avid sports  inc because of the drop in the market price of our common stock immediately after the acquisition 
if the closing price of our common stock did not equal or exceed per share for four consecutive trading days prior to may   the value of the compensation to be paid was to equal the number of shares issued and options assumed in the acquisition  and  respectively multiplied by the difference between our average closing stock price during the month of may  and per share 
the former shareholders of avid sports  inc were to be compensated in shares of our common stock while the former option holders were to be compensated in cash 
on september   we recorded a charge of million  which represented the fair value of the arrangement on september   including million in transaction fees 
this charge included a liability of million which represented the estimated cash payout to the option holders with the remaining million  determined using the black scholes method  recorded as an increase in common stock 
our share price did not reach the target level and therefore  in june  we issued  additional shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of avid sports  inc  and paid an aggregate of million in cash to the former option holders of avid sports  inc the difference between the estimated cash payout to the former option holders of avid sports  inc at september  of million and the actual payment in june was recorded as a reduction to lower the initial charge to the final expense of million 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income generated from our investments in money market funds  government securities and high grade commercial paper 
interest and other income increased approximately to million in the fiscal year ended june   from million in the fiscal year ended june  this increase was primarily due to a higher invested balance  which was partially offset by a one time interest payment that we made in august to a certain customer in connection with the cancellation of a sales contract 
income tax expense income taxes are comprised of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
we incurred a tax expense in the fiscal year ended june  primarily because of income from our international subsidiaries 
we incurred a tax expense in fiscal primarily because of the increase in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of june   we had provided a valuation allowance for our net us deferred tax assets  as we were unable to conclude that all of the deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized 
the total valuation allowance was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years through  if not utilized 
our state net operating loss expires in the years through  if not utilized 
in addition  we had federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which expire in the years through  and state research and experimentation credit carryforwards of million  which have no expiration provision 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash balances as of june   and are summarized as follows in thousands as of june  cash and cash equivalents in addition to cash and cash equivalents  shown above  we had restricted cash and short term marketable securities as follows in thousands as of june  restricted cash short term marketable securities total restricted cash and short term marketable securities cash and cash equivalents were million as of june   compared to million as of june  cash and cash equivalents of million as of june  do not include million of cash that was generated from operations but classified as restricted cash on our balance sheet as of june   since the funds are restricted for the athle tech claim see the section above entitled legal judgment 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to an increase of million during the fiscal year ended june  we have funded our operations to date through sales of equity securities as well as through cash flows from operations 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances as well as anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our current operations and growth for at least the next twelve months 
operating activities our operating activities for the fiscal years ended june  and are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended june  operating activities cash provided by operating activities our operating activities generated cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   which does not include the million that was generated from operating activities but restricted for the athle tech claim  compared to generating cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash generated from operations of million during the fiscal year ended june   which does not include the million that was generated from operating activities but restricted for the athle tech claim  was primarily attributable to our net loss adjusted for excluding non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  in process research and development  and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the goodwill impairment that resulted from our adoption of sfas no 
on july  also contributing to this generated cash from operations was a significant increase in accrued expenses  in addition to an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in inventories  which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivables and prepaid expenses  and a decrease in deferred revenue 
the significant increase in accrued expenses was primarily attributable to the accrual of the athle tech claim see section entitled legal judgment above 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence caused by  among other things  rapidly changing technology  customer requirements and change in demand 
as discussed in the section entitled cumulative effect of change in accounting principle above  we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended september  to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill 
as discussed in the section entitled in process research and development above  we recorded in process research and development costs of million  related to our acquisition of steinberg  during the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents cash generated from operations of million during the fiscal year ended june  was attributable to a significant decrease in accounts receivable and inventories  and an increase in deferred revenues and accrued income taxes  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
as a result  we maintained positive cash flows from operations  despite incurring a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  the significant decrease in our accounts receivable was the result of more linear sales and more effective cash management and collections 
the increase in our deferred revenues was the result of receiving some advance payments on several large system sales  which we recorded as deferred revenue 
we cannot reasonably expect accounts receivable to continue to decrease at this rate and we expect that our accounts receivable may increase in the future 
investing activities our investing activities for the fiscal years ended june  and are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended june  investing activities cash used for investing activities our investing activities consumed cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to consuming cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash consumed by investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to the purchase of marketable securities and the cash payments for the acquisitions of steinberg in january and vob in october  which were partially offset by the proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities 
cash was also consumed for the purchase of property and equipment 
cash consumed from investing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was due to the purchase of marketable securities  a cash payment for the acquired technology and products from fast  and the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities our financing activities for the fiscal years ended june  and are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended june  financing activities cash provided by financing activities our financing activities generated cash of million during the fiscal year ended june   compared to generating cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  cash generated from financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was due to the exercise of employee stock options and the proceeds from the purchase of our common stock through the employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
cash generated from financing activities of million during the fiscal year ended june  was due to the exercise of employee stock options and the proceeds from the purchase of our common stock through the espp 
stock option exchange program in november  we offered a voluntary stock option exchange program to certain eligible employees  which provided these employees with the opportunity to tender their existing stock options in exchange for an equal number of replacement options to be granted in june  with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date that the new options were granted 
these elections were required to be made by december   and were required to include all options granted to the electing employee during the prior six month period 
a total of employees elected to participate in the stock option exchange 
table of contents program 
of the  stock options that were eligible to be tendered   options  or  were tendered in december  on june   we granted an aggregate of  replacement options to those employees who had been continuously employed by us from the date they tendered their options through the grant date 
only our employees who lived and worked in the united states  germany  japan or the united kingdom  and who were employed by us as of  or prior to  the commencement of the offer  were eligible to participate 
directors  executive officers and certain other officers were not eligible to participate in the stock option exchange program 
lease obligations we lease facilities and vehicles under non cancelable operating leases 
future minimum lease payments are as follows in thousands for the fiscal years ending june thereafter total operating lease obligations the lease obligation disclosure  above  represents a five year period from july  through june  and any lease obligations thereafter 
rent expense for the fiscal years ended june   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
in january  we acquired steinberg  a company based in hamburg  germany 
as a result of this acquisition  we assumed capital lease obligations for office equipment including copy machines and telephone systems 
as of june   our total capital lease obligations were million  which were long term in nature and expire in february customer indemnification from time to time  we agree to indemnify our customers against liability if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
as of june   we were not subject to any pending litigation alleging that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of any third parties 
other contractual obligations our contractual obligations  other than operating leases  include purchase orders related to the procurement of materials that are required to produce our products for sale 
currently  we do not have any other long term obligations  or contractual cash obligations 
the most significant contractual financial obligations we have  other than specific balance sheet liabilities and facility leases  are the purchase order po commitments we place with vendors and subcontractors to procure and guarantee a supply of the electronic components required to manufacture our products for sale 
we place pos with our vendors on an ongoing basis based on our internal sales forecasts 
the amount of outstanding pos can range from the value of material required to supply one half of the sales in a quarter to as much as the full amount needed for a quarter 
as of june   the amount of outstanding pos was approximately million 
the total amount of these commitments can vary from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the total amount of expected future sales  lead times in the electronic components markets  the mix of projected sales and the mix of components required for those sales 
most of these pos are firm commitments that cannot be canceled  though some pos can be rescheduled without penalty and some can be completely canceled with little or no penalty 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  product returns  accounts receivable and bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the financial impact of these estimates and judgments is reviewed by management on an ongoing basis at the end of each quarter prior to public release of our financial results 
management believes that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets valuation of inventory deferred tax asset valuation allowance revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of products  including both hardware and perpetual software licenses and  to a lesser extent  from product support and services including product support contracts  installation and training services 
we generally recognize revenues from sales of products upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if applicable to the sales transaction  revenue is only recorded if the revenue recognition criteria of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
revenue from post contract customer support pcs is recognized ratably over the contractual term typically one year 
installation and training revenue is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
for systems with complex installation processes where installation is considered essential to the functionality of the product for example  when the services can only be performed by us  product and installation revenue is deferred until completion of the installation 
for shrink wrapped products with telephone support and bug fixes bundled in as part of the original sale  revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment and the costs to provide this telephone support and bug fixes are accrued  as these costs are deemed insignificant 
shipping and handling costs associated with amounts billed to customers are included in revenue 
revenue from certain channel partners is subject to arrangements allowing limited rights of return  stock rotation  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection when given and rebates when offered  at the time the related revenue is recorded 
to estimate future product returns and reserves for rebates and price protection  we analyze historical returns and credits  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  inventory levels in the distribution channel and general marketplace acceptance of our products 
to the extent that we have contracts for sales to channel partners who have unlimited return rights  revenue is recognized when the product is sold through to a customer 

table of contents we record oem licensing revenue  primarily royalties  when oem partners ship products incorporating pinnacle software  provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable 
our systems sales frequently involve multiple element arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of hardware product  pcs  and or professional services 
for multiple element arrangements revenue is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
when evidence of fair value exists for each of the undelivered elements but not for the delivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue for the delivered elements 
under this method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred until delivered and the remaining portion of the revenue is recognized 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements does not exist  then revenue is only recognized when delivery of those elements has occurred or fair value has been established 
fair value is based on the prices charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
except for large systems sales  our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or a certain event  such as achievement of system on air status  which contractually constitutes acceptance 
deferred revenue includes customer advances  pcs maintenance revenue  and invoiced fees from arrangements where revenue recognition criteria are not yet met 
management is required to make and apply significant judgments and estimates in connection with the recognition of revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management were to make different judgments or apply different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
we record an allowance for receivables based on a percentage of accounts receivable 
additionally  individual overdue accounts are reviewed  and an additional allowance is recorded when determined necessary to state receivables at realizable value 
in estimating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience  the general economic environment  and the aging of our receivables 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our bad debt expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or apply different estimates 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we review goodwill annually for impairment 
factors we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period our market capitalization relative to net book value as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
in july  we no longer amortize goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized 
we performed the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas no 
as of july  and concluded that goodwill was impaired  as the carrying value of two of our reporting units in the broadcast and professional division exceeded their fair value 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the quarter ended september  to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
this charge is a non operating 
table of contents and non cash charge 
this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   we had approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
as of june   we had approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
we have evaluated the remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets to determine if any adjustments to the useful lives were necessary or if any of these assets had indefinite lives and were  therefore  not subject to amortization 
we determined that no adjustments to the useful lives of our other intangible assets were necessary 
the goodwill impairment test consisted of the two step process as follows in both step and step  below  the fair value of each reporting unit was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows for each reporting unit 
step we compared the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount  including the existing goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of july   since the carrying amount of two of our reporting units in the broadcast and professional division exceeded their fair value  the comparison indicated that our reporting units goodwill was impaired see step below 
step for purposes of performing the second step  we used a purchase price allocation methodology to assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets  including intangibles  and liabilities of each of these reporting units  respectively 
the residual fair value after the purchase price allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
at the adoption date  july   the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was less than the carrying amount of goodwill  resulting in a transitional impairment loss of million recorded during the quarter ended september  in accordance with sfas no 
 we will evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant events or changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill has been impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill has been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge 
we have chosen the first quarter of each fiscal year as the date of the annual impairment test 
a goodwill impairment charge may be required if we receive a negative ruling from the des earnout arbitration 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the valuation of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of an impairment charge or amortization expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or apply different estimates 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory is purchased as a result of the monthly internal demand forecast that we produce  which drives the issuance of purchase orders with our suppliers 
we capitalize all labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
inventory is reviewed quarterly and written down to adjust for excess or obsolete material 
we identify excess material by comparing the internal demand forecasts  based on product sales forecasts  to current inventory levels 
inventory that is deemed to be excess is written down to its estimated resale value in the secondary material resale market or to zero if there is no resale value 
inventory is identified as obsolete if we discontinue the use of a specific inventory item 
inventory that is deemed to be obsolete is written down to its estimated resale value or to zero if it has no resale value 
active inventory is written down to its net realizable value if the sales price falls below our carrying value 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the valuation of our inventory 
material differences may result in the amount of our cost of sales for any period if we were to make different judgments or apply different estimates 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through june   we believe it is more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets will not be 
table of contents realized and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one period or over many periods if the recovered deferred tax assets related to continued operations 
a credit to shareholders equity would result if the reduction of the valuation allowance were related to tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options 
if the reduction of the valuation allowance were related to any acquired companies  the credit would be to goodwill 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we apply sfas no 
to any exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we did not have any exit or disposal activities after december   therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the scope of eitf but believe that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin no

factors that could affect future results there are various factors that may cause our future net revenues and operating results to fluctuate 
as a result  quarter to quarter variations could result in a substantial decrease in our stock price if our net revenues and operating results are below analysts expectations 
our net revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include 
table of contents adverse changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business  including the recent slow down affecting north america  europe  asia pacific and potentially other geographic areas  increased competition and pricing pressure  the timing of significant orders from and shipments to major customers  including oems and our large broadcast accounts  the timing and market acceptance of new products and upgrades  the timing of customer acceptance on large system sales  our success in developing  marketing and shipping new products  our dependence on the distribution channels through which our products are sold  the accuracy of our and our resellers forecasts of end user demand  the accuracy of inventory forecasts  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies from our subcontractors on a timely basis  the timing and level of consumer product returns  foreign currency fluctuations  delays and costs associated with the integration of acquired operations  the introduction of new products by major competitors  and intellectual property infringement claims by or against us 
we also experience significant fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal fluctuations  the timing of major trade shows and the sale of consumer products in anticipation of the holiday season 
sales usually slow down during the summer months of july and august  especially in our business and consumer division in europe 
also  we attend a number of annual trade shows  which can influence the order pattern of products  including cebit in march  the nab convention in april and the ibc convention in september 
our operating expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations of future revenue 
such future revenue levels are difficult to forecast 
any shortfall in our quarterly net sales would have a disproportionate  negative impact on our quarterly net income 
the resulting quarter to quarter variations in our revenues and operating results could create uncertainty about the direction or progress of our business  which could cause our stock price to decline 
due to these factors  our future net revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
deteriorating market conditions and continued economic uncertainty could materially adversely impact our revenues and growth rate 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  individuals and companies have delayed or reduced expenditures  as we experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal although our sales increased in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal from the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  our revenue growth and profitability depend primarily on the overall demand for our products 
if demand for these products decreases due to ongoing economic uncertainty  this may result in decreased revenues  earnings levels or growth rates 
if united states or international economic conditions worsen  demand for our products may weaken  and our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price may be materially adversely affected as a result 
we recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a given quarter 
our sales were relatively linear throughout the quarters in fiscal and the first  second and third quarters of fiscal however  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of the quarter  and our revenues depended substantially on orders booked during the last month or weeks of the quarter 
we also expect to recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of the first quarter of fiscal the increase in our large systems sales  the expansion of our distribution channels  or the introduction of new products at the end of a given quarter could 
table of contents require us to recognize a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month or weeks of a given quarter 
this makes it difficult for us to accurately predict total sales for the quarter until late in the quarter 
if certain sales cannot be closed during those last weeks  sales may be recognized in subsequent quarters 
this may cause our quarterly revenues to fall below analysts expectations 
our revenues  particularly in the broadcast and professional division  are becoming increasingly dependent on large broadcast system sales to a few significant customers 
our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if sales are delayed or not completed within a given quarter or if any of our significant broadcast customers terminate their relationship or contracts with us  modify their requirements  which may delay installation and revenue recognition  or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us 
we expect sales of large broadcast systems to a few significant customers to continue to constitute a material portion of our net revenues  particularly as broadcasters transition from tape based systems to information technology based systems 
our quarterly and annual revenues could fluctuate significantly if sales to one or more of our significant customers are delayed or are not completed within a given quarter  the contract terms preclude us from recognizing revenue during that quarter  we are unable to provide any of our major customers with products in a timely manner and on competitive pricing terms  any of our major customers experience competitive  operational or financial difficulties  if the transition from tape based systems to information technology based systems slows  any of our major customers terminate their relationship with us or significantly reduce the amount of business they do with us  and any of our major customers reduce their capital investments in our products in response to slowing economic growth 
if we are unable to complete anticipated transactions within a given quarter  our revenues may fall below the expectations of market analysts and our stock price could decline 
we incurred losses in fiscal and fiscal we may generate losses in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded net losses of approximately million  which included acquisition related amortization charges 
in fiscal  we recorded net losses of approximately million  which included acquisition related amortization charges  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to goodwill  the legal judgment related to the athle tech claim  and in process research and development costs related to the acquisition of steinberg media technologies ag 
we expect to incur a net loss in the first quarter of fiscal if current economic conditions remain unfavorable or decline further  if our revenues grow at a slower rate than in the past or decline  or if our expenses increase without a commensurate increase in our revenues  we may incur net losses during the remaining quarters of fiscal  and our results of operations and the price of our common stock may decline as a result 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired  rendering their carrying amounts unrecoverable  and  as a result  we may be required to record a substantial impairment charge that would adversely affect our financial position 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
on july   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during the quarter ended september  as of june   we had approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will evaluate  on an annual basis or whenever significant events or changes occur in our business  whether our goodwill has been impaired 
the recent general economic slowdown has adversely affected demand for our products  increasing the likelihood that our goodwill and other intangible assets will become impaired 
if we determine that our goodwill has been impaired  we will recognize an impairment charge that could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we have chosen the first quarter of each fiscal year as the date of the annual impairment test 
a goodwill impairment charge may be required if we receive a negative ruling from the des earnout arbitration 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past  and could in the future  fluctuate significantly 
these fluctuations have been  or could be  in response to numerous factors  including quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or our competitors  changes in securities analysts recommendations  announcements of acquisitions  changes in earnings estimates made by independent analysts  and general stock market fluctuations 
our revenues and results of operations for any given quarter or year may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts or investors 
this could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in july  we announced that financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which ended june   and provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal that was below the then current analyst consensus estimates for the first quarter of fiscal in the day following this announcement  our share price lost more than of its value 
our shares continue to trade in a price range lower than the range held by our shares just prior to this announcement 
with the advent of the internet  new avenues have been created for the dissemination of information 
we do not have control over the information that is distributed and discussed on electronic bulletin boards and investment chat rooms 
the motives of the people or organizations that distribute such information may not be in our best interest or in the interest of our shareholders 
this  in addition to other forms of investment information  including newsletters and research publications  could result in a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices for high technology companies have been particularly affected by these market fluctuations and such effects have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been brought against the issuing company 
this type of litigation has been brought against us in the past and could be brought against us in the future 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and would likely divert management s attention and resources from the day to day operations of our business 
any adverse determination in such litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
we may be obligated to pay a purchase price adjustment in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of scm microsystems  inc and dazzle multimedia  inc pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated june  among us  scm microsystems  inc and dazzle multimedia  inc  we acquired certain assets of scm microsystems and dazzle multimedia in exchange for  shares of our common stock and agreed to register these shares for resale by scm microsystems 
according to the terms of the asset purchase agreement  in the event that the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by scm microsystems exceed  scm microsystems would be required to pay us an amount equal to any proceeds in excess of such amount 
however  in the event that the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by scm microsystems amount to less than  we agreed to pay scm microsystems the difference between  and the proceeds received by scm microsystems in cash 
given the decline in the market price of our common stock since july   the closing date of the acquisition  we may be obligated to pay scm microsystems pursuant to the purchase price adjustment provisions of the asset purchase agreement depending on the then current market price of our common stock 
also  there may be additional purchase price adjustments for inventory and backlog 
if we do not compete effectively against other companies in our target markets  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
we compete in the broadcast  professional  business and consumer video production markets 
each of these markets is highly competitive and diverse  and the technologies for our products can change rapidly 
the competitive nature of these markets results in pricing pressure and drives the need to incorporate product upgrades and accelerate the release of new products 
new products are introduced frequently and existing 
table of contents products are continually enhanced 
we anticipate increased competition in each of the broadcast  professional  business and consumer video production markets  particularly since the industry continues to undergo a period of rapid technological change and consolidation 
competition for our broadcast  professional  business and consumer video products is generally based on product performance  breadth of product line  quality of service and support  market presence and brand awareness  price  and ability of competitors to develop new  higher performance  lower cost consumer video products 
certain competitors in the broadcast  professional  business and consumer video markets have larger financial  technical  marketing  sales and customer support resources  greater name recognition and larger installed customer bases than we do 
in addition  some competitors have established relationships with current and potential customers of ours  and offer a wide variety of video equipment that can be bundled in certain large system sales 
finally  our oem customers could design competitive products  making it unnecessary to incorporate our products into theirs 
for example  we had approximately million in sales to a particular oem customer during fiscal this customer is in the process of developing its own technology to replace the product that it has purchased from us in prior quarters 
consequently  we expect future sales to this particular customer to decrease significantly by fiscal while this customer s sales volume did not decrease or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations during fiscal  future significant decreases in customers volumes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our principal competitors in the broadcast and professional markets include accom  inc avid technology  inc chyron corporation leitch technology corporation matsushita electric industrial co 
ltd 
media  inc quantel ltd 
seachange corporation sony corporation thomson multimedia our principal competitors in the business and consumer markets are adobe systems  inc apple computer avid technology  inc hauppauge digital  inc matrox electronics systems  ltd 
microsoft corporation roxio  inc sony corporation these lists are not all inclusive 
increased competition in the broadcast  professional  business or consumer markets could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
if we cannot compete effectively in these markets by offering products that are comparable in functionality  ease of use and price to those of our competitors  our revenues will decrease and our operating results will be adversely affected 
because we sell products internationally  we are subject to additional risks 
sales of our products outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the quarter ended june   of net sales in the quarter ended march   of net sales in the quarter ended december  and of net sales in the quarter ended september  sales of our products 
table of contents outside of north america represented approximately of net sales in the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of net sales in the fiscal year ended june  we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales 
we make foreign currency denominated sales in many  primarily european  countries 
this exposes us to risks associated with currency exchange fluctuations 
we expect that in fiscal and beyond  a majority of our european sales will continue to be denominated in local currencies  primarily the euro 
we have developed natural hedges for some of this risk since most of the european operating expenses are also denominated in local currency 
as these local currencies  and especially the euro  fluctuate in value against the us dollar  our sales  cost of sales  expenses and income may fluctuate when translated back into us dollars 
we attempt to minimize these foreign exchange exposures by taking advantage of natural hedge opportunities 
in addition  we continually assess the need to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
in the year ended june   a change in value of one of our intercompany accounts resulted in a foreign currency remeasurement gain of million  which we recorded as other income in our consolidated financial statements 
we entered into forward contracts during the quarter ended june  to mitigate the change in value of this intercompany account in the future and marked the forward exchange contracts to market through income in accordance with sfas no 
in future periods  gains and losses on the contracts will materially offset the gains and losses on remeasurement of this intercompany account 
as of june   we had forward contracts to sell million euro at an average rate of 
all forward contracts have durations of less than months 
as of june   our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term marketable securities balance totaled approximately million  with approximately million located in the us and approximately million located at international locations 
our cash balance from international operations included various foreign currencies  primarily the euro  but also included the british pound and japanese yen 
our operational structure is such that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can impact and cause fluctuations in our cash balances 
in addition to foreign currency risks  our international sales and operations may also be subject to the following risks unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and potential insolvency of international dealers and difficulty in collecting accounts 
we are also subject to the risks of changing economic conditions in other countries around the world 
these risks may harm our future international sales and  consequently  our business 
if our products do not keep pace with the technological developments in the rapidly changing video production industry  our business may be materially adversely affected 
the video production industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies or the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
for example  the broadcast market is currently undergoing a transition from tape based systems to information technology based systems 
demand for our products may decrease if this transition slows or if we are unable to adapt to the next generation of industry standards 
in addition  our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to introduce new features and increased functionality for our existing products  improve the performance of existing products  respond to our competitors new product offerings and adapt to new industry standards and requirements 
delays in the introduction or shipment of new or enhanced products  our inability to timely develop and introduce such new products  the failure of such products to gain significant market acceptance or problems associated with new product transitions could materially harm our business  particularly on a quarterly basis 
we are critically dependent on the successful introduction  market acceptance  manufacture and sale of new products that offer our customers additional features and enhanced performance at competitive prices 
once a 
table of contents new product is developed  we must rapidly commence volume production 
this process requires accurate forecasting of customer requirements and attainment of acceptable manufacturing costs 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires us to manage the transition from older  displaced products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
in addition  as is typical with any new product introduction  quality and reliability problems may arise 
any such problems could result in reduced bookings  manufacturing rework costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable  additional service warranty costs and limited market acceptance of the product 
we are dependent on contract manufacturers and single or limited source suppliers for our components 
if these manufacturers and suppliers do not meet our demand  either in volume or quality  our business and financial condition could be materially harmed 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture our professional and consumer products and the major subassemblies of our broadcast products 
we and our manufacturing subcontractors are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for a number of components and parts used in our products  including certain key integrated circuits 
our strategy to rely on subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process  potential absence of adequate manufacturing capacity  potential delays in lead times  unavailability of certain process technologies  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and cost  and unexpected increases in component costs 
as a result of these risks  the financial stability of  and our continuing relationships with  our subcontractors and single or limited source suppliers are important to our success 
if any significant subcontractor or single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these subassemblies or provide critical components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available and product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
this could materially harm our business 
any extended interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the products  subassemblies or components manufactured by third party subcontractors or suppliers could materially harm our business 
we must retain key employees to remain competitive 
if certain of our key employees leave or are no longer able to perform services for us  this could materially and adversely affect our business 
we believe that the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key technical personnel are very important to our continued success 
as a result  our success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel 
we may not be able to retain our key technical and managerial employees or attract  assimilate and retain such other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel as are required in the future 
for example  as of june   we had fewer than  shares available for option grants to our officers  as the proposal to increase the number of shares reserved under our stock option plan was not approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders 
also  employees may leave our employ and subsequently compete against us  or contractors may perform services for competitors of ours 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
any failure to successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired or which we acquire in the future could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
over the past three years  we have acquired a number of businesses and technologies and expect to continue to make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
in july  we acquired a interest in jungle kk  a privately held distribution company in tokyo  japan 
in july  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of scm microsystems  inc and dazzle multimedia  inc 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of steinberg media technologies ag  based in hamburg  germany 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of vob computersysteme gmbh  based in dortmund  germany 
in october  we acquired the business and substantially all of the assets  and assumed certain liabilities  of 
table of contents fast multimedia holdings inc and fast multimedia ag  based in munich  germany 
in december  we acquired dvd authoring technology from minerva 
in june  we acquired avid sports  inc and propel 
in april  we acquired montage 
in march  we acquired des and puffin 
in august  we acquired the video communications division of hp 
we may in the near or long term pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
integrating acquired operations is a complex  time consuming and potentially expensive process 
all acquisitions involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include distracting management from the day to day operations of our business  costs  delays and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations  products and personnel  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of new businesses and management personnel  potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  and incurring debt and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may be adversely affected if we are subject to intellectual property disputes or litigation 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights involving technology companies 
companies are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that may extend the ability to obtain such patents  which may result in an increase in the number of patent infringement claims 
we are also exposed to litigation arising from disputes in the ordinary course of business 
this litigation  regardless of its validity  may be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management s attention away from the operation of our business  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  and require us to stop manufacturing or selling or to redesign our products 
any of these results could materially harm our business 
in the course of business  we have received communications asserting that our products infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
we are currently investigating the factual basis of any such communications and will respond accordingly 
it is likely that  in the course of our business  we will receive similar communications in the future 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more of our products  or relating to current or future technologies  we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
these disputes may not be settled on commercially reasonable terms and may result in long and costly litigation 
in the event there is a successful claim of patent infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in cases where we may choose to avoid litigation and agree to certain royalty terms  the payment of those royalties could have a material impact on our financial results 
the magnitude of such royalties would be even higher if they pertained to intellectual property contained within our consumer products since the volume and numbers of consumer products sold by the company have increased significantly during the last few years 
we may be adversely affected if we initiate intellectual property litigation 
it may be necessary for us to initiate litigation against other companies in order to protect the patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other intellectual property rights owned by us 
such litigation can be costly and there can be no assurance that companies involved in such litigation would be prevented from using our intellectual property 
in addition  such actions could divert management s attention away from the operation of our business  result in costly litigation that could materially affect our financial results  and result in the loss of our proprietary rights 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our proprietary information and procedures effectively 
we must protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  we generally enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and oem customers and limit access to  and distribution of  our proprietary technology 
these steps may not adequately protect our proprietary information nor give us any competitive advantage 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets 
additionally  policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary technology is costly and time consuming  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business could be materially harmed 
we rely on dealers  vars and oems to market  sell and distribute many of our products 
in turn  we depend heavily on the success of these resellers 
if these resellers are not successful in selling our products or if we are not successful in opening up new distribution channels  our financial performance will be negatively affected 
a significant portion of our sales are sourced  developed and closed through dealers  vars and oems 
we believe that these resellers have a substantial influence on customer purchase decisions  especially purchase decisions by large enterprise customers 
these resellers may not effectively promote or market our products or may experience financial difficulties or even close operations 
in addition  our dealers and retailers are not contractually obligated to sell our products 
therefore  they may  at any time  refuse to promote or distribute our products 
also  since many of our distribution arrangements are non exclusive  our resellers may carry our competitors products and could discontinue our products in favor of our competitors products 
also  since these distribution channels exist between us and the actual market  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand for products and anticipate demand for newly introduced products 
for example  dealers may place large initial orders for a new product based on their forecasted demand  which may or may not materialize 
with respect to consumer product offerings  we have expanded our distribution network to include several consumer channels  including large distributors of products to computer software and hardware retailers  which in turn sell products to end users 
we also sell our consumer products directly to certain retailers 
our consumer product distribution network exposes us to the following risks  some of which are out of our control we are obligated to provide price protection to our retailers and distributors and  while the agreements limit the conditions under which product can be returned to us  we may be faced with product returns or price protection obligations  these distributors or retailers may not continue to stock and sell our consumer products  and retailers and distributors often carry competing products 
as a result of these risks  we could experience unforeseen variability in our revenues and operating results 
excess or obsolete inventory  and overdue or uncollectible accounts receivables  could weaken our cash flow  harm our financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to fall 
the downturn in the global economy contributed to a reduced demand for some of our products in fiscal although our sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  if the economy experiences a double dip recession or if our industry experiences a decline during fiscal or beyond  we may experience increased exposure to excess and obsolete inventories and higher overdue and uncollectible accounts receivables 
if we fail to properly manage these inventory and accounts receivables risks  our cash flow may be weakened  and our financial position and results of operations could be harmed as a result 
this  in turn  may cause our stock price to fall 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fixed income investments our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest primarily in united states treasury notes and high grade commercial paper and generally hold them to maturity 
consequently  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 

table of contents we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is two years 
our guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue as well as the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines  we do not expect that our exposure to market and credit risk will be material 
foreign currency hedging our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from intercompany accounts between the parent company in the united states and its foreign subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary in order to centralize foreign exchange risk with the parent company in the united states 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars for consolidation purposes 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and may adversely impact our overall financial results 
we attempt to minimize these foreign exchange exposures by taking advantage of natural hedge opportunities 
in addition  we continually assess the need to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
in the year ended june   a change in value of one of our intercompany accounts resulted in a foreign currency remeasurement gain of million  which we recorded as other income in our consolidated financial statements 
we entered into forward exchange contracts during the quarter ended june  to mitigate the change in value of this intercompany account in the future and marked the forward exchange contracts to market through income in accordance with sfas no 
in future periods  gains and losses on the contracts will materially offset the gains and losses on remeasurement of this intercompany account 
as of june   we had forward contracts to sell million euro at an average rate of 
all forward contracts have durations of less than months
