the information in this report is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in our common stock 
we urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports filed with the sec 
the section entitled risk factors set forth in this report  and similar discussions in our other sec filings  discuss some of the important risk factors that may affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
you should carefully consider those risks  in addition to the other information in this report and in our other filings with the sec  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting policies  which may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customer s credit worthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
sales returns and allowances 
we establish  upon shipment of our products  a provision for estimated returns 
under certain circumstances we allow our customers to return products and a provision is made for such returns 
our estimate of product returns is based on contractual terms or sales agreements  historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net revenue and gross profit  should we experience increased product returns 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we may record charges to write down inventories due to excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory based on an analysis of the impact of changes in technology  the timing of these changes and our estimate of forecasted demand for our products 
we typically use a six month rolling forecast based on anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog 
we assess our current or committed inventory levels to these forecasts on a regular basis and any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased writedowns  resulting in decreased gross profit 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the communications industry  are present 
we also evaluate long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired and if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of the analysis 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required 
litigation and contingencies 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights 
in certain cases  we have accrued estimates of the amounts we expect to pay upon resolution of such matters 
should we not be able to secure the terms we expect  these estimates may change and may result in increased accruals  resulting in decreased profit 
overview we provide system level products that enable broadband communications to the home and business enterprise 
we serve the dsl and the voice over packet markets 
our current customers are broadband access equipment vendors who manufacture dsl equipment for use in the phone companies communications infrastructure or in the customer premise for internet or other network access in a home or small business 
our customers also include equipment vendors who supply products that allow convergence of data and voice networks 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our dsl and voice over packet network products  which include the copperflite co  copperflite cpe  optimizer  palladia  and entropia families of products 
to date  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december   nec and sumitomo electric industries represented and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   sumitomo electric industries and nec represented and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   lucent technologies  sumitomo electric industries  copper mountain networks  nec and nortel networks represented    and  of our revenues  respectively 
we have focused our sales and marketing efforts on asian and north american communications equipment manufacturers 
during the years ended december    and   and of our revenues  respectively  were from customers in asia 
revenues from our customers in asia increased in compared to primarily due to the broad market acceptance and use of our dsl products in japan 
revenues from our customers in north america decreased in and primarily due to decreases in spending in the communications equipment industry 
we currently sell through our direct sales force in china  japan  north america  the united kingdom and south korea 
we also utilize sales representatives in china  hong kong  israel  italy  japan  south korea  north america and taiwan 
international revenues are denominated solely in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products are shipped to the customer  title has transferred and no significant obligations remain 
allowances are provided for estimated returns at the time of shipment 
in circumstances where we have not shipped the final version of our product  or when a customer has delayed its acceptance of our product  we defer recognition of the revenue associated with the given product at the time of shipment 
in addition  we defer technology development revenues when customers make advance payments and specified milestones under the technology development contract have not been met 
it usually takes more than one year for us to realize volume shipments of our products after we first contact a customer 
we first work with customers to achieve a design win  which may take six months or longer 
our customers then complete the design  testing and evaluation of their systems and begin the marketing process  a period which typically lasts an additional three to six months or longer 
as a result  a significant period of time may elapse between our sales efforts and our realization of revenues  if any  from volume purchases of our products by our customers 
our customers are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice 
we outsource the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our manufacturing partners 
costs of revenues also encompass our internal manufacturing and operations functions and a portion of our information systems and facilities costs 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  prototype costs related to the fabrication of our silicon chips  depreciation associated with software development tools  and amortization of deferred compensation 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
for example  we require a substantial number of prototypes to build and test our complex products and therefore incur significant prototype costs 
research and development is key to our future success 
the near term impact of our restructuring plan is expected to result in lower absolute dollar spending for research and development 
notwithstanding the anticipated impact on spending  based on past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense may increase in the long term as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our company 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales  customer service and applications engineering support functions  costs associated with promotional and other marketing expenses  as well as amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  the complexity of our products and the applications support necessary for successful interoperability and customer specific applications requires highly trained customer service and support personnel 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executives  finance  accounting  facilities  information services  human resources  recruiting expenses  legal and other professional fees  other corporate expenses  and amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include management s estimate of potential bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses may increase in the long term as we incur additional costs related to the growth of our business 
in connection with the grant of certain stock and other equity based compensation to our employees  technical advisors and directors  we have recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
deferred compensation is recorded upon grant and represents the difference between the grant price and the deemed fair value of our common stock options granted during these periods 
deferred compensation expense is being amortized using the graded vesting method  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 over the vesting period of each respective option  generally four years 
under the graded vesting method  each option grant is separated into portions based on its vesting terms  which results in acceleration of amortization expense for the overall award 
the accelerated amortization pattern results in expensing approximately of the total award in year one  in year two  in year three and in year four 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity 
as required by apb  we record an adjustment to equity based compensation when employees forfeit options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which were unvested on the date their employment terminated 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our equity based compensation programs 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  total net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles impairment of goodwill in process research and development total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net gain loss on long term investment benefit provision for income taxes net loss years ended december  and total net revenues total net revenues in were million  compared with million in  a decrease of 
the decrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in the average selling prices of our dsl products which was partially offset by a change in product mix and a increase in unit volume shipments 
our major customers for the years ended december  were nec and sumitomo who represented and of net revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   sumitomo and nec represented and of net revenues  respectively 
revenues from international customers  who were primarily located in japan  comprised of our net revenues in each of the years ended december  and cost of revenues cost of revenues  which reflects costs of product revenues  was million in and million in resulting in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower average selling prices per unit  partially offset by lower per unit product costs 
our gross margins in the future may be affected by competitive pricing strategies and the future introduction of certain lower margin items 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation and a decrease in software expense 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation  a decrease in customer evaluation board costs and a decrease in sales commissions  partially offset by increases in salary and severance costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  which was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million  a decrease in bad debt expense of  and decreases in expensed software and legal and stock administration fees  offset by increases in business insurance costs 
amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation  which is allocated among the above expense categories  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily related to the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life  as well as adjustments in related to forfeited options 
as required by apb  we record an an adjustment to equity based compensation related to employees who forfeit options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this was due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which required us to discontinue the amortization of goodwill effective january  in addition  in accordance with sfas we reclassified assembled workforce to goodwill  which eliminated the amortization of assembled workforce effective january impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test 
based upon this test  we recorded a charge of million to write down the value of goodwill associated with our purchase transactions 
no comparable charges were incurred in in process research and development expense in  we did not have any acquired in process research and development 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of acquired in process research and development ipr d related to our acquisition of vengines  inc the entire ipr d charge of million related to one project 
this project related to the development of high density voice processing semiconductor products  which bridge circuit switched voice and data networks 
the write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative future uses for the technology 
gain loss on long term investment we monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our long term equity investment and if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in value of this asset is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in june  in connection with the ongoing evaluation and review of our only long term equity investment  we recorded a non cash charge of  to write down the basis of this investment to zero as a result of this impairment 
in january  we sold this equity investment for  and reported this as a gain in the first quarter of interest income  net interest income  net was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio  and slightly lower average invested balances 
benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a tax benefit of  for the year ended december   which represents a refund of us federal income taxes  offset by foreign federal income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december   which represents federal and state minimum taxes as well as foreign income taxes 
as of december   we have million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and respectively 
the net operating losses and federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california net operating losses are not available to offset income until due to recent state law change 
utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before full utilization 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  includes approximately million related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be recorded in paid in capital when realized 
years ended december  and total net revenues total net revenues in were million  compared with million in  an increase of 
the growth in revenue was due to a higher volume of shipments  which increased  offset by a decrease in our average selling price and changes in product mix 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in revenues from cancellation fees 
cost of revenues cost of revenues  which reflects costs of product revenues  was million in and million in resulting in gross profit as a percentage of revenues of and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was attributable to improved yields and cost reductions at our suppliers  an increase in unit volume of shipments and a decrease in excess and obsolete inventory writedowns as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to additions in engineering personnel  increased usage of materials necessary to build prototypes  increases in depreciation resulting from the additional purchases of laboratory equipment and software development tools offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in were million  compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to the addition of personnel  an increase in marketing activity such as customer visits and attendance at trade shows offset by a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses in were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  which was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation of million  offset by increases in payroll and related costs  professional services  and business insurance expenditures 
during and  we charged  and  respectively  to bad debt expense based on our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
amortization of deferred compensation and non cash stock compensation amortization of deferred compensation  which is allocated among the above expense categories  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the use of the graded vesting method  which results in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards expected life 
in addition  expenses for and include charges of  and million  respectively  related to grants to consultants 
in process research and development expense in the first quarter of fiscal  we wrote off million of acquired in process research and development ipr d related to our acquisition of vengines  inc the entire ipr d charge of million related to one project 
this project related to the development of high density voice processing semiconductor products  which bridge circuit switched voice and data networks 
the write off was necessary because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and there were no alternative future uses for the technology 
at the time of the acquisition  the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology principally related to the completion of all planning  design  development and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product could be produced to meet its design specifications including features  function and performance 
at the acquisition date  we expected certain aspects of the acquired in process technology to be developed into commercially feasible products 
we estimated the fair value of the acquired in process technology based upon projected future revenues and cash flows related to the product that was expected to result from the in process project 
specific consideration was given to the percentage of completion of the in process project  which was estimated at 
the forecast cash flows were discounted back to a present value using a discount rate of 
at the acquisition date  we expected to incur additional costs of million to complete the in process project  which we expected to complete in june subsequent to the acquisition date  we discontinued development efforts on this specific project and intend to use certain aspects of this technology in future products 
gain loss on long term investment we monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our long term equity investment and if events and circumstances indicate that the decline in value of this asset is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value to estimated fair value 
in june  in connection with the ongoing evaluation and review of our only long term equity investment  we recorded a non cash charge of  to write down the basis of this investment to zero as a result of this impairment 
in january  we sold this non current equity investment for  and reported this as a gain in the first quarter of interest income  net interest income was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates obtained on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio  offset partially by an increase in average invested balances 
provision for income taxes we recorded a tax provision of  for the year ended december   which represents federal and state minimum taxes as well as foreign income taxes 
we recorded a provision for foreign income taxes of  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  operating activities during used million in cash 
this was primarily the result of the net loss of million being offset by the non cash impact of a million charge for the goodwill impairment  million in amortization of deferred compensation and million of depreciation and amortization expense 
the net loss was further offset by a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  and an increase in accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and related expenses of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and was primarily related to net sales of short term investments of million offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 
cash generated from financing activities was million for the year ended december   and was related to the net proceeds from employee stock plans of million 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
the rate at which we will consume cash will be dependent on the cash needs of future operations  which will  in turn  be directly affected by the levels of demand for our products 
significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments are shown in the table below in thousands payments due by period total year years ye ars over years operating leases facilities    capital leases software   operating leases software    inventory purchase commitments   total cash obligations    we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales  marketing  and product development programs  to establish additional facilities worldwide and to fund other general corporate activities 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with intellectual property and other rights and may become party to associated claims 
in certain cases  management has accrued estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters 
depending on the amount and timing of the resolutions of these claims  our future cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
if our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
the sale of equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements as of january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment at least annually 
in addition  within six months of adopting the new accounting standard  a transitional impairment test must be completed and any impairments identified must be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we completed our transitional impairment test during the quarter ended june  and no impairment was recognized 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review and  as a result of our assessment  we recorded an expense of million for the impairment of goodwill 
for further discussion  see notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and was effective january  sfas supersedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of segments of a business under accounting principles board opinion no 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in addition  sfas no 
establishes that fair value is the basis for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas is dependant on our activities subsequent to adoption 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements for our financial statements included in this form k 
we are currently evaluating the effects of fin  however we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement involves multiple deliverables and contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf will be effective for arrangements entered into after june  the company is evaluating the impact of its adoption on its consolidated results of operation and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions for this form k 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
recently passed legislation on july   president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act  portions of which immediately impact securities and exchange commission registrants  public accounting firms  lawyers and securities analysts 
this legislation is expected to have far reaching effects on the standards of integrity for corporate management  board of directors  and executive management 
additional disclosures  certifications and possibly procedures will be required of the company 
the company does not expect any material change in its practices as a result of the passage of this legislation  however  the full scope of the act has not yet been determined 
the act calls for additional regulations and requirements of publicly traded companies  many of which have yet to be issued 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this form k 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have not reported an operating profit for any year since our incorporation and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and will likely continue to fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in financial estimates of our revenues and operating results by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of integrated circuit companies  announcements by us  our competitors or others in related market segments of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  loss or decrease in sales to a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions  loss or reduction in manufacturing capacity from one or more of our key suppliers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of our common stock  inconsistent or low levels of trading volume of our common stock  commencement of or involvement in litigation  announcements by us or our competitors of key design wins and product introductions  a decrease in the average selling price of our products  ability to achieve cost reductions  and fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments 
a general economic slowdown  and a slowdown in spending in the telecommunications industry specifically  may negatively affect our business and operating results 
there have been announcements throughout the worldwide telecommunications industry of current and planned reductions in component inventory levels and equipment production volumes  and of delays in the build out of new infrastructure 
any of these trends  if continued  could result in lower than expected demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations generally  and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
a slowdown in deployment of dsl in japan would adversely affect our business and operating results 
sales to customers located in japan accounted for of net revenues for the year ended december  and of net revenues for the year ended december  any slowdown in the demand for our customers equipment in japan may cause our revenues to decline 
our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and major fluctuations in currency exchange rates could materially affect our japanese customers demand  thereby forcing them to reduce their orders  which could adversely affect our operating results 
competing dsl technologies have been deployed in japan  which may adversely impact the demand for our dsl products  market share and operating results 
we have worked in partnership with local telecommunications companies to develop the annex c standard for the dsl market in japan and have been able to achieve significant market share for dsl equipment purchases  based on our products  in japan 
in july  a certain service provider announced plans to deploy lower priced competing dsl technologies in japan and has subsequently deployed these competing technologies 
if these competing technologies continue to be successful  our market share in the dsl market in japan may decline and our business and operating results may be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from international sources  and difficulties associated with international operations could harm our business 
a substantial portion of our revenues have been derived from customers located outside of the united states 
in each of the years ended december  and  of our net revenues were to customers located in asia 
we may be unable to successfully overcome the difficulties associated with international operations 
these difficulties include staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in protecting intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  a limited ability to enforce agreements and other rights in some foreign countries  obtaining governmental approvals for products  and complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties 
because sales of our products are denominated exclusively in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
we depend on a few customers and if we lose any of them our sales and operations will suffer 
we sell our dsl products primarily to network equipment manufacturers 
our top two customers for the year ended december  were nec and sumitomo  accounting for and of our net revenues 
for the year ended december   sumitomo and nec accounted for and of our net revenues  respectively 
we do not have contractual volume commitments with these customers  but rather sell our products to them on an order by order basis 
we expect to be dependent upon a relatively small number of large customers in future periods  although the specific customers may vary from period to period 
if we are not successful in maintaining relationships with key customers and winning new customers  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our customers may demand preferential terms or delay our sales cycle  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our customers are in most cases larger than us and are able to exert a high degree of influence over us 
these customers may have sufficient bargaining power to demand low prices and other terms and conditions that may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  prior to selling our products to such customers  we must typically undergo lengthy product approval processes  often taking up to one year 
accordingly  we are continually submitting successive versions of our products as well as new products to our customers for approval 
the length of the approval process can vary and is affected by a number of factors  including customer priorities  customer budgets and regulatory issues affecting telecommunication service providers 
delays in the product approval process could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have been successful in the past in obtaining product approvals from our customers  such approvals and the ensuing sales of such products may not continue to occur 
delays can also be caused by late deliveries by other vendors  changes in implementation priorities and slower than anticipated growth in demand for the services that our products support 
a delay in  or cancellation of  the sale of our products could adversely affect our results from operations or cause them to significantly vary from quarter to quarter 
sales of our products depend on the widespread adoption of broadband access services  especially dsl 
if the demand for broadband access service does not increase  we may not be able to generate substantial sales 
sales of our products depend on the increased use and widespread adoption of broadband access services  and dsl services in particular  and the ability of telecommunications service providers to market and sell broadband access services 
our business would be harmed  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected  if the use of broadband access services does not increase as anticipated 
certain critical factors will likely continue to affect the development of the broadband access service market 
these factors include inconsistent quality and reliability of service  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  lack of interoperability among multiple vendors network equipment  congestion in service providers networks  inadequate security  and slow deployment of new broadband services over dsl lines 
because the sales cycle for our products typically lasts up to one year  and may be subject to delays  it is difficult to forecast sales for any given period 
if we fail to realize forecasted sales for a particular period  our stock price could decline significantly 
the sales cycle of our products is lengthy and typically involves a detailed initial technical evaluation of our products by our prospective customers  followed by the design  construction and testing of prototypes incorporating our products 
only after these steps are complete will we receive a purchase order from a customer for volume shipments 
this process generally takes from to months  and may last longer 
given this lengthy sales cycle  it is difficult to accurately predict when sales to a particular customer will occur 
in addition  we may experience unexpected delays in orders from customers  which may prevent us from realizing forecasted sales for a particular period 
our products are typically sold to equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products in the products that they in turn sell to consumers or to network service providers 
as a result  any delay by our customers  or by our customers customers  in the manufacture or distribution of their products will result in a delay in obtaining orders for our products 
rapid changes in the market for dsl chip sets may render our chip sets obsolete or unmarketable 
the market for chip sets for dsl products is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions by our competitors  changes in customer demands  and evolving industry standards 
any of these factors could make our products obsolete or unmarketable 
in addition  the life cycles of some of our products may depend upon the life cycles of the end products into which our products will be designed 
products with short life cycles require us to closely manage production and inventory levels 
unanticipated changes in the estimated total demand for our products and or the estimated life cycles of the end products into which our products are designed may result in obsolete or excess inventories  which in turn may adversely affect our operating results 
to compete  we must innovate and introduce new products 
if we fail to successfully introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis that meet customer requirements and are compatible with evolving industry standards  then our business  financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
because other broadband technologies may compete effectively with dsl services  our products may not capture market share 
dsl services are competing with a variety of different broadband data transmission technologies  including cable  satellite and other wireless technologies 
if any technology that is competing with dsl technology is more reliable  faster and less expensive or has other advantages over dsl technology  then the demand for our dsl products may decrease 
our markets are highly competitive and many of our competitors are established and have greater resources than we have 
the market for communications semiconductor and software solutions is intensely competitive 
given our stage of development  there is a substantial risk that we will not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing and support capabilities to compete successfully 
in addition  a number of other semiconductor companies have announced their intent to enter the market segments adjacent to or addressed by our products 
these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
we may also face competition from customers or prospective customers own internal development efforts 
any of these competitors may be able to introduce new technologies  respond more quickly to changing customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
because our products are components of other equipment  if broadband equipment manufacturers do not incorporate our products in their equipment  we may not be able to generate sales of our products in volume quantities 
our products are not sold directly to the end user  they are components of other products 
as a result  we rely upon equipment manufacturers to design our products into their equipment 
we further rely on the manufacturing and deployment of the equipment to be successful 
if equipment that incorporates our products is not accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve sales of our products in volume quantities  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
because manufacturers of communications equipment may be reluctant to change their sources of components  if we do not achieve design wins with such manufacturers  we may be unable to secure sales from these customers in the future 
once a manufacturer of communications equipment has designed a supplier s semiconductor into its products  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of semiconductors due to the significant costs associated with qualifying a new supplier 
accordingly  our failure to achieve design wins with equipment manufacturers  who have chosen a competitor s semiconductor could create barriers to future sales opportunities with these manufacturers 
third party claims regarding intellectual property matters could cause us to stop selling our products  pay monetary damages or obtain licenses on adverse terms 
there is a significant risk that third parties  including current and potential competitors  will claim that our products  or our customers products  infringe on their intellectual property rights 
the owners of these intellectual property rights may bring infringement claims against us or our customers 
any such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  would be costly and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
inquiries with respect to the coverage of our intellectual property could develop into litigation 
in the event of an adverse ruling for an intellectual property infringement claim  we could be required to obtain a license or pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products stopped by an injunction 
such a license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  if a customer of our products cannot acquire a required license on commercially reasonable terms  that customer may choose not to use our products 
we have obligations to indemnify our customers under some circumstances for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
if any intellectual property claims from third parties against one of our customers whom we have indemnified is held to be valid  the costs to us could be substantial and our business could be harmed 
we have received correspondence from certain parties  including texas instruments  alcatel and ricoh  requesting us to discuss the potential need for non exclusive licenses permitting us to utilize technology covered by various patents held by these parties 
we could be subject to claims similar to the texas instruments  alcatel and ricoh claims in the future 
depending on the amount and timing of any unfavorable resolutions of these claims  our future results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if we deliver products with defects  our credibility will be harmed  and the sales and market acceptance of our products will decrease 
our products are complex and have contained errors  defects and bugs when introduced and revised 
if we deliver products with errors  defects or bugs or products that have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be harmed  which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
further  if our products contain errors  defects and bugs  then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems and may have our sales to customers interrupted or delayed 
if any of these problems are not found until we have commenced commercial production  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product repair or replacement costs 
defects could also lead to potential liability as a result of product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers 
we have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in our products 
a successful product liability claim could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  and may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
we depend on sole source suppliers for several key components of our products 
we obtain certain parts  components and packaging used in the delivery of our products from sole sources of supply 
for example  historically  we have obtained digital semiconductor wafers from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd and we have obtained analog silicon wafers from united microelectronics corporation 
if we fail to obtain components in sufficient quantities when required or if we cannot adequately control manufacturing process quality  product yields or production costs  our business could be harmed 
developing and maintaining these strategic relationships with our vendors is critical for us to be successful 
any of our sole source suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price  or be subject to production disruptions from causes such as earthquakes 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in lower than expected manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
in order to remain competitive  we expect to continue to transition our products to increasingly smaller line width geometries 
this transition will require us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and redesign some products 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs  and we have designed some of our products to be manufactured in 
micron  
micron  
micron and 
micron geometry processes 
in the past  we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes  which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our foundry relationships 
if we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as smaller geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality  as well as customer and third party intellectual property  into our products 
however  we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis  or at all 
future consolidation in the telecommunications equipment industry may increase competition that could harm our business 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by increasing consolidation both within the telecommunications equipment sector and by companies combining or acquiring data communications assets and assets for delivering voice related services 
we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors 
we may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry 
increased competition and consolidation in our industry may require that we reduce the prices of our products or result in a loss of market share  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we are now  and may in the future be  dependent on certain strategic relationships with third parties in our industry  any additional consolidation involving these parties could reduce the demand for our products and otherwise harm our business prospects 
we may make future acquisitions and acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our business is highly competitive and  as such  our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we have addressed and may continue to address the need to develop new products is through acquisitions of other companies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the risk of diverting management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
we must also maintain our ability to manage such growth effectively 
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future 
we depend upon the continuing contributions of our key management  sales  customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of such personnel could seriously harm us 
in addition  we have not obtained key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key employees 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and the technologies used in our principal products  and if we do not enforce and protect our intellectual property  our business will be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these measures afford only limited protection 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect us 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in these countries 
there is a risk that our efforts to protect proprietary rights may not be adequate 
for example  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents or our other intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property or if the laws of a foreign jurisdiction do not effectively permit such protection  it would be easier for our competitors to sell competing products 
we may need to raise additional capital which might not be available or which  if available  could be on terms adverse to our common stockholders 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital for the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to ours 
further  if we issue equity securities  the ownership percentage of our stockholders would be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those existing holders of our common stock 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while concurrently maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the current value of the principal amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds  high quality commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and auction rate preferred securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
