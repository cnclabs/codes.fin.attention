the accounts receivable securitization facility contains a provision under which the agent can terminate the facility if the company s senior credit rating is downgraded below bb by s p or ba by moody s 
ferro does not believe that the termination of this facility would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity or the company s capital resource requirements 
the rating agencies may  at any time  based on various factors including changing market  political or socio economic conditions  reconsider the current rating of the company s outstanding debt 
based on rating agency disclosures  ferro understands that ratings changes within the general industrial sector are evaluated based on quantitative  qualitative and legal analyses 
factors considered by the rating agencies include industry characteristics  competitive position  management  financial policy  profitability  capital structure  cash flow production and financial flexibility 
s p and moody s have disclosed that the company s ability to improve earnings  reduce the company s level of indebtedness and strengthen cash flow protection measures  whether through asset sales  increased free cash flows from acquisitions or otherwise  will be factors in their ratings determinations going forward 
on may   the company completed the sale of five million common shares through a public offering

the company s credit facility contains customary operating covenants that limit its ability to engage in certain activities  including significant acquisitions 
see further information regarding these covenants in note to the company s consolidated financial statements under item herein 
the company s ability to meet these covenants in the future may be affected by events beyond its control  including prevailing economic  financial and market conditions and their effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company does have several options available to mitigate these circumstances  including selected asset sales and the issuance of additional capital 
in december  the company renegotiated these financial covenants to provide greater flexibility and strengthen the company s liquidity profile 
the company enters into precious metal leases primarily gold  silver  platinum and palladium which are consignment inventory arrangements under which banks provide the company with precious metals for a specified period for which the company pays a lease fee 
the lease terms are generally less than one year  and the company maintains sufficient quantities of precious metals to cover the lease obligations at all times 
the leases are treated as operating leases  and annual expenses were approximately million for as of december   the fair value of precious metals under leasing arrangements was million 
management believes it will continue to have sufficient availability under these leasing arrangements such that it will not be required to purchase or find alternative financing or sourcing arrangements for its precious metal inventory requirements 
however  factors beyond the control of the company  or those that management currently believes are unlikely  could result in non renewal of the leases  which could impact the liquidity of the company to the extent of the fair value of the precious metals leased 
ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flow 
in addition  a reduction in overall demand for the company s products could adversely affect cash flows from operations 
however  the company has a million revolving credit facility of which approximately million was available as of december  this liquidity  along with the liquidity from the company s asset securitization program and available cash flows from operations  should allow the company to meet its funding requirements and other commitments 
the company also has potential liquidity requirements related to payments under its leveraged lease program 
the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below dollars in thousands thereafter totals principal repayments of long term debt   revolving credit facility   obligations under non cancelable operating leases        off balance sheet obligations   includes million for the accounts receivable securitization facility and million for the leveraged lease program 
total pension expense  excluding supplemental plans  was million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to increased service and interest costs and lower than expected returns on plan assets 
contributions to the plans increased to million in from million in the unrecognized losses related to the plans were million at december   up from million at december  the weighted average discount rate was and the weighted average expected return on plan assets was as of december  pension expense for is expected to increase to million and pension contributions are expected to increase to million 
a increase in the actual return on plan assets would decrease the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
a decrease in the actual return on plan assets would increase the unrecognized plan losses at the end of the year by million 
the amount of any increase decrease in unrecognized plan losses would eventually be recognized in the company s pension expense in future years 
the company does not believe that the current funding status of the plan will cause significant business  liquidity or capital funding issues 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
statement no 
required entities to record the fair value of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  the entity either settles the obligation for the amount recorded or incurs a gain or loss

will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement no 
applies to costs from activities such as eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts  and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
for restructurings initiated after  a commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a one time charge for most of the anticipated costs 
instead  the company will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and it will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
the company does not anticipate statement no 
to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position

management is evaluating the impact of fin  and believes  as its asset defeasance program is currently structured  the adoption of interpretation will require the company to consolidate certain property  plant and equipment with a fair value of approximately million currently accounted for as an operating lease under that program  beginning july  see further information regarding the company s asset defeasance program in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item herein 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified the critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations

the company also expends funds for environmental remediations for both company owned and third party locations 
in accordance with statement no 
accounting for contingencies and statement of position environmental remediation liabilities  the company records a loss and establishes a reserve for litigation or remediation when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability exists and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve judgments made by management after considering a broad range of information including notifications  demand or settlements which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party  estimates performed by independent engineering companies and outside counsel  available facts  existing and proposed technology  the identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
however  the reserves may materially differ from ultimate actual liabilities if management s judgments are ultimately inaccurate 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where substantial pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amount of tax assets  liabilities and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations and expectations of future earnings 
however  the amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable if management s estimates are ultimately inaccurate 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuations of the company sponsored defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels  expected long term rates of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  lower levels of benefit credit or other additional expenses may be required  however  if actual results are more favorable than those projected by management  higher levels of benefit credit or lower levels of expense may result 
inventory allowances the company provides for valuation allowances of inventory based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory valuation allowances could be required  however  if market conditions are more favorable than those projected by management  established valuation allowances could prove to be unnecessary  and would be released into income 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon estimates of unrealizable amounts due from specific customers 
if the actual future cash collections are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances for doubtful accounts could be required  however  if actual future cash collections are more favorable than those projected by management  established allowances for doubtful accounts could prove to be unnecessary  and would be released into income

severance termination benefits were based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements and salary levels 
management estimated the charges based on these factors as well as projected final service dates 
if actual results differ from original estimates  the company will adjust the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet indebtedness in  the company initiated a million five year program to sell securitize  on an ongoing basis  a pool of its trade accounts receivable 
this program serves to accelerate cash collections of the company s trade accounts receivable at favorable financing costs 
under the program  certain of the receivables of the company are sold to a wholly owned unconsolidated special purpose entity  ferro finance corporation ffc 
ffc can sell  under certain conditions  an undivided fractional ownership interest in the pool of receivables to a multi seller receivables securitization company conduit 
additionally  under this program  receivables of certain european subsidiaries are sold directly to other conduits 
the company and certain european subsidiaries on behalf of ffc and the conduits provide service  administration and collection of the receivables 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to the company s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due  and in accordance with statement no 
 no liability is reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the company retains interests in the receivables transferred to ffc and conduits in the form of a note receivable to the extent that receivables transferred exceed advances 
the note receivable balance is included in other current assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company and certain european subsidiaries on a monthly basis measure the fair value of the retained interests at management s best estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash collections on the transferred receivables 
actual cash collections may differ from these estimates and would directly affect the fair value of the retained interests 
the company has a lease agreement for certain land  buildings  machinery and equipment for a five year period that expires in the company has the option to purchase the assets at the end of the lease term 
in the event the company chooses not to exercise this option  the company is obligated to pay  or is entitled to receive from the lessor  the difference between the net sales proceeds and the outstanding lease balance 
this lease is treated as an operating lease and as such is not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the company 
however  the company believes the provisions of the fasb s interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities may require the leased equipment and related obligations as the program is currently structured to be consolidated beginning in the third quarter of see further information above under impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
valuation of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and all long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable and annually for goodwill 
impairment tests are performed using fair values based upon forecasted cash flows  or  in the case of goodwill  using earnings multiples 
if actual cash flows or earnings multiples differ from projections  the company may have to record impairment charges 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risks is primarily limited to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuation risks 
ferro s exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to its debt portfolio including off balance sheet obligations under the accounts receivable securitization program 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs 
to limit interest rate risk on borrowings  the company maintains a portfolio of fixed and variable debt within defined parameters 
in managing the percentage of fixed versus variable rate debt  consideration is given to the interest rate environment and forecasted cash flows 
this policy limits exposure from rising interest rates and allows the company to benefit during periods of falling rates 
the company s interest rate exposure is generally limited to the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and amounts outstanding under its asset securitization program 
based on the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding at december  and  a change in interest rates would have resulted in a million and a million increase in expense  respectively 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt outstanding with an average interest rate of  all maturing after the fair market value of these debt securities was approximately million at december  ferro manages its currency risks principally through the purchase of put options and by entering into forward contracts 
put options are purchased to protect the value of euro denominated earnings against a depreciation of the euro versus the us dollar 
forward contracts are entered into to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transaction and other exposures 
at december   the company held forward contracts to manage its foreign currency transaction exposures which had a notional amount of million  and held other contracts of a non transactional nature which had a notional amount of million 
the company also held put options to sell euros for us dollars with a notional amount of million and an average strike price of euro 
at december  these forward contracts and options had an aggregate fair value of million 
a appreciation of the us dollar would have resulted in a million and million increase in the fair value of these contracts in the aggregate at december  and  respectively 
a depreciation of the us dollar would have resulted in a million and million decrease in the fair value of these contracts in the aggregate at december  and  respectively
