introduction in the course of the preparation of its financial statements for the fiscal year  the company identified accounting errors in estimating certain revenues and expenses in prior periods 
specifically  the company determined that estimates for certain access revenues and network expenses  as well as several settlement processes with other telephone companies  were incorrect 
the cumulative after tax effect of these errors resulted in the company recording additional net income of  during the periods from january  through september  these errors resulted in additions reductions to net income loss of   and  for the years ended december  and  and the nine months ended september   respectively 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company present restated retained earnings at january  to reflect a cumulative reduction in after tax net income of accounts receivable and accrued liabilities increased  and  at december   respectively  as a result of this restatement

overview we are a growing provider of telecommunications services to residential and business customers located primarily in north carolina 
we offer an integrated package of telecommunications services consisting of local and long distance telephone services  internet and data services  and digital wireless products and services 
we have worked to expand our core businesses through the development of integrated product and service offerings  investment in growth initiatives that exceed our return thresholds and targeted marketing efforts to efficiently identify and obtain customers 
in addition  we have made certain strategic investments that complement our business units 
during  we expanded our wireless business through the partitioning of our area of the cingular digital networks 
in march  the fcc approved the transfer of certain mmds and itfs spectrum from worldcom to wonc 
we devoted substantial effort in the past three years to developing business plans  enhancing our management team and board of directors  and designing and developing our business support and operating systems 
development of these areas has required significant investment of capital and start up expenses 
we believe that through these investments  we are positioning ourselves to achieve our strategic objectives 
our primary focus is to maximize our ilec business in our current markets by cross selling integrated products and packages and growing our customer base through our clec  greenfield  internet and data services  and digital wireless businesses 
we will also consider strategic acquisitions and investments as opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies and estimates ct communications discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continuously evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  restructuring charges  long lived assets  investments  income taxes  pensions and post retirement benefits  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements included herein describes our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when services are provided regardless of the period in which they are billed 
revenues from sales of telephone equipment are recognized upon delivery to the customer for direct sale leases while revenues from sales type leases are recognized upon delivery to the customer in an amount equal to the present value of the minimum rental payments under the fixed non cancelable lease term 
the deferred finance charges applicable to these leases are recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the cost of wireless handsets generally exceeds the sales price 
costs in excess of revenues for handset sales are recognized upon delivery of equipment to the customer 
revenues are deferred and the related cost of sales equal to revenues are capitalized and amortized over the average life of customer service contracts 
installation fees are deferred and the related costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated life of the customer in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  issued by the sec in december restructuring charges we periodically record charges resulting from restructuring operations  including consolidations and or relocations of operations  changes in our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs  or other environmental factors 
the company announced its intent to discontinue its wireless broadband trial and recognized a loss of approximately million in to write down the related carrying amounts of assets to their fair values less cost to sell and recorded related liabilities for estimated severance costs  lease termination costs  and other exit costs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management s judgment and may include costs related to employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments of excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of the facilities charge  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
these estimates will be reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on known real estate market conditions and the credit worthiness of subtenants  resulting in revisions to established facility reserves 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment in computing depreciation expense 
consideration is given to technological advances and utilization of our existing facilities 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  changes in technology  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if an impairment review is triggered  we measure any impairment based on projected cash flows 
our net goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we will no longer amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial review of our goodwill in and will perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
no impairment charge was required during investments we hold certain investments and investment securities that we evaluate to determine whether unrealized losses are other than temporary 
we perform this evaluation quarterly by comparing market price of the investments and securities to the current recorded value 
based on this evaluation and consideration of other factors  we determine the classification of unrealized losses and record charges to adjust the carrying value of these investments 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax liabilities at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million and million at december  and  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefits the decline in equity markets in recent years coupled with record low interest rates have negatively impacted companies with defined benefit pension plans 
these factors have decreased plan assets that are available to pay plan benefits at the same time the cost of providing benefits has increased 
we used a discount rate of in valuing our december  pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
in addition  we have assumed a long term expected return on assets 
the pension benefit obligation increased to approximately million with plan assets valued at million  however  considering the underlying estimates embedded in the determination of accrual benefit obligations  the plan is adequately funded 
this compares with a benefit obligation of million at december   with plan assets valued at million 
although difficult to predict because of the relation to market performance  we do not anticipate any cash funding needs to meet minimum required funding thresholds in the post retirement benefit obligation at december  was million and is not funded by the company 
the company has adopted sfas no 
employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  and is amortizing the estimated transition liability over years 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgment is required in assessing the collectability of customer accounts and other receivables 
we accordingly maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations  guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have  or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
results of operations we have identified reportable segments based on the common characteristics of products and services and or the customers served 
the identified reportable segments are ilec  clec  greenfield  digital wireless  and internet and data services ids 
all other businesses that do not meet reporting guidelines and thresholds are reported under other business units 
prior to january  the clec and greenfield business units were treated as a single reportable segment and their results were combined for reporting purposes 
subsequent to that date we determined these business units should be reported as individual reportable segments based on report thresholds 
the following discussion reviews the results of our consolidated operations and specific results within each reportable segment 
consolidated operating results in thousands except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income capital expenditures total assets ending wired access lines operating revenue increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to this increase in operating revenue is related primarily to two main factors a full year of digital wireless services after the partitioning of our wireless territory from cingular in june as compared to months in and the continued significant growth of our customer base in our clec and greenfield businesses 
similarly the increase in operating revenue from to was related to the wireless partitioning event and significant customer growth in our clec  greenfield  digital wireless and internet businesses 
see the following discussions by business unit for more detail 
as a result of this growth in our competitive businesses we have diversified operating revenues in our company significantly over the past two years 
in  of revenue was related to our ilec business while our digital wireless  clec greenfield and internet businesses represented only between and each 
in  just two years later  the ilec represented of revenue while digital wireless had grown to of revenues and the combined clec and greenfield businesses had grown to of revenues 
in  operating expense increased million or as compared to depreciation and amortization costs accounted for million of this increase due to several years of increased capital expenditures which included projects such as the partitioning of our wireless territory from cingular and the building of our new corporate headquarters facility 
the remaining million of the increase is related to the operation of our partitioned wireless business for a full year and the costs associated with the greater customer numbers in our clec and greenfield businesses  partially offset by internal efficiencies and cost control efforts 
from to  operating expense increased million or as we invested heavily in our new growth businesses and partitioned our wireless area 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million from to as we completed our wireless partitioning  accelerated our greenfield project signings and invested in the growth of our competitive businesses 
similarly  other operating expense grew in as a result of the increased customer base of our competitive businesses  the expansion of our clec into the greensboro market and the mid year wireless partitioning event  which added over  new post pay wireless customers 
as a result of the revenue growth and expense growth  operating margins improved to in after having fallen to in  from in  as a result of the investment in our newer competitive businesses 
ilec in thousands except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income capital expenditures total assets ending business access lines ending residential access lines ending total access lines ending long distance lines   n a operating revenue for the ilec declined from million in to million in this decrease in revenue was mainly due to a corresponding decrease in access lines 
we attribute much of the line loss to the nearly penetration of our access line base with our dsl internet product causing some of our access line customers to cancel second lines previously used for dial up internet service 
it is also believed that similar pressure on second lines is occurring from cable modem internet service offered in our incumbent area by time warner and from wireless carriers 
the penetration of our incumbent base by our dsl product more than doubled in operating revenue and access lines were essentially flat from to operating expense in the ilec declined at a slightly faster rate than operating revenues in boosting operating margin from in to in contributing to this margin increase was a million reduction in expenses related to operational efficiencies offset by a million increase in depreciation and amortization costs related to capital spending on several significant projects in recent years 
an example of our focus on internal operating efficiencies is the decision  announced in the fourth quarter  to outsource operator services to a reliable industry specialist  a move that we estimate will save us over  per year beginning in capital expenditures in were of ilec operating revenues  showing the increased focus on cost discipline we have placed in this area 
ilec capital expenditures in and were of revenues and of revenues  respectively 
ilec access lines subscribing to our long distance service increased in despite the access line loss 
at the end of over of ilec access lines subscribed to our long distance service  up from at year end while long distance minutes of use per landline customer have seen substantial declines in recent years across the industry due to wireless substitution  margins have shown stability in recent quarters and this product continues to provide us with a significant flow of cash 
clec in thousands except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines   n a clec operating revenue was million in  representing a million or increase over this increase is due to a increase in access lines during as well as a increase in clec long distance customers 
clec continued its steady growth within the charlotte and greensboro  north carolina markets becoming a significant carrier in most of the area served 
greenfield operations were included within the clec s financial results in clec operating expense was million in compared with million during after growing by from to as our clec expanded into the greensboro market  our operating expense increased in  significantly smaller than the revenue growth 
we expect margins to continue to be positively impacted as we leverage existing transport infrastructure with new customers 
operating expense increases in were principally related to the increase in our customer base  which impacted customer service  billing  transport and network costs 
we did not enter any new markets in  electing instead to focus on market penetration in our current markets and leverage existing transport infrastructure where possible 
our clec focuses on the metropolitan areas and communities immediately surrounding our ilec territory 
greenfield in thousands except lines restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss capital expenditures total assets ending access lines ending long distance lines total signed agreements prior to  our greenfield business financial results were reported as part of the clec business 
greenfield revenue more than doubled in to million compared to million for this revenue increase is primarily attributable to a doubling in access lines in related to the continued  but slower than expected  filling of developments covered by signed preferred provider agreements 
included in this access line increase was the opening of the triangle town center mall in raleigh  the third destination mall served by our greenfield business 
our greenfield business signed preferred provider agreements in  bringing the total number of signed agreements to these agreements represent an estimated  access lines once these developments have been completely built out 
the expected residential business line mix of these projects is expected to be residential and business 
operating expense increased in to million  related to the increase in access lines and a million increase in depreciation expense associated with the up front capital expenditures required in most of the developments 
most of the increase in expense in related to the increasing customer base 
capital expenditures in were essentially flat with levels as projects representing  to  potential access lines were started each year 
at the end of  of greenfield access lines also subscribed to our long distance service  up from in this increase is mainly due to the fact that many of the early greenfield access lines were business lines located in mall projects 
business customers in malls historically do not elect our long distance service as frequently as residential customers since many retail businesses have national long distance contracts 
as the residential percentage of greenfield access lines increases we have seen our long distance penetration rates increase 
digital wireless in thousands except subscribers restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss capital expenditures total assets ending post pay subscribers our digital wireless business saw operating revenue grow in as it completed its first full year after partitioning our portion of the cingular wireless digital network in the summer of in  as part of the partitioning  the company acquired over  post pay subscribers and ended with over  post pay subscribers 
we continued our post pay wireless subscriber growth in by adding over  net subscribers  an increase of 
also contributing to our increase in revenue during was increased settlement revenue related to a increase in the minutes of use on our wireless network from the end of to the end of contributing to this increase was the addition of wireless cell sites in  as we improved the coverage in our service territory 
operating expense increased in to million 
the addition of customers  the increase in minutes on our network  the opening of two new retail outlets and the signing of new indirect distributor agreements contributed to the increase in operating expense over capital expenditures were million in  primarily related to the addition of new cell sites in our territory and the addition of capacity on selected other cell sites 
these projects were largely one time projects related to the filling out of our service territory after the partitioning event 
internet and data services in thousands except lines restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss capital expenditures total assets ending dsl lines ending dial up accounts ending high speed accounts ids operating revenue grew in to million 
during  we significantly decreased our web development activities and continued to convert many dial up internet customers to our dsl service 
the resulting decrease in web development and dial up revenues in was more than offset by increases in dsl and high speed revenues 
operating revenue in increased as we acquired a local internet service company  webserve  in december of  and continued to expand our dsl coverage area and sales efforts 
ids operating expense was million in  a decrease compared to this decrease relates to the reduction in our web development services  the increased focus on product margins  somewhat offset by costs associated with an increasing dsl customer base 
the million or increase in expense in over was related to the addition of webserve and the growth of our dsl and other product sales efforts 
dsl customers more than doubled in each of the last two years bringing total dsl lines in service to  at december  this represents a penetration rate of of combined greenfield and ilec access lines 
other business units in thousands restated restated total operating revenue total operating expense depreciation and amortization operating income loss capital expenditures total assets operating revenue in was attributable to service provided to maxcom 
no such services were provided in or operating expense for the other units increased million in to million 
this million increase was related primarily to a million increase in depreciation and amortization due to the completion of our corporate headquarters and million related to the inclusion of wonc in our consolidated results after our purchase of majority ownership in the spring of capital expenditures include the building of our new corporate center  information systems and software  property and other corporate capital expenditures 
the increase in total assets from to of million relates primarily to the consolidation of wonc 
other income other income expense increased million in when compared to the year ended december  this increase relates to a decrease of million in investment impairments offset in part by a million reduction in gains on sales of investments and a million increase in interest expense 
we completed the majority of our planned public equity investment sales by early  and the gain on sales of investments decreased significantly in the second half of this resulted in a million decrease in gain on sale of investments in versus in the fourth quarter of we recognized a million pre tax loss due to the write down of maxcom bringing total investment impairment charges to million in in  this number dropped dramatically as we experienced only million in total investment impairment charges  related to several marketable securities and other investments 
our debt has increased over the past several years due primarily to the investments we have made in our growth businesses 
as a result  interest expense has also increased 
in  other expenses  principally interest  were million  a million increase over liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   and increased million during the increase in was primarily driven by positive working capital changes and greater cash generated from operations attributable to improved margins 
the increase in related primarily to the increase in cash provided from the wireless operations that were acquired from bellsouth  partially offset by a decrease in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased million in from million invested in net capital additions declined million due primarily to the completion of the company s corporate headquarters center in employees were consolidated from several leased locations into the newly completed corporate headquarters center 
in addition  cash used for acquisitions decreased million in compared to when we completed the purchase of certain wireless spectrum from the cingular dcs partnership 
these reductions in investing activities were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales of investments due to unfavorable market conditions 
net cash provided by financing activities we significantly reduced our reliance on cash provided by financing activities in proceeds net of repayments from credit facilities declined to million in compared to million in and million in we have an unsecured revolving credit facility with cobank  acb cobank for million  of which million was outstanding on december  the interest rate on the credit facility is variable based on libor plus a spread based on financial ratios including debt to operating earnings less depreciation and amortization 
the libor interest rate on december   was approximately and the applicable spread was 
the credit facility provides for quarterly payments of interest until maturity in april we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to fix million of the outstanding principal at rates of  and plus a spread  currently 
in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility with first charter bank that bears interest at the day libor plus 
as of december   we have no amounts outstanding under the first charter bank credit facility 
we also have a million senior unsecured year term loan with cobank 
the term loan requires quarterly payments of interest at a fixed rate of until maturity on december  anticipated sources and uses of funds cash flows from ilec operations provide our primary source of funding for existing operations  capital expenditures  investment opportunities  dividends and debt repayment 
we have available million under our cobank credit facility  million under our first charter revolving line of credit  and assets including our corporate office facility or investment securities that can be monetized 
we believe our existing sources of liquidity  cash provided by operations  new or existing credit facilities and the sale of investment securities will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
our capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million  as follows ilec network facilities and plant clec network expansion greenfield projects internet infrastructure wireless coverage and capacity cell sites other other uses of cash in may include investments in unconsolidated companies and marketable securities 
we expect to fund these outlays through cash from operations and sales of investment securities

the interest rate was approximately with the spread on december  we have entered into three interest rate swap transactions to establish a fixed rate of interest on million of the outstanding principal as of december  the interest rate swaps will protect us  to the extent of million of outstanding principal amount  against an upward movement in interest rates  but subjects us to above market interest costs if interest rates decline
