overview of our business ribozyme pharmaceuticals  inc is a leader in the field of nucleic acid technology 
we are using our proprietary technology and our expertise in molecular engineering to develop a new class of nucleic acid based therapeutics based on rna interference rnai 
we plan to continue as a manufacturer of oligonucleotides chains of nucleotides that can be chemically synthesized in specific sequences for our use and for use by our collaborators and customers to generate revenue for the purpose of supporting our therapeutic discovery operations 
since inception in  we have dedicated ourselves to engineering rna based molecules 
until recently  we focused on developing ribozyme based therapeutics and diagnostics 
as a result  we advanced three product candidates into clinical development 
we continue to have a joint development program with chiron corporation chiron for one of these products  angiozyme 
we own  or have exclusive licenses to use  over issued or allowed patents relating to nucleic acid technology 
our expertise in nucleic acid technology enables us to now focus on the development of a new type of nucleic acid based therapeutic based on rna interference 
we have redirected our research to rnai because we believe it will have the best prospects for commercial success 
we are using our expertise to design  stabilize  manufacture and deliver small interfering nucleic acids sinas that facilitate the process of rnai 
we believe sina based drugs will become important therapeutics in the future 
we are developing drugs that address significant and unmet medical needs 
we have been in research and or clinical development for the following product candidates angiozyme angiozyme is a ribozyme based product we are developing in collaboration with chiron to treat solid tumor cancers 
we have completed our preliminary analysis of week data and will be presenting the results at the asco meeting in chicago in may hepatitis c virus hcv we are developing chemically stabilized sinas that target the hcv viral rna to treat hcv infection 
this program is in the lead identification phase of development 
macular degeneration we are developing chemically stabilized sinas that target the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf pathway to treat macular degeneration 
this program is in the lead identification phase of development 
we are also developing herzyme in collaboration with elan corporation plc and its affiliates elan to treat breast and other solid tumor cancers 
a phase i clinical trial has been completed and we are currently analyzing the data 
elan has publicly indicated that they do not expect to continue development of oncology drugs 
we do not intend to pursue independent development of herzyme 
our business strategy is to use our patented technology and molecular engineering expertise to create value by developing stabilized sina molecules for therapeutic applications in several disease areas  leveraging our nucleic acid expertise through licensing  process development and pilot manufacturing  maintaining and expanding our patent portfolio and proprietary technology  spinning off or selling our diagnostic technology  and  entering into partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development of rnai based therapeutics 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
to date  we have committed substantially all our resources to our research and product development programs 
we have not generated any revenues from therapeutic product sales  nor do we anticipate generating any therapeutic product revenues in the foreseeable future 
revenue recorded from our collaborative agreements consists of up front revenue 
up front non refundable fees are recognized upon signing an agreement when it represents the culmination of a separate earnings process 
all other up front fees are deferred and recognized systematically over the period the fees are earned 
research revenue 
typically  research revenue is based on the fully burdened cost of a researcher working on a collaboration 
rates are billed per employee for time worked on a project 
this revenue is typically invoiced on a monthly basis  either up front or in arrears 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period as services are performed  with the balance reflected as deferred revenue until earned 
the revenue is typically recurring over the term of a collaboration 
license revenue 
license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license 
payments received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
milestone revenue 
milestone revenue is recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved 
milestone revenue is typically not consistent or recurring in nature 
our revenue has consisted primarily of research revenue payments from our collaborators 
all revenues are either deferred as a liability or recognized upon satisfying revenue criteria 
as of december   all revenues that have been recognized are earned  and no further obligation exists for recognized revenue 
we depend upon funding from external financing and corporate collaborations for our research and product development programs and expect to depend upon this funding for the foreseeable future 
we have not been profitable since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  losses have resulted primarily from expenses associated with our research and development programs 
we expect to incur additional losses as our current and potential product candidates advance through development and commercialization 
in addition  future milestone payments under some of our collaborations are contingent upon our meeting particular research or development goals 
the amount and timing of future milestone payments are contingent upon the terms of each collaboration agreement 
in some instances  we may forfeit milestone payments if we fail to accomplish a predetermined goal within a certain time frame 
therefore  we are subject to significant variation in the timing and amount of our revenues and results of operations from period to period 
our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we have not been exposed to foreign currency translation risks and have not engaged in any hedging 
deferred patent costs 
we capitalize legal costs directly incurred in pursuing patent applications as deferred patent costs 
when such applications result in an issued patent  the related costs are amortized over the remaining legal life of the patents  which is assumed to be years  using the straight line method 
on a quarterly basis  we review our issued patents and pending patent applications and if we determine to abandon a patent application  or an issued patent no longer has economic value  the unamortized balance in deferred patent costs relating to that patent is immediately expensed 
it is possible the estimates of future economic life of our commercialization revenues  the amount of anticipated future commercialization revenues  or both  will be reduced significantly in the near term due to alternative technologies developed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
as a result  the carrying amount of deferred patent costs may be reduced in the future 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliates 
in january  we formed a joint venture with elan for the development and commercialization of herzyme 
as part of the joint venture  we licensed herzyme and elan licensed its medipad drug delivery technology to the joint venture  medizyme pharmaceuticals  ltd 
while we own of the outstanding common stock of medizyme  elan has retained significant minority investor rights that are considered participating rights as defined in eitf investors accounting for an investee when the investor owns a majority of the voting stock but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights 
therefore  we do not consolidate the operations of medizyme  but instead account for our investment in medizyme under the equity method 
as of december  we had absorbed our entire cost basis in our equity investment through our share of medizyme s net losses  however  we are committed to fund future losses incurred by medizyme and therefore may continue to invest in medizyme and recognize our portion of ongoing losses 
in  we invested million and transferred our gene identification and target validation technology to atugen ag  a german privately owned biotechnology company 
upon formation in  we owned a majority of common stock outstanding in atugen  however  similar to the above discussion on medizyme about participating rights  minority investors of atugen retained significant investor rights and therefore we did not consolidate operations but instead accounted for our investment in atugen under the equity method 
in  we had absorbed our entire cost basis in our equity investment through our share of atugen s net losses 
we currently own of atugen and will record our share of any future profits 
redeemable preferred stock 
our balance sheets as of december  and present our series a preferred stock and related accreted preferred stock dividends outside of permanent stockholders equity  as a result of the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  classification of and measurement of redeemable securities 
we issued the series a preferred stock in january in connection with the formation of our joint venture  medizyme pharmaceuticals  ltd 
medizyme  with elan corporation  plc 
shares of the series a preferred stock issued to elan are exchangeable for a portion of our investment in medizyme 
the right of elan to exchange the series a preferred stock is applicable for the period october through may if the exchange feature expires unexercised  the series a preferred stock and accreted dividends will be reclassified to permanent equity 
we have agreed with elan that upon consummation of our proposed investor financing  all of their shares of series a preferred stock will be converted into shares of our common stock 
results of operations for twelve months ended december   and revenues generally  revenue fluctuations result from changes in the number and activity level of funded research projects as well as the timing and completion of contract milestones 
our revenues are split into three categories collaborative agreements  collaborative agreements joint venture  and collaborative agreements related parties 
collaborative agreement revenues primarily includes revenues recorded from our arrangements with chiron  fujirebio and geron 
chiron revenues are related to our collaboration on angiozyme 
collaborative agreements joint venture includes revenues from medizyme 
collaborative agreements related parties includes revenues recorded from atugen 
collectively  collaborative revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the corresponding period in this decrease is due primarily to lower research revenues associated with medizyme  our joint venture for the development of herzyme with elan  and with angiozyme  our collaboration with chiron 
as herzyme and angiozyme move forward in clinical trials  less time is required of our researchers and more third party expenses are incurred 
reimbursements from our collaborators for third party expenses are credited against expenses and not recognized as revenue 
medizyme revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in in addition  chiron revenues decreased to million in compared to million in our revenues from atugen have decreased by approximately  because atugen usa ceased operations during however  revenue from other sources and projects increased for the same period 
during the first quarter of  we signed an agreement with fujirebio  a japanese diagnostic company  for the use of allosteric ribozymes that resulted in revenues of  for the twelve months ended december  in addition  for the twelve months ended december   we recognized  from geron for our process development and manufacturing scale up for geron s anti cancer drug  grn collaborative revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in compared to was primarily due to million recorded from lilly in for the hepatitis c collaboration which terminated in the lilly revenues included million in milestone payments and million in research revenues 
in addition  revenues recorded from chiron decreased million during from the year ended december  the decrease was due to the progression of angiozyme in clinical trials and as angiozyme progressed  it required fewer researchers working on the project which  in turn  resulted in lower research revenues 
also  because of the progression of herzyme in clinical trials  and therefore fewer researchers working on the project  revenues from medizyme decreased in compared to by million 
however  while revenues decreased in compared to  reimbursements that offset manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with chiron increased 
reimbursements from our collaborators for outside expenses are recorded as credits against expenses 
for the year ended december   reimbursements from chiron were million compared to million for the corresponding period in approximately million of the reimbursement in was related to third party contract manufacturing costs of angiozyme 
we expect our research revenues related to angiozyme and herzyme to decrease because of a reduction in activities 
however  we will be actively pursuing partnerships and collaborations to fund our other research and development programs 
expenses research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in of million was primarily due to million of expenses  net of partner reimbursements  we incurred in for third party manufacturing costs for angiozyme and our hcv drug to support our clinical trials  compared to million  net  we incurred in the third party manufacturing costs incurred in  as well as an increase in clinical trial activities  were also reasons that research and development expenses increased million from the prior year ended december  clinical and preclinical trial expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in over the next year  we expect certain research and development expenses  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing expenses  to decrease as we complete current phases of clinical development programs for angiozyme and herzyme 
however  as we move forward in our rnai research and preclinical development  we expect expenses related to such research and development to increase 
our research and development expenses currently include costs of scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  patent filing  depreciation  utilities  administrative expenses and an allocation of corporate costs 
we cannot predict the scope or magnitude of future research and development expenses at this time for our product candidates in the early phases of research and development as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirement and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step typically is more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore results  generally  in increasing expenditures 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
we have incurred the following expenses  net of partner reimbursements  related to our three major research and development projects in thousands december  angiozyme hcv herzyme total research and development project costs include costs of salaries  benefits  clinical trial site costs  outside services  materials and supplies incurred to support the clinical programs 
indirect costs allocated to projects include facility and occupancy costs  intellectual property related expenses  including patent prosecution and maintenance  and license and royalty payments 
for purposes of project tracking  we capture the level of effort expended on a project through our project management system  which is based primarily on human resource time allocated to each project  supplemented by an allocation of indirect costs and other specifically identifiable costs  if any 
as a result  the costs we allocate to a project are not intended to  and do not necessarily  reflect the precise actual incremental costs of the project 
future costs related to the projects are difficult to estimate due to the nature of the technology and the inability to foresee outcomes of key milestones in the clinical development of each drug 
however  generally speaking in the biotechnology industry  drug timelines track certain averages such as the following preclinical research may last years depending on the technology 
in the case of ribozymes  which were an entirely new technology  the research phase for the first generation ribozyme drug lasted approximately six years and cost more than million starting with the formation of the company in until our first chemically synthesized ribozyme ind was filed in preclinical research included development from a conceptual ribozyme to the first chemically synthesized ribozymes  through the completion of animal toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies necessary to file the angiozyme ind  our first chemically synthesized drug introduced in the clinic 
phase i clinical trials are conducted with small groups of healthy volunteers to determine the drug s safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
phase i trials may last anywhere from a few months to two years and may cost several million dollars depending on the drug and indication targeted 
phase ii clinical trials are generally expanded safety  optimal dosing and efficacy studies in small groups of patients afflicted with the targeted disease 
phase ii trials can last up to several years and can cost several million dollars 
variances in cost and time between trials maybe due to the trial regimen  number of patients and length of time patients are on trial 
phase iii clinical trials  are large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with the target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the drug 
a phase iii trial may last anywhere from a year to several years and would cost many millions of dollars 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
if phase iii trials are successful  the final step in a drug approval timeline is submission of a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration 
the nda process may last several years 
the above timelines and costs are estimates and generalizations and as such involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from estimates 
in addition  we intend to seek collaborations and corporate partners to assist in the cost and complexities of developing our drugs 
if we are successful in our drug development  we intend to rely on our corporate partners or third parties with established direct sales forces to market  distribute and sell our products 
these partners or third parties may have significant control over important aspects of the commercialization of our products  including market identification  marketing methods  pricing  sales force recruitment and management and promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases from year to year are the result of increased staffing and expenses necessary to manage and support our expanding product and business development efforts 
general and administrative expenses may continue to increase as a result of increasing legal and other professional fees in connection with business development efforts and patent protection 
staffing levels for research  development and general administrative departments have fluctuated from a high of during to a low of as of march we increased staffing significantly during and in order to support the clinical development of angiozyme and our hcv drug 
during  we discontinued our hcv clinical trials due to a toxicity issue  scaled back considerably the scope and number of angiozyme trials and have redirected our efforts into the research and development of rnai therapeutics 
our expenses in  and reflect the staffing fluctuation 
we anticipate remaining at our current staffing levels through and do not currently expect to increase staffing significantly in the next few years 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease from year to year is primarily due to declining average balances in our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
interest income generally fluctuates as a result of the average amount of cash available for investment and prevailing interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during interest expense was primarily related to our elan convertible note 
in  we increased our borrowings on the elan convertible note and therefore interest expense increased as well 
in june  elan converted our convertible note to preferred stock 
the note accrued interest at a semi annual rate through june  but as of july the preferred stock accrued dividends at a semi annual rate 
offsetting the decrease in accrued interest related to the elan note during  was interest expense related to additional borrowings funding capital equipment purchases through long term debt established with a credit facility in december interest expense is expected to increase in the future as we arrange for additional financing for operations 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate 
equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate was million for the period ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the expense is our share of medizyme s expenses  limited to the cost of our investment 
the decreases in the losses recognized over the years are due to the decreases in medizyme s expenses related to the development of herzyme 
the decreases are the result of the transition of herzyme from research to clinical trials 
medizyme s expenses include million amortized expense for a million license fee paid to elan in january  as well as million we invoiced medizyme in for research we conducted and clinical trial expenses we incurred with herzyme 
medizyme s expenses also include the million in amortized license expense  as well as million we invoiced in for research we conducted and clinical trial expenses we incurred with herzyme 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through sales of equity securities in public offerings  private placements of preferred and common stock  funds received under our collaborative agreements and financing under equipment and tenant improvement loans 
from inception through december   we have received approximately million in net proceeds from private placements  million in net proceeds from public offerings  million from our collaborations  and million from equipment financing 
we had cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million at december  compared with million at december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale is primarily the result of million used for operations  net of revenues of million  million used for investments in equipment  leasehold improvements  patents and additional investment in an unconsolidated affiliate  net  in loans to executives   received in proceeds from equity transactions  million received in proceeds from credit facilities  and million paid for debt obligations 
loans totaling  were made to five members of senior management prior to the passage of the sarbanes oxley act in july we invest our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
accounts receivable at december  were  compared to million at december  accounts receivable at december  included  due from medizyme for research support for herzyme and  due from chiron for reimbursement of angiozyme expenses  as well as  due from miscellaneous other sources 
total additions for property  plant and equipment for the year ended december  were million 
as of december   we had borrowed million on a million loan facility through a credit institution 
the loan facility through the credit institution currently averages an interest rate of  and matures in or months depending on the type of equipment collateralized 
additional borrowings through the loan facility are currently on hold pending an improvement in our cash position 
we anticipate future property  plant and equipment needs to be financed through the existing loan facility and additional credit facilities yet to be determined 
in the fourth quarter of we purchased on credit million of drug from a contract manufacturer 
the terms of payment for the purchase were million paid on october   million to be paid on or before october   and  to be paid on or before june  the future payments will accrue interest at the rate of compounded annually  calculated from january  until payment 
the following table summarizes our debt obligations as of december  payments due by period thereafter total long term debt operating leases total debt obligations chiron 
in july  we entered into an agreement with chiron to collaborate exclusively on up to five specific targets selected by chiron 
angiozyme is being developed in collaboration with chiron and we share equally all development costs and future profits with chiron 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to chiron in exchange for reacquiring all rights to develop any product containing or utilizing an hiv target 
we recorded an expense of  in march in connection with the issuance of the stock 
for the year ended december  we recorded million and  in revenues and reimbursement of expenses  respectively  from chiron for costs incurred for the clinical development of angiozyme 
schering ag 
in april  we entered into a purchase agreement  subsequently amended  with schering ag and schering berlin venture corporation  or sbvc  an affiliate of schering ag  as part of our target discovery and validation program 
sbvc made a million equity investment in us in april in exchange for  shares of our common stock and in april made an additional equity investment of million in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
separately  schering ag provided loans of million in each of    and we received our final draw down of million from schering ag in april the loans  which carry an interest rate of per annum  are immediately convertible into equity at schering ag s option 
additionally  of any borrowings we make on the line of credit must be collateralized by equipment purchases 
in april  after the completion of our public offering  we repaid million of our outstanding borrowings to schering ag 
in june  schering ag converted  of the loan balance into  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of 
at december   the outstanding borrowings and accrued interest of million were convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
principal and interest payments are deferred until maturity of the loans in april as a result of the atugen formation in  we now subcontract all of our existing target discovery and validation programs to atugen  which does not affect the terms of our loan agreement with schering ag 
the agreement expired in april in connection with our proposed new financing schering ag has agreed to restructure our debt obligations as we describe below 
elan 
in january  we completed a joint venture with elan to develop and commercialize of herzyme  our potential product to treat breast and other cancers 
in accordance with the collaboration  we sold to elan our series a exchangeable convertible preferred stock for million and  in turn  used those funds for initial funding of medizyme 
as of december  the series a preferred stock and accrued stock dividends were convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
also  as part of the collaboration  elan purchased  shares of our common stock for a purchase price of million 
in addition  elan purchased  shares of common stock for million in may  which was at a premium to the market price 
in january  we estimated that the development of herzyme would require additional funds of up to million and  therefore  elan made available to us a million credit facility  which was convertible into series b convertible preferred stock  to fund our portion of medizyme operating costs over a month period 
at december   we had utilized the credit facility and had borrowed million 
the note carried an interest rate of compounded on a semi annual basis 
elan converted this debt and accrued interest into shares of our series b convertible preferred stock in june in june and october  we completed draw downs of  and  respectively  against the credit facility  which are recorded as preferred shares issuable under equity on our balance sheet 
at december   the series b convertible preferred stock  which accrues dividends at a annual rate of  is convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
in aggregate  at december   all of our outstanding preferred stock and accreted dividends with elan are convertible into million shares of our common stock 
as of december   the series a and b preferred stock have liquidation preferences of million and million  respectively 
in addition  elan purchased  shares of our common stock and a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share in december for million 
in mid  elan announced that it would limit the focus of its clinical programs 
elan s announced clinical programs do not include cancer programs 
while we have not received formal notice from elan concerning our collaboration arrangement  based on elan s public statements  we believe that following completion of our phase i study later this year  it is unlikely that elan will continue to support herzyme development 
we do not intend to pursue development of herzyme without a new corporate partner 
in august  we announced that we are realigning our research and development programs to focus our internal development on only those programs we believe have a high likelihood of commercial success 
we discontinued our heptazyme program and began leveraging our nucleic acid expertise to develop rnai based therapeutics and develop diagnostic technologies for use by our collaborators and also plan to enter into licensing  process development and manufacturing arrangements 
as a result  we reorganized certain departments and reduced staff 
we expect that these actions will reduce operating expenses by approximately in in october  we committed to a minimum three month severance agreement for all current employees for termination without cause 
along with other senior management severance agreements  company wide severance if effected  would cost approximately million 
proposed private placement 
in february  we entered into a definitive common stock and warrant purchase agreement the stock purchase agreement with sprout group  oxford bioscience partners iv  venrock associates  tvm v life science ventures gmbh co 
kg and granite global ventures the investors pursuant to which we have agreed to issue and sell and the investors have agreed to purchase shares of our common stock and five year warrants to purchase common stock for aggregate consideration of million 
the purchase price will be per share  however  the price is subject to reduction if we breach representations and warranties made in the stock purchase agreement to per share 
based on the assumed per share purchase price  we will issue to the investors  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock exercisable at per share 
as a result of their combined approximate ownership after giving effect to the exercise of the warrants and other stock issuances pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  together with board representation  the investors will have control over rpi following consummation of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement 
the investors will have the right to designate four of our seven board members 
consummation of the transactions is subject to a number of conditions  including  but not limited to approval of our stockholders  appointment to the board of the four investor designees  adoption of an amended and restated certificate of incorporation in order to effect a reverse stock split  change the company s name  increase the number of authorized shares  adopt a provision permitting shareholder action to be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting  execution by our officers  key employees and consultants of non competition and non solicitation agreements  no material adverse change prior to closing  and  amendment of our bylaws 
in connection with the execution of the stock purchase agreement  we obtained certain waivers and amendments to the agreements with schering ag and to our agreements with elan 
schering has agreed to restructure our debt obligations to them 
among other things  elan has agreed to convert all of the outstanding shares of our series a and series b preferred stock into shares of our common stock immediately prior to the closing of the transaction  to waive certain pre emptive rights  and to waive its right to nominate a director for election to our board of directors 
each of schering and elan granted these waivers based on the condition that the transactions are consummated without material changes from the terms that were presented to them 
as one of the conditions to the investors obligation to close  these waivers  and other consents  must be in effect at closing 
the execution of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement will have a highly dilutive effect on current stockholders in that the percentage ownership of our current stockholders will decline significantly as a result of the additional shares issued pursuant to the stock purchase agreement 
the number of shares issued pursuant to the stock purchase agreement will increase substantially the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding 
this means that our current stockholders will own a much smaller interest in us as a result of the completion of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement 
for purposes of example only  a stockholder who owned of our outstanding stock as of february   would own just of the shares outstanding immediately after the completion of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement 
we anticipate that  with the consummation of the private placement transaction  our existing financial resources and expected revenues from collaborations  our cash should be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital requirements into we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including costs related to our research  drug discovery and development programs  preclinical studies of our products  if developed  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  general administrative and legal fees  and manufacturing and marketing of our products  if any 
we will continue to need to raise additional capital through any or all of the following public or private financing  merger or acquisition  new collaborative relationships  new credit facilities and or other sources 
if we raise funds by selling more stock  your ownership share in us will be diluted 
we may grant future investors rights superior to those of existing shareholders 
in addition  we do not know if additional funding will be available or on acceptable terms when needed 
at december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  for income tax purposes 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation in future periods pursuant to the change in ownership rules under section of the internal revenue code 
risk factors we are a biotechnology company in the early stage of development and have only a limited operating history for you to review in evaluating our business and prospects 
our ribozyme and rnai technologies are in an early stage of development and will require further testing before we can apply them to developing rna based therapeutic products 
there can be no assurance that our technologies will enable us  or any of our collaborators  to discover and develop therapeutic products 
all of our products are in early stages of development  have never generated any sales and require extensive testing before commercialization 
we do not expect our most advanced drug angiozyme to be commercially available for several years  if at all 
furthermore our rnai based drugs will require even longer development times 
you must consider  based on our limited history  our ability to obtain the financial resources necessary to develop  test  manufacture and market products  engage corporate partners to assist in developing  testing  manufacturing and marketing our products  satisfy the requirements of clinical trial protocols  including patient enrollment  establish and demonstrate the clinical efficacy and safety of our products  obtain necessary regulatory approvals  and market our products to achieve acceptance and use by the medical community in general 
if we complete the proposed stock purchase transaction  you may experience substantial dilution 
you may experience substantial dilution if we complete the proposed stock purchase transaction 
the purchase price will equal either or per share 
in addition to purchasing shares of our common stock  the investors will purchase warrants exercisable at per share for shares of our common stock 
in conjunction with negotiating the stock purchase agreement  we also negotiated an agreement with elan as a result of which elan will  at closing of the proposed transaction  convert all of its outstanding series a and series b convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock and receive additional warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
as a result of all of these changes  your ownership stake in our company may be substantially diluted and we expect that existing stockholders will own approximately of our outstanding stock 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will ever become or remain profitable 
we have incurred significant losses and have had negative cash flows from operations since inception 
to date  we have dedicated most of our financial resources to research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we have funded our activities primarily from sales of our stock  revenues we receive under research and development agreements  and lines of credit 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect that the use of our net operating loss will be significantly restricted in the future as a result of a change of control associated with the proposed stock purchase transaction 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years because we plan to spend substantial amounts on research and development of our products  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  and  if we obtain necessary regulatory approvals  on sales and marketing efforts 
if we cannot obtain additional financing  we may curtail our research and development  relinquish our rights to some or all of our products or declare bankruptcy 
our existing financial resources and expected revenues from our collaborations are insufficient to continue to meet our operating and capital requirements at existing levels 
we need to raise substantial additional capital to pursue our business strategy  which requires significant expenditures for research and development and preclinical and clinical development 
our financing alternatives have proven to be limited 
if we cannot complete the previously announced stock purchase transaction  we will be required to consider curtailing our research and development plans  selling some or all of our intellectual property  selling our diagnostics business  or winding up our operations and declaring bankruptcy 
there can be no assurance that if we choose to attempt to sell some or all of our intellectual property  or if we choose to sell our diagnostic business  that we will be able to do so  or that if we are able to complete sales  that we will be able to complete sales on terms and conditions that are favorable to us 
there is a significant degree of uncertainty relating to our patents that could cause us to incur substantial costs and delays as a result of proceedings and litigation regarding patents and other proprietary rights 
the ultimate result of any patent litigation could be the loss of some or all protection for the patent involved 
we have filed patent applications on various aspects of rnai technology that have not yet been approved 
we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
the scope of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection against competitive products 
our basic ribozyme patents  the cech patents  unless extended  expire in in the united states and in in europe and japan 
although our license to these ribozyme patents extends through the expiration of the cech patents or any extensions thereof  our licensor preserves the right to terminate our license before such time under certain circumstances 
we have received approval of some additional patent applications covering various aspects of the nucleic acid and ribozyme technology  and we have filed patent applications for other technology improvements and modifications that have not yet been approved 
we cannot be certain that the named inventors of subject matter claimed by our patents and patent applications were the first to invent or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
we have filed documents in opposition of one ribozyme related patent granted to a competitor in europe 
competitors have filed documents in opposition of our cech patents in europe and japan on ribozyme technology 
the patent opposition in japan has been resolved in our favor 
the european opposition proceeding is in progress 
however  at the oral proceedings in july  the european opposition division found no grounds for revoking the cech patents but decided to clarify the scope of the claims to cover self splicing intervening sequence derived ribozymes 
this decision is on appeal at the european patent office technical board 
we anticipate interference proceedings involving one of our ribozyme related patents in the united states 
we are also involved in a re examination proceeding involving one of our patents in the united states 
the manufacture  use or sale of our products may infringe on the patent rights of others 
if we are unable to avoid infringing another party s patent rights  we may be required to seek a license  defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court 
patent litigation is costly and time consuming 
we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion 
in addition  if we do not obtain a license  do not successfully defend an infringement action or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid  we may incur substantial monetary damages  encounter significant delays in marketing our products  and be unable to participate in the manufacture  use or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring licenses 
in addition  we regularly enter into agreements to in license technologies and patent rights 
should we fail to comply with the terms of those license agreements  including payment of any required maintenance fees or royalties  we would lose the rights to those technologies and patents 
we may not have identified all united states and foreign patents that pose a risk of infringement 
we may be forced to litigate if an intellectual property dispute arises 
this litigation could be extremely expensive 
proceedings and litigation involving our patents or patent applications also could result in adverse findings about the patentability of our inventions and product candidates  or the enforceability  validity or scope of protection provided by our patents 
as discussed above  our competitors have taken the position in patent oppositions and elsewhere that our patents are invalid or that our activities infringe on their ribozyme related patent rights 
while we do not believe we are infringing on the patent rights of our known competitors  we may have to incur substantial costs if litigation is brought against us by these competitors 
we depend upon our collaborative relationships and our collaborators have rights under these agreements which if exercised could impair our ability to develop our products and our operating results 
engaging corporate partners and other third parties to develop  test and manufacture our initial products has been  and is expected to continue to be  a key element of our strategy 
our current partners  chiron and elan  have the right to terminate unilaterally our existing agreements or to discontinue funding their share of product development expenses 
based on public statements made by elan  we do not believe that elan is likely to continue funding our collaboration for the development of herzyme 
we will not continue with independent development of this product 
generally  if any of our current partners were to terminate its funding of the development of a particular product  we may not have the right or resources to continue development of that product on our own 
in addition  there are many aspects of our collaborations that have been and will continue to be outside of our control including decisions by our collaborators to extend or renew our agreements and relationships  the pace of development of our products including the achievement of performance milestones  development by our collaborators of competing technologies or products  exercise by our collaborators of marketing or manufacturing rights  and the loss of our rights to products or the profits from our products if we are unable to fund our share of development costs 
because we must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation by a wide range of authorities 
we cannot predict whether regulatory clearance will be obtained for any product we develop 
a pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the united states until it has completed rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the food and drug administration  the fda 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years  depends upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
of particular significance are the requirements covering research and development  testing  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
before commencing clinical trials in humans  we must submit and receive approval from the fda for an ind 
clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the fda and must be conducted in conformity with the fda s good laboratory practice regulations  must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight  must meet requirements for informed consent  must meet requirements for good clinical practices  are subject to continuing fda oversight  may require large numbers of test subjects  and may be suspended by the fda or us at any time if it is believed that the subjects participating in these trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or if the fda finds deficiencies in the ind or the conduct of these trials 
before receiving fda clearance to market a product  we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective on the patient population that will be treated 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearances 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
failure to comply with applicable fda or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production or injunction  as well as other regulatory action against our potential products or us 
additionally  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval 
if regulatory clearance of a product is granted  this clearance will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and efficacious 
we cannot ensure that any compound developed by us  alone or with others  will prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing clearance 
outside the united states  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
this foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda clearance described above 
our products require materials that may not be readily available or cost effective  which may reduce our competitiveness or reduce our profitability 
the products we are developing are new chemical entities that are not yet available in commercial quantities 
raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products may not be available in sufficient quantities or at a reasonable cost in the future 
therefore  our products may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future 
disclosure of our trade secrets could reduce our competitiveness 
because trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information are critical to our business  we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
however  these agreements can be breached and  if they are  there may not be an adequate remedy available to us 
in addition  third parties may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights 
we lack sales and marketing experience and will likely rely upon third parties to market our products that will result in a loss of control over the marketing process 
we currently intend to rely on third parties with established direct sales forces to market  distribute and sell many of our products 
these third parties may have significant control over important aspects of the commercialization of our products  including market identification  marketing methods  pricing  sales force recruitment and management and promotional activities 
we may be unable to control the actions of these third parties 
we may be unable to make or maintain arrangements with third parties to perform these activities on favorable terms 
our success may depend on third party reimbursement of patients costs for our products that could result in price pressure or reduced demand for our products 
our ability to market products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which various third parties are willing to reimburse patients for the costs of our products and related treatments 
these third parties include government authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
accordingly  if less costly drugs are available  third party payers may not authorize or may limit reimbursement for our products  even if our products are safer or more effective than the alternatives 
in addition  the trend toward managed healthcare and government insurance programs could result in lower prices and reduced demand for our products 
cost containment measures instituted by healthcare providers and any general healthcare reform could affect our ability to sell our products and may have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot predict the effect of future legislation or regulation concerning the healthcare industry and third party coverage and reimbursement on our business 
following completion of the proposed stock purchase transaction  a small number of investors could control all of our activities 
if we complete the proposed stock purchase transaction  the investors will own approximately of our outstanding stock after giving effect to the exercise of the warrants and other stock issuances pursuant to the stock purchase agreement 
in addition  the investors will have the right to select four of seven designees to our board of directors 
in connection with the proposed stock purchase transaction  we also have agreed to seek stockholder approval for an amendment to our amended certificate of incorporation that would permit stockholder action to be taken by written consent instead of by means of an actual meeting 
as a result of all of these changes  if we complete the proposed stock purchase transaction  the investors will be able to take any action  even those actions that  under delaware law  require the affirmative vote of a supermajority of the stockholders  by written consent  without the need for a stockholders meeting 
for example  if the investors were to act in concert  the investors could decide to take the company private  to sell some or all of its assets  or to effect a merger without holding a stockholder s meeting 
if the investors were to act in concert  they would have sufficient voting power to effect these types of transactions  although they have not indicated any present intent to do so 
our common stock has limited trading volume and a history of volatility that could impair your investment 
you may be unable to sell securities you purchase from us at the time or price desired 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated dramatically in recent years 
the trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate substantially due to quarterly variations in our operating results  our ability to raise additional funds  completion of our proposed reverse stock split  ownership interest of the new investors  changes in the status of our corporate collaborative agreements  changes in earnings estimates by market research analysts  clinical trials of products  research activities  technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  purchases or sales of our stock by our executive officers  directors or substantial holders of our common stock  timing or denial by the fda of clinical trial protocols or marketing applications  securities class actions or other litigation  and changes in government regulations 
these fluctuations have sometimes been unrelated to our operating performance 
as a result  the value of your shares could vary significantly from time to time 
the historical trading volume of our common stock has been limited 
after this offering  an active public market for the common stock may not develop or be sustained 
both our corporate documents and delaware law have anti takeover provisions that may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control at premium prices 
our corporate documents and provisions of delaware law applicable to us include provisions that discourage change of control transactions 
for example  our corporate documents require procedures to be followed and specify time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters for consideration at annual stockholder meetings  including the nomination of directors for election at those meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations of preferred stock  including the voting rights  at its discretion 
in addition  we are subject to provisions of delaware general corporations law that may make some business combinations more difficult 
as a result  transactions that otherwise could involve the premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock may be discouraged or may be more difficult for us to effect as compared to companies organized in other jurisdictions 
we are involved in pending litigation and cannot at this time predict the ultimate outcome or possible loss that could result from that litigation 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit brought as a class action on behalf of purchasers of our common stock on november and  the lawsuit alleged the defendants violated certain federal securities laws based upon an allegedly misleading announcement made on november  on november   we announced that an agreement has been reached with the plaintiffs to settle the shareholder class action lawsuit 
at a hearing on march   the court approved the settlement as proposed and will issue an order confirming the approval shortly 
our liability insurance policy has agreed to cover the full amount of the settlement 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
we were notified by the nasdaq stock market  inc on march  that we had failed to comply with the marketplace rules for continued listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
specifically  we were advised that we failed to meet the minimum bid price requirement because our common stock has closed at less than per share since september and we failed to comply with the minimum million stockholders equity requirement 
we have requested  and been granted  an appeal 
during the time leading up to our appeal later in april  the delisting of our common stock will be stayed 
although we believe that the proposed private placement transaction  as well as our proposed reverse stock split  may permit us to meet nasdaq s requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal 
if we are not successful and our common stock is delisted  the market for our securities will not be as liquid 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain short term investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments that are typically held for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
accordingly  we believe that  while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments
