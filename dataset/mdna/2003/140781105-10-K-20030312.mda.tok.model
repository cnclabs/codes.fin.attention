item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general business conditions carbo ceramics inc s principal business consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is the most common technique used to stimulate production from hydrocarbon bearing formations 
the process involves pumping fluids into an oil or gas well at very high pressure in order to fracture the rock formation that contains the hydrocarbons 
as the fracture is created  the fluids are blended with granular materials  or proppant  which fill the fracture and prop it open after the pressure pumping ceases 
the proppant filled fracture creates a highly permeable channel that enables the oil or gas to flow more freely from the formation  thereby increasing production from the well 
ceramic proppants are premium products that are sold at higher prices than sand or resin coated sand  the two primary alternative proppants 
the principal advantage of ceramic proppants is that they are stronger than sand based proppants 
the higher strength of ceramic proppant results in higher production rates in deep wells where sand or resin coated sand may be crushed under high closure stress 
consequently  the level of deep drilling activity generally defined as wells deeper than  feet influences the company s business 
ceramic proppants are also more uniform in size and shape than sand based proppants 
this uniformity can result in higher production rates than sand based proppants when used in wells that do not otherwise require ceramics for their higher strength 
as deep drilling  particularly in north america  is typically focused on the production of natural gas  the company s business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on the present value economics of comparing the higher cost of ceramic proppant to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is influenced by the price of natural gas and oil 
the company s performance is particularly influenced by the level of natural gas drilling activity in north america  where it typically generates in excess of of it is revenues 
the north american natural gas market remained very strong through the first half of in addition  the company began to see significant benefit from the success of its technical marketing program that promotes the economic benefit of using ceramic proppant in shallower wells 
as a result of the strong market conditions in north america  the company s marketing success and the increased capacity available from its mcintyre  georgia production facility  the company established new annual records for sales volume  average selling price  revenues and net income in despite a downturn in north american natural gas drilling activity in the second half of the year 
this decline in north american drilling activity continued through much of in  the average natural gas rig count declined by in the us and in canada compared to despite the weak market conditions  the company established a new annual record for sales volume in canada while sales in the us declined by 
management believes that these sales figures are evidence of the success of the company s technical marketing effort and represent a further penetration of the total proppant market by ceramic proppant 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer upon delivery 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
as stated in note to the consolidated financial statements  credit losses historically have been insignificant 
therefore  except in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  the company generally does not record a reserve for bad debts 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  its estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the company s financial condition could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
the company is subject to legal proceedings  claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
management does not believe the company is party to any legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions related to those proceedings 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of an acquired enterprise is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
if necessary  these estimates can be revised during an allocation period when information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the allocation period does not exceed a period of one year from the date of acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the purchase price allocation would be adjusted accordingly 
should information become available after the allocation period  the effects would be reflected in operating results 
results of operations percent percent change change in thousands net income    the company reported net income for that was lower than the previous year 
the primary factor contributing to the reduction in net income was a significant decrease in north american gas drilling activity that began in the second half of and continued into the average domestic natural gas rig count for was lower than  while the average price of natural gas in the us decreased by from the previous year 
the reduction in revenues  increased manufacturing costs and increased selling  general and administrative expenses contributed to the decline in net income 
the company s net income for was higher than the previous year 
a very strong north american natural gas market was the driving force behind a significant increase in net income for the year 
the number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the us reached record levels in mid year before declining significantly during the second half 
despite this decrease in activity  demand for the company s products remained strong resulting in improved manufacturing efficiency from operating manufacturing facilities at or near capacity throughout the year 
individual components of operating results are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands revenues    carbo ceramics inc s revenues of million were lower than revenues 
revenues in included million from pinnacle technologies inc  which was acquired by the company on may  total proppant sales volume decreased by  with domestic volume down and export volume down by  despite a drop in the us rig count and a decline in the worldwide rig count compared to the company believes that these relatively strong results in a weak market indicate that the company s ceramic proppants continue to gain market share due to the success of the company s technical marketing program and expanded distribution network 
the decreased domestic volume was due to a drop in sales in south texas  while decreased export sales were attributable to reduced sales into south america  australia  and mexico 
increased sales in russia and canada offset some of the export declines 
the average selling price of per pound in improved slightly versus per pound in the company s revenues in of million were higher than total sales volume increased  with domestic volume up and export volume down compared to the company believes that this increase was due to both strong natural gas drilling activity in north america and the success of its technical marketing program designed to increase the use of ceramic proppant in wells that have traditionally used sand based proppants 
in both us and canada  the company s sales volume increased by a larger percentage than industry activity as measured by the number of rigs actively drilling for oil or gas 
the export sales decline was attributable to increased competition  particularly in russia  and the company s decision to supply domestic markets in a capacity constrained environment during much of the year 
the average selling price for the year was per pound  an increase of over the year contributing to this was a january price increase of approximately  and a slight shift in the product mix toward higher strength products 
gross profit percent percent change change in thousands gross profit    gross profit the company s cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs and packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers 
variable manufacturing expenses include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing expenses include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
certain handling costs related to maintaining finished goods inventory and operating the company s remote stocking facilities are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
those costs amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross profit decreased by from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to reduced sales volume 
the reduction in gross profit margins was directly related to the company s manufacturing facilities operating at approximately of capacity in versus of capacity in this was caused by both reduced sales volumes and unscheduled downtime at the mcintyre production facility due to unanticipated maintenance requirements 
the impact of this was partially offset by the lower cost of natural gas used at the manufacturing facilities during and reduced freight costs in transporting finished goods from the plants to remote storage locations 
gross profit increased by from to gross profit as a percentage of sales was for  compared to for the improvement in gross profit was the result of both the significant increase in sales volume and improved pricing 
improved operating efficiency in manufacturing facilities contributed to increased gross profit margins with manufacturing facilities running at of capacity in versus of capacity in partially offsetting this was the effect of higher natural gas costs in our manufacturing operations and increased freight costs due to lower than desired inventory levels at remote storage locations 
selling  general administrative expenses and start up costs percent percent change change in thousands sg a    sg a as a of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses and start up costs increased by million in over sg a and start up expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in from in the most significant items were start up costs related to the new manufacturing facility in china and a  reserve related to a judgment against the company in a lawsuit alleging tortious interference with a contract

the company generated cash from operations of million  realized proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock for exercises of employee stock options  and generated million from maturing investment securities 
total capital expenditures for the year were million  cash dividends paid totaled million  and million was expended on the repayment of bank loans extended to pinnacle technologies 
in addition  million in cash was expended as part of the pinnacle acquisition the total purchase price was million 
major capital spending items during included spending on a new manufacturing facility in china  improvements and additions to remote storage locations  and improvements at the mcintyre manufacturing facility to debottleneck the current production process and improve equipment reliability in order to increase production capacity 
the company s current intention  subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of its common stock at the rate of per share 
the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million

the company anticipates that cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations and capital expenditures through also  based on the strength of its balance sheet  the company believes that it could acquire additional debt financing 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact its investment in china 
when necessary  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
there were no such foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company has a million line of credit with its primary commercial bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company may elect to pay interest at either a fluctuating base rate established by the bank from time to time or at a rate based on the rate established in the london inter bank market 
the company does not believe that it has any material exposure to market risk associated with interest rates
