item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant events affecting the company s earnings and financial condition during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s operations are in one line of business  electronic contract manufacturing services ems 
this includes the design  development and or manufacture of electronic parts and assemblies for both government and commercial customers worldwide 
governmental sales are mainly sonobuoys 
commercial customers are in general industrial markets  as well as the regulated aerospace and medical markets 
the private securities litigation reform act of reflects congress determination that the disclosures of forward looking information is desirable for investors and encourages such disclosure by providing a safe harbor for forward looking statements by corporate management 
the following discussion about the company s results of operations and financial condition contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  growth forecasts and results of the company s business include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  customer demand for products  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation 
an additional risk factor is the availability and cost of materials 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components in the past  which have resulted in higher prices and late deliveries 
finally  the timing of sonobuoy sales is dependent upon access to  and successful passage of  product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and frequent than in the past 
management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales for the year ended june   totaled  an increase of  from fiscal overall  sales were below the company s original plan  but in line with revised expectations given the continued depressed economic environment 
government ems sales decreased to  while other ems sales increased 
sales included   and  of industrial  aerospace and medical scientific instrumentation sales  respectively 
while government sales declined slightly from last year  the increase in other ems sales reflects primarily strong demand for homeland security products and the current focus to install detection equipment in us and canadian airports 
while homeland security product demand may begin to slow in fiscal  it is anticipated that other areas will increase as the economy improves 
operating profits of  and  were reported for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
gross margins were consistent with prior year 
margins on government programs improved as the company concluded production of several problem plagued sonobuoy contracts 
these contracts carried no gross margin and their revenues totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal at june   these contracts were complete 
one contract was completed during the first half of fiscal previously estimated rework was not required resulting in increased margins of  during this period 
inventory and rework issues for two other customers reduced margins by  during the year 
given the reduced level of sales  the company continues to experience underutilized capacity 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in and in decreased slightly from last year as the company continues to monitor expenses with a focus on cost control 
included in operating income was a  recovery of certain remediation costs negotiated this year 
it reflects sparton s settlement with the doe and others regarding reimbursement of costs incurred at the company s sparton technology coors road facility 
also included were current year charges related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally litigation  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these epa charges are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest and investment income increased  to  in  due to increased funds available for investment 
investment securities are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other income net was  and  in and  respectively 
other income net in includes  of net transaction and translation gains relating to the company s canadian subsidiary as a result of the stronger canadian dollar in fiscal  primarily in the fourth quarter 
additionally    in of costs related to potential insurance adjustments for the company s previously owned automotive segment are included 
other income net in included a one time recovery of  when a former insurer converted to a stock company formerly a mutual company 
equity loss in investment was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s investment in cybernet systems corporation cybernet represents a ownership interest  which was acquired in june nyse spa

the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the favorable tax rate was principally due to the tax benefit attributable to foreign sales and the utilization of a contribution carryforward benefit from in addition  a portion of the canadian net operating loss carryforward nolcf from prior years was utilized 
a valuation allowance had been recorded on both of these carryforwards at june  the tax effect of foreign currency transactions and translation further reduced the effective tax rate 
after provision for applicable income taxes as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company reported net income of  per share  diluted in fiscal  compared to  per share  basic and diluted in fiscal fiscal includes income related to the epa settlement of   net of tax 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales for the year ended june   totaled  a decrease of  from fiscal overall  sales were below the company s original plan  but in line with revised expectations given the economic environment and events of september  government ems sales increased to  while other ems sales declined 
other sales included   and  of industrial  aerospace and medical scientific instrumentation sales  respectively 
the increase in govern ment sales was due to accelerated sonobuoy production  and higher than expected foreign sonobuoy sales 
the decline in other ems sales reflected the then market uncertainties  particularly related to aerospace and the general economic recession 
the uncertainty of demand in the commercial markets led to additional measures to monitor and control costs and expenses 
operating profits of  and  were reported for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
gross margins for the year improved approximately 
the higher gross margin in fiscal was reflective of a more favorable mix of government sales and continuing cost containment measures 
however  given the reduced level of sales the company continued to experience underutilized capacity 
margins on government programs improved as the company concluded production of sonobuoy contracts that were loss contracts 
these contracts carried no gross margin and their revenues totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal at june   the remaining backlog of these loss contracts approximated million 
selling and administrative expenses were significantly below last year as the company continued to focus on cost control 
included were charges against income related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally litigation  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal these epa charges are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest and investment income increased  to  in fiscal investment securities are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item other income net was  in fiscal  as previously discussed  and  in equity loss in investment was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at june   sparton changed its method of accounting for its investment in cybernet systems corporation cybernet  which accounting is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company s effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared to the statutory us federal tax rate of 
the favorable tax rate was principally due to the tax benefit attributable to foreign sales 
after provision for applicable income taxes as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company reported net income of  per share in fiscal  compared to  per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been from operations 
short term credit facilities have been used in the past  but not recently 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work declines  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
at the present time  the company plans on using its investment securities to provide working capital and to strategically invest in additional property  plant and equipment to accommodate growth 
growth is expected to be achieved through internal expansion and or acquisition or joint venture 
the company is currently exploring the possibility of a manufacturing facility in asia 
the company has had no short term debt since december  and currently has unused informal lines of credit totalling million with two banks 
cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  in the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was mainly attributable to the doe settlement of   of the settlement was received  the remaining  of the settlement will be received in fiscal in addition  a reduction in inventory levels provided operating cash flow 
inventory reduction is a reflection of the company s focus on improving inventory turnover through ordering and usage efficiency gains in this area over the past year 
in addition  due to the higher fourth quarter sales  inventory levels are lower than would normally be expected to occur 
other primary sources included income from operations  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased primarily due to deferred commissions from year end sales  deferred revenue from one customer and inventory purchases at one location 
in fiscal  the primary cash flow use was an increase in accounts receivable  reflecting high sonobuoy and homeland security product sales near year end

cash flows used by investing activities totaled  in fiscal the major use of cash by investing activities was the purchase of investment securities 
cash flows used provided by investing activities were  and  in the fiscal years ended and  respectively  primarily from purchase and sale of investment securities 
cash flows provided by financing activities were  primarily resulting from an exercise of stock options 
cash flows used by financing activities were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
these funds were used to purchase shares of common stock for the treasury 
at june   the company had  in working capital and total shareowners equity of  contractual obligations the company s current obligations for the payment of accounts payable and accruals totaling  at june   are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet included in item in addition  there are a number of non cancellable purchase orders that are payable within the next months 
these contracts are not material to sparton s operations or cash flow position 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  plan assets of the company s defined benefits plan exceed the plan s benefit obligation at june  at june   other contractual obligations and long term liabilities are as follows payments due by period total years operating leases     environmental liabilities      total      for a description of the accrual for environmental remediation  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
in december  the company increased its accrual for the estimated cost of addressing the environmental impacts associated with its coors road facility by  pre tax 
this increase was reflective of revised cost estimates in conjunction with the negotiated consent decree that settled related lawsuits then outstanding  as well as a related administrative enforcement action  and covered activities expected to be incurred over the next thirty years 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
nyse spa 
sparton logo 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts on a quarterly basis  revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change significantly as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
significant changes in estimate can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances contracts with commercial customers are based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
the establishment of inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories requires a significant degree of judgment and is influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for possible losses on receivables accounts receivable are customer obligations generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit terms are granted and periodically revised based on evaluations of the customers financial condition 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and although the company does not generally require collateral  letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances 
receivables from foreign customers are generally secured by letters of credit or cash advances 
the company maintains an allowance for possible losses on receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for possible losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
pension obligations each year we calculate the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as modified by sfas nos 
and the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on our current view of long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from our assumptions  future adjustments to our financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligations reported in the consolidated balance sheets and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts discussed below  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have a significant effect on net periodic pension costs in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent our assumptions differ from actual results  there would be a future impact on our financial statements 
the changes would not  however  have an immediate effect in the period of change as expense determination under sfas no 
includes provisions that minimize the volatility of annual expense 
the effect of these assumptions versus actual differences accumulates over time in an unrecognized net gain or loss account 
to the extent the unrecognized account balance exceeds certain thresholds as defined in the accounting standards  the excess is amortized to or against expense in future nyse spa

periods 
the decrease in our discount rate assumption combined with a reduction in our plan asset values due to market conditions over the past few years have contributed to the increase in the unrecognized loss in our pension plan account balance 
at june   the balance was a net loss of  compared to a net loss of  at june  the extent to which this unrecognized net loss will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
for example  an increase in the return on our plan assets due to improved market conditions would reduce the unrecognized loss account and thus reduce future expense 
other litigation one of sparton s facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico  has been the subject of ongoing investigations conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the investigation began in the early s and involved a review of onsite and offsite environmental impacts 
at june   sparton has an accrual of  as its estimate of the future undiscounted minimum financial liability with respect to this matter 
the company s cost estimate is based upon existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs  which are expensed as incurred 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for onsite and offsite operations and is based on existing methodology 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
in  sparton corporation and sparton technology  inc sti filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county  illinois  against lumbermens mutual casualty company and american manufacturers mutual insurance company demanding reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with its remediation efforts at the coors road facility based on various primary and excess comprehensive general liability policies in effect between and in  the complaint was amended to add various other excess insurers  including certain london market insurers and fireman s fund insurance company 
the case remains in pretrial activity 
in september  sti filed an action in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan to recover certain unreimbursed costs incurred as a result of a manufacturing relationship with two entities  util link  llc util link of delaware and national rural telecommunications cooperative nrtc of the district of columbia 
on or about october   the defendants filed a counterclaim seeking money damages  alleging that sti breached its duties in the manufacture of products for the defendants 
the defendant util link has asked for damages in the amount of  for lost profits 
the defendant nrtc has asked for damages in the amount  for the loss of its investment in and loans to util link 
sparton has not had an opportunity to fully assess the respective claims  but believes that the damages sought by nrtc are included in util link s claim for damages and as such  are duplicative 
sparton believes the counterclaim to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it 
this case is in the initial stages of discovery 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the amount of recovery  if any  that may result from the pursuit of these two before mentioned claims 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states and canada 
sales of the company s products are made in the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and  historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
the company does not consider the market risk exposure relating to currency exchange to be material 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  the interest rate risk is not considered to be material
