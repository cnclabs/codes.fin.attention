item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
general hastings entertainment is a leading multimedia entertainment retailer that combines the sale of books  music  software  periodicals  videocassettes  video games  dvds  used products including cds  dvds and video games  video game consoles and dvd players with the rental of videocassettes  video games  dvds  video game consoles and dvd players in a superstore and internet web site format 
as of january   we operated superstores averaging approximately  square feet in small to medium sized markets located in states  primarily in the western and midwestern united states 
each of the superstores is wholly owned by the company and operates under the name of hastings 
our operating strategy is to enhance our position as a multimedia entertainment retailer by expanding and remodeling existing superstores  opening new superstores in selected markets  and offering our products through our internet web site 
references herein to fiscal years are to the twelve month periods that end in january of the following calendar year 
for example  the twelve month period ended january  is referred to as fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant estimates and assumptions are reviewed  and any required adjustments are recorded  on a monthly basis 
lower of cost or market for merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
as with any retailer  economic conditions  cyclical customer demand and changes in purchasing or distribution can affect the carrying value of inventory 
as circumstances warrant  we record lower of cost or market lcm inventory adjustments 
in some instances  these adjustments can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in order to determine such adjustments  we evaluate the age  inventory turns and estimated fair value of merchandise inventory by product category and record any adjustment if estimated market value is below cost 
through merchandising and an automated progressive markdown program  we quickly take the steps necessary to increase the sell off of slower moving merchandise to eliminate or lessen the effect of any lcm adjustments 
returns process 
merchandise inventory owned by us is generally returnable based upon return agreements with our merchandise vendors 
we continually return merchandise to vendors based on  among other factors  current and projected sales trends  overstock situations  authorized return timelines or change in product offerings 
at the end of any reporting period cost accruals are required for inventory that has been returned to vendors  or is in the process of being returned to vendors  or has been identified to be returned to vendors 
these costs can include freight  valuation and quantity differences  and other fees charged by a vendor 
in order to appropriately match the costs associated with the return of merchandise with the process of returning such merchandise  we utilize an allowance for cost of inventory returns the allowance 
to accrue for such costs and estimate the allowance  we utilize historical experience adjusted for significant estimated or contractual modifications 
certain adjustments to the allowance can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
rental video cost amortization 
we have a series of direct revenue sharing agreements with major studios and we anticipate that our future involvement in revenue sharing agreements will be similar to that of fiscal year revenue sharing allows us to acquire rental video assets at a lower up front capital cost than traditional buying arrangements 
we then share with studios a percentage of the actual net rental revenues generated over a contractually determined period of time 
the increased access to additional copies of new releases under revenue sharing agreements allows customer demand for new releases to be satisfied over a shorter period of time at a time when the new releases are most popular 
under the terms of the specific contracts with supplying studios  we expense revenue sharing payments through rental video cost of revenue  as revenues are recognized 
the capitalized cost of all rental video assets acquired for a fixed price is being amortized on an accelerated basis over six months to a salvage value of per unit  except for rental video assets purchased for the initial stock of a new superstore  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over months to a salvage value of certain events  including a downturn in the rental video industry as a whole or in the markets within which we operate our superstores  further consolidation of rental video retailers  substantial change in customer demand and change in the mix of rental video revenues  could affect the salvage value we have assigned to our rental video assets 
the effect could result in a material reduction of the carrying value of our rental video assets and have a material impact on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
in particular  the growth of the dvd market and the shift of consumer purchases from vhs videocassettes to dvd could result in a decrease in the salvage value of rental videos 
at some point during the rental cycle  a vhs item  as with dvd and games  is available for purchase by a customer as a previously viewed tape pvt 
our current experience is that the amount received for the pvt is higher than our salvage value of that item in our rental inventory 
based in part on this factor and sales of pvts  we believe our estimate of salvage value is appropriate 
store closing reserve 
on a quarterly basis  and in the normal course of business  we evaluate our store base to determine if a need to close or relocate a store s is present 
management will evaluate  among other factors  current and future profitability  market trends  age of store and lease status 
the primary expense items associated with the closure of a store relate to the net present value of minimum lease payments the present value of remaining lease payments under an active lease and the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets not remaining in our possession at the time the location is closed or relocated 
the amount recorded can fluctuate based on the age of the closing location  term and remaining years of the lease and the number of stores being closed or relocated 
these charges can have a material effect on the financial results of an annual or interim period 
we actively pursue sublease tenants on all closed or relocated locations and the impact of any sublease income is estimated in the determination of the incurred store closing reserve liability 
revenue recognition 
the company s revenue is primarily from retail sales and rental of our products 
merchandise and rental revenues are recognized at the point of sale or rental or at the time merchandise is shipped to the customer 
revenues are presented net of estimated returns and exclude all taxes 
customers may return certain merchandise for exchange or refund within the company s policies  and an allowance has been established to provide for projected returns 
there are no provisions for uncollectible amounts since payment is received at the time of sale 
the company  as with most retailers  also offers gift cards for sale 
deferred revenue  a current liability  is recognized at the time a gift card is sold with the costs of designing  printing and distributing the cards recorded as an expense as incurred 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved and revenue is recognized upon the redemption of the gift cards 
from time to time the company will offer sales incentives  in the form of customer rebates  to its customers 
revenue is reduced by the amount of estimated redemptions  based on experience of similar types of rebate offers  and a deferred revenue liability is established 
the deferred revenue liability is relieved when the customer has completed all criteria necessary to file a valid rebate claim 
any remaining portion of deferred revenue is recorded as revenue following the termination of the extended redemption period and following completion of all outstanding rebate claims 
comparable store revenue 
stores included in the comparable store revenues calculation are those stores that have been open for a minimum of weeks 
also included are stores that are remodeled or relocated 
sales via the internet are not included and closed stores are removed from each comparable period for the purpose of calculating comparable store revenues 
results of operations the following tables present our statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of revenue  and the number of superstores open at the end of period for the three most recent fiscal years

total rental video revenues for fiscal increased million  or to million compared to million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in rentals of dvd titles of approximately year over year 
the increase in dvd rentals was partially offset by a decline in vhs rentals 
the acceptance of dvd by the consumer is the primary reason for the decline in vhs rental revenue  but part of the decline resulted from studios increasing the percentage of rental titles released simultaneously for sale at a lower price point  which entices the consumer to purchase a title instead of renting

a higher average loan balance outstanding offset lower interest rates year over year 
interest income 
during the second quarter  we recorded interest income of approximately million as a result of interest earned on income tax refunds for amended returns filed for fiscal years through the company was notified in july that the payment of the refunds  which totaled approximately million  would be processed in august and would be accompanied by interest payments 
all refunds  including interest  were received during fiscal income taxes

total revenues for the fiscal year ending january  were million  up million  or  from million for the fiscal year ending january  primarily due to an increase in total comparable store revenue comps of for the year

partially offsetting these increases in merchandise gross profit was an increase of approximately million in the costs of operating our distribution center 
during fiscal  we implemented a strategy to increase the flow of certain higher turning inventory items through our distribution center 
this program enables us to have a better in stock position for our customers 
for the year  the volume of shipments from our distribution center to our superstores increased approximately in fiscal when compared to fiscal  which resulted in significantly higher operating costs 
rental video gross profit for fiscal  as a percent of rental video revenue  decreased to compared to for fiscal due primarily to i an increase of approximately million in depreciation expenses as we procured a higher level of video games and dvd to meet increasing demand 
a large portion of these purchases were for catalog rental product which exhibit slower turns than a new release title  and ii an increase of approximately million in costs associated with the distribution of rental videos primarily due to increased overhead costs as we processed a greater number of rental assets through our distribution center 
partially offsetting these decreases in rental video gross profit was an increase in margin of approximately million on the rental of revenue sharing titles due to improved terms on agreements with studios 
additionally  a higher percentage of non revenue sharing titles  which generally reflect higher margins  helped to offset the decreases listed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  including store and corporate labor and other overhead costs  for fiscal decreased to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues last year

million in writedowns of certain assets of the company s internet segment were recorded during fiscal this compares to a million writedown of leasehold improvements for two underperforming superstores in fiscal although these superstores continued to operate  such charges were recorded as projected cash flows from these operations were not sufficient to realize the book value of the specific assets  and iii we recorded net expenses of million in fiscal associated with the closure of two superstores during the fourth quarter of fiscal and an additional four superstores approved for closure prior to year end of fiscal this compared to net expenses of million related to two underperforming superstores which were approved for closure during fiscal  one of which was closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the other closed in february such expenses are comprised of accruals for the net present value of future minimum lease payments  the write off of leasehold improvements  and other related costs 
partially offsetting the decreases in sg a expense listed above was an increase in net advertising costs of approximately million year over year 
the higher expense was the result of a planned increase in targeted advertising expenditures during fiscal to increase customer traffic 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses were million for fiscal  as we opened five superstores during the year

during fiscal  interest expense decreased to million  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues for fiscal this reduction was primarily due to lower interest rates as well as a lower average outstanding borrowing during the current year compared to last year 
income taxes 
income tax expense for the fiscal years and was zero and million  respectively 
no income tax expense was recorded related to income for fiscal due to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance related to the net deferred tax asset established in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income loss 
we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share for fiscal year compared to a net loss of million or per share reported for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations exclusively from the sale of merchandise and the rental of video products and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
other than our principal capital requirements arising from the purchase  warehousing and merchandising of inventory and rental videos  opening new superstores and expanding existing superstores and updating existing and implementing new information systems technology  we have no anticipated material capital commitments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operating activities  trade credit from vendors and borrowings under our revolving credit facility the facility 
based on our current internal projections  we believe our cash flow from operations and borrowings under the facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  new superstores and superstore expansions through fiscal consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash flows from operating activities increased million  or to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition to a reduction in net income of approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  we recorded a decline in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million in fiscal compared to an increase of approximately million in fiscal this variance was primarily the result of increased merchandise returns to vendors and the recording of subsequent reductions of amounts owed to those vendors 
offsetting these declines in cash provided by operations was an increase primarily resulting from a planned decline in merchandise inventory during fiscal of approximately million compared to an increase of approximately million during fiscal in addition  we recorded a greater decrease in income taxes receivable in fiscal compared to fiscal of approximately million primarily relating to a net increase in the amount of income tax refunds received during fiscal compared to fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased purchase of rental video assets during fiscal due to new and expanded superstore activity  increased purchases of dvd and video games to meet customer demand and a higher percentage of our total rental video procurement expended for non revenue sharing titles  which generally have a higher purchase price than titles purchased under revenue sharing agreements 
additionally  the increase related to expenditures associated with the opening of seven new superstores and the expansion or remodel of nine superstores during fiscal compared to the opening of five new superstores and the expansion or remodel of seven superstores during fiscal and an increase in information systems expenditures to install new and upgraded hardware and software systems 
our capital expenditures include store equipment and fixtures  expanding and remodeling existing superstores  upgrading and implementation of information systems technology and the purchase of rental video assets 
financing activities 
cash provided by or used in financing activities is primarily associated with borrowings and payments made under our revolving credit facility defined below under capital structure 
cash provided by financing activities increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher net borrowings of approximately million under our revolving credit facility for fiscal compared to fiscal and lower stock repurchase activity of approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal on september  we announced a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
as of january   a total of approximately  shares had been purchased at a cost of approximately million  for an average cost of per share 
capital structure 
on august   we executed an amendment to our syndicated secured loan and security agreement with fleet retail finance  inc and the cit group business credit  inc  the facility 
the amount outstanding under the facility is limited by a borrowing base predicated on eligible inventory  as defined  and certain rental video assets  net of accumulated depreciation less specifically defined reserves and is limited to a ceiling of million  less a million availability reserve 
the facility s interest rate is based on the prevailing prime rate or libor plus a margin percentage  at our option 
the borrowing base under the facility is limited to an advance rate of of eligible inventory and certain rental video assets net of accumulated amortization less specifically defined reserves  which can be adjusted to reduce availability under the facility 
the facility contains no financial covenants  restricts the payment of dividends and includes certain other debt and acquisition limitations  allows for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock and requires a minimum availability of million at all times 
the facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and our subsidiaries and is guaranteed by each of our three consolidated subsidiaries 
the facility matures on august  at january   we had million in excess availability  after the million availability reserve  under the facility 
at january  and january   respectively  we had borrowings outstanding of million and million under the facility 
the average rate of interest being charged under the facility was and at january  and january   respectively 
from time to time  we enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to obtain a fixed interest rate on a portion of our outstanding floating rate debt thereby reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility 
on october   we cancelled  at no cost  two swap agreements entered into in november and december of with an aggregate notional amount of million and replaced those agreements with one interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution 
the notional amount of the swap is million with a fixed interest rate of for two years 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a hedging instrument 
at january   the fair value of the interest rate swap was not significant 
at january   our minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal were approximately million 
the present value of total existing minimum operating lease commitments for fiscal years through discounted at was approximately million as of january  seasonality and inflation as is the case with many retailers  a significant portion of our revenues  and an even greater portion of our operating profit  is generated in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the christmas selling season 
as a result  a substantial portion of our annual earnings has been  and will continue to be  dependent on the results of this quarter 
we experience reduced rentals of video activity in the spring because customers spend more time outdoors 
major world or sporting events  such as the war in iraq  the super bowl  the olympic games or the world series  also have a temporary adverse effect on revenues 
future operating results may be affected by many factors  including variations in the number and timing of superstore openings  the number and popularity of new book  music and videocassette titles  the cost of the new release or best renter titles  changes in comparable store revenues  competition  marketing programs  increases in the minimum wage  weather  special or unusual events  and other factors that may affect our operations 
we do not believe that inflation has materially impacted net income during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

this statement requires that the fair value of a liability associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 certain exit costs were recognized when we committed to a restructuring plan  which may have been before the liability was incurred 
the provisions of this statement were effective for exit or disposal activities initiated subsequent to december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the issue provides guidelines for specific treatment and classification of certain amounts received by a customer from a vendor in connection with product purchased from the vendor 
eitf is effective prospectively for new arrangements entered into after december  the provisions of eitf did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations as of  and for the year ended  january  we are analyzing the provisions of eitf for arrangements entered into for fiscal but have not yet determined the impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of variable rate debt based on the lenders base rate or libor plus a specified percentage at our option 
the annual impact on our results of operations of a basis point interest rate change on the january  outstanding balance of the variable rate debt would be approximately million  including the effect of our interest rate swap 
after an assessment of these risks to our operations  we believe that the primary market risk exposures within the meaning of regulation s k item are not material and are not expected to have any material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the next fiscal year 
in addition  we do not believe changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap entered into in october of with a notional amount of million will be material
