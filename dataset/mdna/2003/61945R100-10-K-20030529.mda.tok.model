in may  the company terminated agreements with acl and entered into new agreements with comcor  that  subject to stockholder approval  among other conditions  will result in cctv becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the company

the company retained ownership of jm ney s facility which it leases to the buyer of jm ney s operating assets under terms of an eight year lease which was negotiated in connection with the sale of jm ney s net assets 
due to the proposed acquisition of cctv  and the sale of jm ney  the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and the financial condition of the company will not be indicative of the company s expectations of its future results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  investments  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition investment income and other income is recognized when earned and is based on changes in the fair value of marketable securities and realized gains and losses 
rental income from the lease of jm ney s real estate is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the company to collect amounts due from others  including balances due from jm ney s former customers 
deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
when the company determines that it may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to estimated recoverable amounts is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  a reduction in the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
investment in moscow broadband the company records its investment in mbc using the equity method which also requires that the carrying value of the investment be evaluated for impairment 
prepaid pension expense the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pension plans which provides for the delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses that arise from differences between actual results of the plan from the actuarially calculated results based on several factors including employee mortality and turnover  investment return on plan assets and the discount rates used to record the present value of the obligations of the plan 
to the extent that unrecognized gains or losses exceed of the greater of the plans projected benefit obligation or the market value of its assets  such excess is amortized over the estimated remaining service period of active employees 
the company considers and adjusts the various assumptions  such as the discount rate  future compensation growth rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets  utilized in the calculations as market conditions warrant

this increase in cash and short term investments is expected to be invested in to cctv s operations to support its network build out and operations  as well as to meet the company s own operating and debt service requirements 
in may  the company entered into agreements under which it will acquire of the equity interests of cctv 
pursuant to these agreements  the company committed to investing million into cctv within days of the signing of the agreements 
subject to shareholder approval  the acquisition is proposed to be effected through the issuance of the company s common stock in exchange for the investment in cctv held by comcor  including additional equity in cctv to be acquired by comcor in exchange for both the extinguishment of liabilities from cctv to comcor as of december  and for the estimated value of services to be provided by comcor to cctv during and through the acquisition of the of mbc not presently owned by the company

if such contributions are not made  then the company will be obligated to issue up to  additional shares of its common stock to comcor 
the company does not expect to have sufficient resources to meet the full amount of the funding needed to be made to avoid this dilution  although it expects to contribute loans and advances from mbc to cctv and additional shares of ias presently owned by mbc  once it acquires mbc as part of the proposed transaction which would reduce the number of shares to common stock that the company would be obligated to issue to comcor  in the absence of any other contribution made by the company to cctv from  to an estimated  accordingly  the company expects to either raise capital through the issuance of its common stock to meet some or all of the funding requirement  or to issue some amount of shares of its common stock to comcor as a result of a potential funding shortfall 
except for rental income from the lease of jm ney s manufacturing facility  the company has limited sources of incoming cash to meet its operating expense and debt service requirements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the existing resources  including the planned proceeds from a  mortgage loan on the jm ney property which is expected to close in june  will be sufficient to meet these requirements  or the funding requirements of the cctv acquisition agreements or other cash needs that cctv may have in the future 
a condition of the sale of jm ney s operating assets required that  of the proceeds be held in escrow until september to settle any potential claim relating to the company s representations and warranties to the buyer of the assets  and to address payment for certain components of the inventory specifically identified by the parties 
although the company expects to realize a significant portion of the escrowed funds  there can be no assurances as to the amount  if any  of funds it will receive at the termination of the escrow period 
cctv currently is dependent upon outside sources of cash 
the company expects that the cash it will provide to cctv as required in the may agreements  and may in the future provide cctv  together with the settlement of certain of cctv s present and future obligations to comcor through their conversion into cctv equity and  at the closing of the proposed acquisition into shares of company common stock  and expected increases in revenue from cctv s operations will be sufficient to meet cctv s operating requirements for the foreseeable future  although there can be no assurances that these expectations will be met

at february   the recorded value of the prepaid expense relating to this plan was  or  lower than the prior year s amount 
under the actuarial calculations  the plan is overfunded by  a decrease of  from the prior year 
in accordance with sfas  the company has not recognized net actuarial losses and post service costs totaling  such losses have arisen from changes in the actuarially assumed discount rate to value the plan s obligations  and from investment performance in the most recent year which did not meet the actuarially assumed levels 
during the fiscal year ending february   the company expects to amortize approximately  of these unrecognized losses into its results of operations as part of overall pension accounting  although there cannot be any assurances that further actuarial losses will not occur during that period

foreign investment risk the company s investment in mbc and its subsequent direct investment into cctv are subject to currency fluctuations  illiquid markets and political risks associated with russia 
the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge the risks associated with these investments 
these investments also bear the risk of cctv s ability to increase its revenues through the addition of subscribers for its cable television  high speed data transmission and internet services 
the subscriber growth is largely dependent upon cctv s ability to build out its access network from the mfon which it leases from comcor  which is largely dependent upon it receiving a sufficient amount of capital to pay for the equipment and construction costs 
equity risk at february   the company held common stocks totaling  most of which are the stocks of financial institutions 
the company bears the risk of the fluctuations of the market prices of these companies 
interest rate risk at february   the company had no variable rate financing arrangements  and accordingly  its exposure to interest rate risk was limited to the interest rates it receives on its invested cash  a substantial portion of which has since been invested into cctv
