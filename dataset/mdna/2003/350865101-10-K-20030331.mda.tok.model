item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands of dollars unless otherwise specified general the company receives revenues from a number of sources  principally licensing  advertising media and broadcast and television and film production distribution 
beginning in september  the company began to recognize revenue from the sale of advertising time related to its lease of the fox saturday morning television block more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company typically derives a substantial portion of its licensing revenues from a small number of properties  which properties usually generate revenues only for a limited period of time 
because the company s licensing revenues are highly subject to the changing trends in the toy  game and entertainment business  its licensing revenues from year to year from particular sources are subject to dramatic increases and decreases 
it is not possible to precisely anticipate the length of time a property will be commercially successful  if at all 
popularity of properties can vary from months to years 
as a result  the company s revenues and net income may fluctuate significantly between comparable periods 
the company s licensing revenues have historically been primarily derived from the license of toy and game concepts 
thus  a substantial portion of the company s revenues and net income are subject to the seasonal variations of the toy and game industry 
typically  a majority of toy orders are shipped in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  the company s media buying subsidiary provides media services to a significant number of toy and video game companies and the company s advertising sales subsidiary sells advertising time where revenues will be higher in the fourth quarter commensurate with the demand for commercial time by children s advertisers for the holiday season 
as a result  much of their revenues are earned in the fourth quarter when the majority of toy and video game advertising occurs 
in the company s usual experience  its revenues during the second half of the year have generally been greater than during the first half of the year 
however  the company s revenues in the most recent fiscal years were influenced more by popularity trends and movie and home video release dates of yu gi oh and pokemon and advertising revenue derived from the sale of commercial time in the fox box which commenced operations in  than the historical seasonal trends of toy and game sales 
further  guarantee and minimum royalty payments may occur throughout the year  some of which are recognized as revenue upon the execution and delivery of license agreements 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could result in the company reporting financial results that differ significantly from the estimates previously used by the company which were based on different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which require managements most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this annual report filing 
below is a summary of the most significant of these policies 
revenue recognition merchandise licensing revenues are recognized when the underlying royalties from the sales of the related products are earned 
the company recognizes guaranteed royalties at the time the arrangement becomes effective if the company has no significant direct continuing involvement with the underlying property or obligation to the licensee 
where the company has significant continuing direct involvement with the underlying property or obligation to the licensee  guaranteed minimum royalties are recognized ratably over the term of the license or based on sales of the related products  if greater 
licensing advances and guaranteed payments collected  but not yet earned by the company are classified as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
broadcast advertising revenues are recognized when the related commercials are aired and are recorded net of agency commissions and an appropriate reserve when advertising is sold together with a guaranteed audience delivery 
internet advertising revenues are recognized on the basis of impression views in the period the advertising is displayed 
fee based commissions for media planning and buying services  for clients in both print and broadcast media  are recognized at the time the related media runs 
episodic television series initially produced for networks and first run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and foreign markets concurrently 
the length of the revenue cycle for episodic television varies depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production 
revenues arising from television license agreements are recognized in the period that the films or episodic television series are available for telecast 
production and adaptation costs reimbursed or charged to the licensor are included in net revenue and the corresponding costs are included in production service costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
revenues from home video and dvd sales  net of a reserve for returns  are recognized on the date that video and dvd units are shipped by our distributor to wholesalers retailers 
consistent with the practice in the home video industry  the company estimates the reserve for returns based upon its review of historical returns rates and expected future performance 
revenues from music sales  net of a reserve for returns  are recognized on the date units are shipped by the company s distributor to wholesalers retailers 
in the case of musical performance revenues  the revenue is recognized when the musical recordings are broadcast or performed 
film and television costs effective january   the company adopted aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting by producers or distributors of films 
sop established new accounting standards for producers and distributors of films  which resulted in changes in revenue recognition and accounting for exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing expenses and development and overhead costs 
the adoption of sop did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company capitalizes and amortizes the cost of production  including overhead  participations and talent residuals  for television programming using the individual film forecast method under which such costs are amortized for each television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such program bears to management s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such program 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization applicable to such title and or a write down of the value of such title to estimated fair value 
these revisions can result in significant quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in film write downs and rates of amortization 
if a total net loss is projected for a particular title  the associated film and television costs are written down to estimated fair value 
effective january   all exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing costs  are expensed as incurred 
television adaptation and production costs that are adapted and or produced are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
fox broadcast agreement in january  the company entered into a multi year agreement with fox to lease its television network s saturday morning programming block 
the company is providing all programming content for the fox box and commenced doing so with the september broadcast year 
the agreement has an initial term of four broadcast years  with the company having the option to extend the term for up to two additional broadcast years 
kids will pay a fee of  for each broadcast year during the initial term of the agreement 
the agreement provided for of the fee for the first broadcast season to be paid within ten days of the execution of the short form agreement in february   with the balance of the fee for the first broadcast season to be paid in four equal installments in the following september  december  february and april of the broadcast year 
all payments required to be paid on or prior to march  have been made 
the cost of the fox box has been and will be capitalized and amortized over the broadcast season based on estimated advertising revenue 
during  the company paid fox and certain affiliates a total of  representing a portion of the first year fees of which  was amortized as of december  the remaining  representing the unamortized portion of the first broadcast season s fee paid is included in prepaid fox broadcast fee on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  fees for each subsequent broadcast year are payable in the june preceding the beginning of the broadcast year which is september with the balance of the fee for the broadcast year payable in four equal installments in the following september  december  february and april 
additionally  the agreement required the company to establish a  letter of credit for the benefit of fox  which letter of credit may be reduced by the company as installments of the final year s fee are paid 
as of december   the company had received a commitment for the letter of credit  but the letter of credit has not been issued pending completion of the long form agreement with fox 
upon the issuance of the letter of credit  the company will grant a security interest in its cash balances to the issuing bank to secure the amount of such letter of credit and will appropriately disclose these amounts as restricted cash in its financial statements 
the agreement further provides that  at the company s option  up to  of each year s fee may be paid by delivering shares of the company s common stock 
over the initial four year term of the agreement  the company will pay fox an aggregate fee of  further  the company will incur additional costs to program the four hour block and to sell the related network advertising time 
these costs will include direct programming costs to acquire  adapt and deliver programming for broadcast during the weekly four hour block as well as additional indirect costs of advertising sales  promotion and administration 
the company s ability to recover the cost of its fees payable to fox will depend on the popularity of the television programs the company broadcasts on the fox box and the general market demand and pricing of advertising time for saturday morning children s broadcast television 
the popularity of such programs impacts audience levels and the level of the network advertising rates that the company can charge 
additionally  the success of merchandise licensing programs and home video sales based on such television programs broadcast on the fox box is dependent on consumer acceptance of the properties 
if the company estimates that it will be unable to generate sufficient future revenue from advertising sales  home video sales and merchandising licensing at levels to cover the cost of its contractual obligation to fox  the company would record a charge to earnings to reflect an expected loss on the fox agreement in the period in which the deficiency or factors affecting the recoverability of the fee payable become known 
the company will be required to make certain assumptions and estimates about future events such as advertising rates  audience viewing levels and licensing revenue in evaluating its ability to recover the cost of the fox fee 
such estimates and assumptions are subject to market forces and factors beyond the control of the company and are inherently subject to change 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover the full cost of the fox fee and in the event it cannot  it would record the resulting charge to earnings to reflect an expected loss on the fox fee  which could be significant
