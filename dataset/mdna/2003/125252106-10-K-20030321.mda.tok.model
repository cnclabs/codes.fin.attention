the note currently is callable  at premiums starting at of face value and declining thereafter 
in addition  the note is callable if the company s stock price exceeds of the conversion price for twenty consecutive days 
the company s stock price since the date of issuance of the debt has been below the conversion price and no beneficial conversion feature existed at the date of issuance

the company believes that the net cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the credit facility are sufficient to finance the company s operations through additionally  the company historically has obtained financing on normal commercial terms to fund acquisitions and major equipment purchases  and anticipates it will be able to continue to do so in the future if opportunities or needs arise 
seasonality and impact of inflation historically  the company has experienced lower net sales levels during the fourth quarter and increased net sales levels during the following first quarter 
this has been primarily due to year end depletion of inventory levels by the company s customers and due to the holidays at the end of the year  as the company s customers have an increased number of holiday plant closings 
in addition  fourth quarter pharmaceutical product sales generally are lower as a result of the postponement of elective surgeries during holiday periods 
in previous years  sales of fourth quarter printed products for use in the ready to assemble furniture market have been generally greater than third quarter sales in each of the previous years 
however beginning in  due to the new gift card business  the sales in the fourth quarter were much stronger 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company also added new customers  which generated increased sales more then offsetting historical trends 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s net sales or income to date 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
sfas  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on the financial statements 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for i intangible assets at acquisition and ii for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to their acquisition 
the company s goodwill and intangible assets relate to business acquisitions  and the purchase of production processes and worldwide marketing rights related to holography and the company s holographic products 
the following are the major classes and useful lives of the company s intangible assets as of december  and accum accum ulated net ulated net amorti book amorti book useful cost zation value cost zation value lives years pre n a goodwill       holo graphic base coat processes       years worldwide holographic rights       years total     in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal  management initially assessed the useful economic life for its holographic base coat process and worldwide holographic rights to have an indefinite life 
however  during the third quarter  the company concluded that amortization should continue to be recorded for those assets under sfas no 
as a result  in the third quarter of the company recorded amortization of  or  net of income taxes  and has continued to record amortization over the remaining useful life 
the company filed amended form q as for each of the quarters ended march  and june  to reflect the amortization  in each quarter of these intangibles 
other than the change in the amortization life of goodwill from years to indefinite  no other useful lives of intangibles were changed in connection with the adoption of sfas no

in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has not provided any guarantees that falls within the scope of this pronouncement and therefore does not believe that it will have any impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company intends to continue with its existing accounting policy and therefore this pronouncement will not have any impact 
special note on forward looking statements the company believes that certain statements contained in this report and in the future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission and in the company s written and oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer that are not historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby 
the words and phrases looking ahead  is confident  should be  will  predicted  believe  plan  intend  estimates  likely  expect and anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance  but are subject to many uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and business environment which may affect the accuracy of forward looking statements and cause the actual results of the company to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
as a result  in some future quarter the company s operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of the company s common stock would likely be materially and adversely affected 
many of the factors that will determine results of operations are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include o the effect of continuing unfavorable economic conditions on market growth trends in general and the impact on the company s customers  the demand for the company s products and services  and the company s ordinary sources of supply in particular  o risks inherent in international operations  including possible economic  political or monetary instability and its impact on the level and profitability of foreign sales  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to consummate its business strategy  including the unavailability of suitable acquisition candidates  or the company s inability to finance future acquisitions or successfully realize synergies and cost savings from the integration of acquired businesses  o changes in the costs and availability of raw materials and the company s ability to adjust selling prices to reflect those changes  o the company s reliance on existing senior management and the impact of the loss of any of those persons or its inability to continue to identify  hire and retain qualified management personnel  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to develop and distribute new proprietary products to respond to market needs in a timely manner and the company s ability to continue to protect its proprietary product information and technology  o the company s ability to continue to successfully identify and implement productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives  o the company s reliance on a small number of significant customers  o uncertainties relating to the company s ability to continue to compete effectively with other producers of specialty transferable coatings and producers of alternative products with greater financial and management resources  o control of the company by a principal stockholder  and o the effects of acts of terrorism and armed conflicts on the company s operations  demands for products and sources of supply 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the company to predict all such risk factors  nor can the company assess the impacts of all such risk factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
the company has no obligation to revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after february  or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated events 
investors should also be aware that while the company does  from time to time  communicate with securities analysts  it is against the company s policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that the company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not the company s responsibility 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments to address interest rate  currency  or commodity pricing risks 
the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments held by the company for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments 
the estimated fair value of accounts receivable approximated its carrying value at december  and based upon analysis of their collectability and net realizable value 
the estimated fair value of the company s long term debt approximated its carrying value at december  and december   based upon market prices for the same or similar type of financial instrument 
the company minimizes its exposure to the impact of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in situations for certain sales for products sold in europe but manufactured in the us through the movement of production of those products to europe 
there are no other activities of the company where management believes exchange rates have a material impact with respect to the underlying transactions 
beginning in january  the company renewed its main loan agreements 
the two main domestic loans  term loan a and term loan b see note to the financial statement beginning on page for more details were renewed at a floating prime rate of interest with a one time option to a fixed rate of interest 
based on the company s floating rate loans  a change in the interest rate of one percent would equate to a change of  of interest on an annual basis 
interest expense the company s exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the composition of its debt instruments which consist of fixed and variable rate instruments 
variable rate debt instruments can also be converted to a fixed rate should interest rates rise in the future 
euro conversion member countries of the european union have established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies legacy currencies and one common currency  the euro 
since january   the new euro denominated notes and coins are in circulation and legacy currencies have been withdrawn from circulation 
the company has a manufacturing facility located in a member country germany  and the conversion to the euro has eliminated currency exchange rate risk for transactions among the member countries  which for the company primarily consists of payments to suppliers 
in addition  because the company uses foreign denominated debt to meet its financial requirements and to reduce its foreign currency risks  certain of these financial instruments are denominated in euro to finance european activities 
the company addressed all issues involved with converting to the new currency  and the conversion did not have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   the company had total assets of million and net assets of million invested in europe
