 if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
once the impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the goodwill will be its new accounting basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and each of the mexican peso  canadian dollar  euro  and indian rupee 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
the company s financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity the company has operations in several foreign countries  and approximately million of the company s revenue from continuing operations was derived from the company s operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
the company does not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between company subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
the company does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact report net earnings loss by approximately  interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate payable on the company s facility is influenced by the actions of the federal reserve bank board in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate which is the rate banks borrow from the federal reserve bank 
during and the federal reserve implemented a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy 
as a result the effective interest rate that the company paid on its borrowings under the facility declined leading to a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
to the extent that the federal reserve increases the federal funds interest rate in the future  the effective interest rate on the company s facility will increase 
the company s interest expense will increase accordingly if borrowing levels remain constant 
based on the balance outstanding under our facility at year end  a change in the effective interest rate would have changed interest expense by
