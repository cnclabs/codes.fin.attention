item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the three years ended december  it should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto and other financial and operating information included in this form k 
overview the company offers products and services to patients  providers  and payers in the fertility industry 
the integramed network is comprised of twenty two fertility centers in major markets across the united states  a pharmaceutical subsidiary  a financing subsidiary  the council of physicians and scientists and a leading fertility portal www 
integramed 
com 
sixteen fertility centers have access to the company s fertilitydirect program 
six of the fertility centers are designated as fertilitypartners and as such  have access to the company s fertilitydirect program in addition to being provided with a full range of services including i administrative services  including accounting and finance  human resource functions  and purchasing of supplies and equipment  ii access to capital and servicing and financing patient accounts receivable  iii marketing and sales  iv integrated information systems  and v assistance in identifying best clinical practices 
the company s strategy is to align information  technology and finance for the benefit of fertility patients  providers  and payers 
the primary elements of the company s strategy include i expanding the integramed provider network into new major markets  ii increasing the number and value of service packages purchased by fertility centers that are members of the integramed provider network  iii entering in to additional fertilitypartners tm contracts  iv increasing revenues at fertilitypartners centers  v increasing the number of shared risk refund treatment packages sold to patients of contracted fertility centers and managing the risk associated with the shared risk refund program  vi increasing sales of pharmaceutical products and services  and vii developing internet based access to personalized health information 
in september  the company obtained from fleet bank  na a million credit facility to fund acquisitions to provide working capital and to refinance its existing bank debt 
in september  the company elected not to renew a portion of this credit facility related to potential acquisitions  as management believes that internal sources of funds will be sufficient to finance any future acquisitions 
the company renewed the working capital and term loan components of this facility  which totaled approximately million 
in december  the company s agreement with the st 
barnabas medical center based fertility center was terminated early 
the company received million in liquidated damages pursuant to an early termination agreement 
these funds were recorded as revenue by the company during as compensation for certain performance obligations contained in the termination agreement 
during  the company negotiated revised fee structures for all five of its then existing major fertilitypartners contracts 
on four of these contracts in which service fees are comprised of a a tiered percentage of revenue  b a fixed percentage of fertility center earnings and c reimbursed cost of services 
the company negotiated lower percentages on the revenue and fertility center earnings components 
these lower fees are to be phased in over an approximate five year period 
the company believes that this revised fee structure will be more than offset by growth in the underlying fertility centers  and will in turn result in growth in the company s aggregate revenues 
on the remaining fertilitypartners contract  the company negotiated higher service fees  which are assessed at a fixed amount each month independent of the fertility center s underlying revenue or earnings 
on april   the company signed a fertilitypartners agreement with the margate  florida based northwest center for infertility and reproductive endocrinology ncire 
under the terms of the year agreement  the company s service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of ncire earnings 
the company has budgeted up to million to fund the development and equipping of a new state of the art facility to house the clinical practice and embryology laboratory for ncire and its patients 
on july   the company completed a private placement of  shares of its common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds of  the warrants become exercisable commencing january  and will expire on january  additionally  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share were issued to the underwriter in connection with the private placement 
these warrants become exercisable july  and will expire on july  on november   the company announced the ending of its fertilitypartners agreement with rsa of new york 
the agreement is to end on november  rsa of new york serves the long island market and revenues for the four quarterly periods ending prior to the announcement were million 
the program had a contribution of  for the same period 
at the time of the announcement  the company evaluated its exclusive business rights asset associated with rsa of new york and reduced that asset to its realizable value by adjusting the asset downward by  critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following accounting policies fit this definition basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated 
the company principally derives its revenues from fertilitypartners contracts and the sale of pharmaceutical products 
the company does not have a controlling financial interest in any of the medical practices and as such does not consolidate their results 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue and cost recognition fertilitypartners service fees as of december   the company provided comprehensive services to fertility centers under six fertilitypartners contracts 
under five of the current agreements  the company receives as compensation for its services a three part fee comprised of i a tiered percentage of net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a fertility center and any costs paid on behalf of the fertility center and iii a fixed percentage of earnings after services fees 
under the sixth agreement  as compensation for its services  the company receives a fixed fee plus reimbursed costs of services 
all revenues from fertilitypartners service fees are recorded in the period services are rendered 
direct costs incurred by the company in performing its services and costs incurred on behalf of the medical practices are reported as costs of services 
revenue and costs are recognized in the same period in which the related services have been performed 
pharmaceutical sales the company distributes fertility related pharmaceutical products through ipsi 
the company has a servicing arrangement with ivpcare  inc  to fulfill the purchase and distribution of pharmaceuticals 
ipsi accepts patient orders  verifies patient insurance coverage where applicable and ships prescription based pharmaceuticals directly to patients of certain affiliated fertility centers 
revenue is derived from the sales of these pharmaceuticals and is recorded  along with the related costs including the fee due ivpcare  when shipments are made 
the cost of pharmaceutical products purchased is recorded as a cost of sales and is not offset against revenues 
pharmaceutical sales accounts receivable represent receivables held by ipsi for medications sold directly to patients 
risk of loss in connection with uncollectibility of these accounts receivable is borne by the company 
shared risk refund program the shared risk refund program was established at shady grove  the leading fertility center in the metropolitan washington  dc area and a member of the integramed provider network 
based on the experience at shady grove  the company developed an actuarial model that allows pricing a treatment package to consumers 
the shared risk refund program consists of a package that includes up to three cycles of in vitro fertilization for one fixed price with a significant refund if the patient does not deliver a baby 
under this innovative financial program  the company receives payment directly from consumers who qualify for the program and pays contracted fertility centers a defined reimbursement for each treatment cycle performed 
expenses related to the program are recorded as incurred 
potentially refundable revenues are deferred until the pregnancy outcome is determined 
the company manages the risk associated with the shared risk refund program through a case management program 
this case management program authorizes patient care and provides information to be used in recognizing revenue 
a reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss is maintained and based on historical averages of pregnancy losses applied to the revenues recorded within the applicable periods 
actual results relating to the recording of revenue  expenses and refunds to date have not varied materially from the estimates used in the actuarial model 
due from medical practices due from medical practices represents the net amounts owed to us by the medical practices for our share of the medical providers earnings  our fertilitypartners service fees and reimbursement of practice expenses  net of the company s advances to the medical practices for the financing of their patient accounts receivable 
due from medical practices excludes amounts owed by the company to medical practices for acquired exclusive services rights since the financial accounting standards board interpretation conditions for offset are not met for these obligations 
such acquired rights are reported as intangible assets 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fas 
the income tax benefit provision is determined under the asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
the income tax benefit provision is the sum of the amount of income tax paid or payable for the year as determined by applying the provisions of enacted tax laws to the taxable income for that year and the net change during the year in the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
exclusive service rights exclusive service rights represent costs incurred by the company for the right to service certain fertility centers and are valued at cost less accumulated amortization  which is provided on a straight line basis over the length of the contract  usually ten to twenty five years 
the company periodically reviews exclusive business service rights to assess recoverability  any impairment would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations if a permanent impairment was determined to have occurred 
recoverability is determined based on undiscounted expected earnings from the related business over the remaining amortization period 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of net revenue represented by various expenses and other income items reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and revenues  net see note fertilitypartners service fees pharmaceutical sales other total revenues costs of services incurred fertilitypartners service fees pharmaceutical sales other total costs of services incurred contribution fertilitypartners sevice fees pharmaceutical sales other total contribution general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense total other expenses income from operations before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income a a excluding the effect of the adjustment related to reducing the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  net income as a percentage of net revenues would have been for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
calendar year compared to calendar year revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from the year ended the main factors contributing to this increase were i medical billings increased at the core fertilitypartners centers as a result of increased patient volume 
same center growth was over the prior year 
the volume increase was the result of intensified marketing initiatives  improved pregnancy rates for infertility treatment  and  in some cases  the addition of new physicians to the practice 
in addition  the fertilitypartners agreement signed with ncire in april  contributed approximately million of revenue for the year ended december  ii the company s pharmaceutical division experienced a increase in revenue 
this increase was driven by increases in patient volume at the integramed provider network  as well as increased participation and penetration of the pharmaceutical product line among the integramed provider network 
iii other revenues  comprised primarily of the company s shared risk refund program  increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the company anticipates that continued growth of this program  driven in part by focused marketing efforts  to become a significant component of its direct to consumer orientation 
contribution of million in remained unchanged from as a percentage of revenue  the contribution margin decreased to in from in the following factors contributed to the lack of change in contribution i as previously disclosed  the company s revised fee structure with five of its fertilitypartners contracts provides for reduced fees and margins on the incremental earnings of those centers 
during  while continued growth of the fertilitypartners contracts resulted in greater aggregate revenues for the company  several components of this revenue stream were at the lower contractual incremental margins 
ii the company s pharmaceutical sales  which grew by million  or  during the year ended december   have a margin of approximately  which is substantially below the margin of the company s other revenue components 
as the company s pharmaceutical segment continues to expand faster than the company s other product lines  the weighted impact will be an anticipated reduction in the company s margins 
iii during  the company adopted eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which required the company to report its revenue net of the amortization of its services rights 
while revenue for all years presented has been restated to reflect this change  results for include a  write down of service rights related to the mutual termination of the company s new york based fertilitypartners agreement 
iv as previously discussed  the company s agreement with the medical center based fertility center generated a payment for damages that was recorded in this approximately million payment had minor costs associated with it and the million resulted in gross contribution dollars in there was no similar payment in general and administrative expenses increased by million  to million in from million in this increase was mainly attributable to increasing costs associated with the company s efforts to expand the base of fertility centers participating in its fertilitydirect program and to support the growth of its shared risk refund product line 
interest expense declined from  for the year ended december  to  for as a result of scheduled debt reductions as well as declining interest rates as the company s debt carries interest at rates that use libor as a base 
interest income declined from  for the year ended december  to  in as a result of falling interest rates 
income tax provisions benefits were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the benefit was a result of reducing the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to sustained profitability over an extended period and the increased likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets 
there have been no current federal income tax payments due to the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards 
the company s effective tax rate for was approximately and reflects credits for the reversal of state taxes provided in prior periods 
the effective tax rate was approximately  excluding the effects of the change in the valuation allowance  and reflects credits for the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards not previously provided 
calendar year compared to calendar year revenues for increased by million  or  between the years ended and the main factors contributing to this increase were i revenues derived from the company s fertilitypartners agreements increased million  or  as a result of increased market growth at all network facilities  including in market mergers at the company s sites in the bay area and shady grove 
same market growth was achieved through new service offerings  the expansion of ancillary services and increases in patient volume 
ii revenues at the company s pharmaceutical division increased by million  or 
this increase is attributable to expanded penetration of this product line within the company s fertilitypartners centers 
contribution increased by million  or  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  the contribution margin decreased to in from in the following factors contributed to this change in contribution i contribution at the company s fertilitypartners centers increased by million  or  with margins remaining relatively constant at in versus in the growth in contribution was in line with revenue growth and site expansion activities discussed earlier 
ii pharmaceutical contribution increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to increased shipments to patients at the various fertility centers 
these sales have a lower margin than the principal line of the company s business and impact the contribution margin percentage negatively 
iii contribution in included million of costs associated with the company s start up investment in its shared risk refund product line 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  in from this increase was primarily due to increases in staffing  compensation  legal expenses  and expenses related to periodic infrastructure upgrades in management information systems 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in  up from in as a result of the above stated reasons 
interest expense declined from  for the year ended december  to  for as a result of scheduled debt reductions as well as declining interest rates as the company s debt carries interest at rates that use libor as a base 
interest income declined from  for the year ended december  to  in as a result of falling interest rates offset by higher amounts of funds available for overnight investment 
income taxes reflected a reduction of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance in  as the company has sustained profitability over an extended period and due to the likelihood of the realization of these tax assets 
primarily as a result of this reduction in the valuation allowance  a deferred federal tax benefit of approximately million was recorded  which offset the state tax provision of million 
during the year ended december   no federal deferred tax benefit was recognized and the tax provision of  was comprised entirely of state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital position was impacted by its investment of million in additional service rights as well as its million repurchase and retirement of all of its outstanding preferred stock 
these two outflows were partially offset by the  raised in the july private placement mentioned above 
the company s working capital decreased during to million as of december   from million as of december  working capital and specifically  cash and cash equivalents remain at adequate levels to fund the company s operations 
in september  the company amended its existing credit facility with fleet bank  na the amended facility is comprised of a million three year working capital revolver  and a continuance of the company s existing million year term loan  of which approximately million remained outstanding with a remaining term of approximately years as of the date of the amendment 
availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver are based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined therein 
in addition  the credit agreement contains restricted covenants 
due to the continued expansion of the fertilitypartners centers  the company exceeded the capital spending threshold as defined in one restrictive covenant during  and obtained the required waiver effective december  as of december   under the working capital revolver  there were no amounts outstanding and the full amount of million was available 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s assets 
the company is also continuously reviewing its credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary 
as of december   the company did not have any significant commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets  however it has budgeted upcoming capital expenditures of approximately million 
these expenditures are primarily related to expansion of the existing fertilitypartners centers 
the company believes that the cash flows from its existing operations  plus its existing credit facility will be sufficient to provide for its future liquidity needs 
significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years notes payable    capital lease obligations   operating leases      total contractual cash obligations      amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years after years lines of credit   total commercial commitments   the company also has commitments to provide accounts receivable financing under its fertilitypartners agreements 
the company s financing of this receivable occurs on the th of each month 
the medical practice s repayment priority consists of the following i reimbursement of expenses that the company has incurred on their behalf  ii payment of the fixed or  if applicable  the variable portion of the service fee which relates to the fertilitypartners revenues  and iii payment of the variable portion of the service fee 
the company is responsible for the collection of receivables  which are financed with full recourse 
the company has continuously funded these needs from cash flow from operations and the collection of the prior month s receivables 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  the company could draw on its existing working capital line of credit 
the company makes payments on behalf of the fertilitypartners for which it is reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  the company does not make other advances to the medical practice 
the company has no other funding commitments to the fertilitypartners 
new accounting standards financial accounting standards financial accounting standard fas rescinds the financial accounting standards board statement no

fas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate any inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
fas also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the company does not believe the adoption of fas will have an impact on its financial statements 
financial accounting standard financial accounting standard fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no

 applying apb opinions no 
and when a savings and loan association or a similar institution is acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method interpretation  provided interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method to acquisitions of financial institutions 
except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises  financial accounting standard fas removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both fas and interpretation and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with fas  business combinations  and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
thus  the requirement in paragraph of fas to recognize and subsequently amortize any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of this statement 
in addition  fas amends fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets 
consequently  those intangible assets are subject to the same undiscounted cash flow recoverability test and impairment loss recognition and measurement provisions that fas requires for other long lived assets that are held and used 
the company does not believe fas will have an impact on its financial statements

the prospective method  however  may no longer be applied for adoptions of the accounting provisions of fas for periods beginning after december b
