c narrative description of business cement  aggregate and concrete the cac business segment includes the manufacture and sale of cement  aggregates  ready mix concrete  concrete block and brick 
production and distribution facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california  with markets extending into contiguous states 
in addition  txi has certain patented and unpatented mining claims in southern california which contain deposits of limestone 
the company does not place heavy reliance on patents  franchises  licenses or concessions related to its cac operations

index to financial statements cement txi s cement operations produce gray portland cement as its principal product 
also produced are specialty cements such as white portland  masonry and oil well 
cement production facilities are located at four sites in texas and california midlothian  texas  south of dallas fort worth  the largest cement plant in texas  hunter  texas  south of austin  and oro grande and crestmore  california  both near los angeles 
except for the crestmore facility  the limestone reserves used as the primary raw material are located on fee owned property adjacent to each of the plants 
raw material for the crestmore facility is purchased from multiple outside suppliers 
information regarding each of the company s facilities is as follows plant rated annual productive capacity tons of clinker manufacturing process service date internally estimated minimum reserves years midlothian  tx dry wet hunter  tx dry oro grande  ca dry crestmore  ca dry n a total the company uses its patented cemstar sm process in both of its texas facilities and its oro grande  california facility to increase combined annual production by approximately 
the cemstar sm process adds slag  a co product of steel making  into a cement kiln along with the regular raw material feed 
the added slag serves to increase the production of clinker with little additional cost 
the primary fuel source for all of the company s facilities is coal  however  the company displaces approximately of its coal needs at its midlothian plant and approximately of its coal needs at its hunter plant by utilizing alternative fuels such as waste derived fuels and tires 
the company s facilities also consume large amounts of electricity obtained primarily under variable price firm supply contracts of short duration 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both fuel and electricity are readily available 
the company produced approximately million tons of finished cement in  million tons in and million tons in total annual shipments of finished cement were approximately million tons in  million tons in and million tons in  of which million tons in  million tons in and million tons in were shipped to outside trade customers 
the company purchased for resale large amounts of cement during fiscal years and to prepare the market for the midlothian  texas expansion 
the company markets its cement products in the southwestern united states 
the principal marketing area includes the states of texas  louisiana  oklahoma  california  nevada  arizona and utah 
sales offices are maintained throughout the marketing area and sales are made primarily to numerous customers in the construction industry  no one of which accounted for more than ten percent of the trade sales volume in cement is distributed by rail or truck to eight distribution terminals located throughout the marketing area 
the cement industry is highly competitive with suppliers differentiating themselves based on price  service and quality

operations started in august net sales of expanded shale and clay are included within cac other products 
reserves identified with the facilities shown above and additional reserves available to support future plant sites are contained on approximately  acres of land  of which approximately  acres are owned in fee and the remainder leased 
the expanded shale and clay plants operated at percent of rated annual productive capacity for with sales of approximately million cubic yards 
production for the remaining aggregate facilities during fiscal year was percent of rated annual productive capacity and sales for the year totaled million tons  of which approximately million tons were shipped to outside trade customers 
in addition  the company owns and operates three industrial sand plants and an aggregate blending facility 
the cost of transportation limits the marketing of these various aggregates to the areas within approximately one hundred miles of the plant sites 
consequently  sales of these products are related to the level of construction activity near these plants 
these products are marketed by the company s sales organization located in the areas served by the plants and are sold to numerous customers  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
the distribution of these products is provided to trade customers principally by contract or customer owned haulers  and a limited amount of these products is distributed by rail for affiliated usage

index to financial statements ready mix concrete the company s ready mix concrete operations are situated in three areas in texas dallas fort worth denton  houston and east texas  in north and central louisiana  and at one location in southern arkansas 
the following table summarizes various information concerning these facilities location number of plants number of trucks texas louisiana arkansas the plants listed above are located on sites owned or leased by the company 
txi manufactures and supplies a substantial amount of the cement and aggregates used by the ready mix plants with the remainder being purchased from outside suppliers 
ready mix concrete is sold to various contractors in the construction industry  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
other concrete and brick products the major concrete and brick products manufactured and marketed by the company are summarized below products locations prepackaged concrete and related products dallas fort worth  texas austin  texas cresson  texas houston  texas bossier city  louisiana concrete block alexandria  louisiana bossier city  louisiana monroe  louisiana clay brick athens  texas mineral wells  texas mooringsport  louisiana the plant or distribution sites in the above locations are owned by the company 
the products are marketed by the company s sales force in each of these locations  and are primarily delivered by trucks owned by the company 
because the cost of delivery is significant to the overall cost of most of these products  the market area is generally restricted to within approximately one hundred miles of the plant locations 
these products are sold to various contractors  owners and distributors  no one of which would be considered significant to the company s business 
in most of txi s principal markets for concrete products  the company competes vigorously with at least three other vertically integrated concrete companies 
the company believes that it is a significant participant in each of the texas and louisiana concrete products markets 
the principal methods of competition in concrete products markets are quality and service at competitive prices 

table of contents 
index to financial statements steel txi s steel facilities  located in midlothian  texas and dinwiddie county  virginia  produce a broader array of steel products than a traditional mini mill 
txi uses its patented near net shape casting technology at both facilities 
the process involves casting molten steel into a shape that is closer to a product s final shape than traditional casting methods 
this technology provides energy and capital cost savings in the making of wide flange beams and other structural steel products 
the texas facility has two electric arc furnaces with continuous casters that feed melted steel to a bar mill  a structural mill and a large beam mill 
finished rolled products produced include beams up to twenty four inches wide  merchant bar quality rounds  special bar quality rounds  reinforcing bar and channels 
the virginia facility has one electric arc furnace and in line processing units consisting of two near net shape casters and a sophisticated rolling mill 
finished products produced include beams up to thirty six inches wide  sheet piling  h piling and channels 
the rated annual capacities of the operating facilities are as follows rated annual productive capacity tons approximate facility square footage texas melting rolling virginia melting rolling the bar and structural mills produced approximately million tons of finished products in  million tons in and million tons in the principal raw material is recycled steel scrap 
shredded steel represents approximately of the raw material mix 
a major portion of the shredded steel requirements of the texas facility is produced by an on site shredder operation utilizing primarily crushed auto bodies purchased on the open market 
the company purchases shredded steel on the open market to meet the requirements of the virginia facility 
another grade of recycled steel scrap  heavy  representing approximately of the raw material mix is also purchased on the open market 
the purchase price of recycled steel scrap is subject to market forces largely beyond the company s control 
the supply of recycled steel scrap is expected to be adequate to meet future requirements 
steel mini mills consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas 
electricity for the texas facility is obtained from a local utility under variable price firm supply contracts typically of short duration 
electricity for the virginia facility is obtained from a local utility under an interruptible supply contract with price adjustments that reflect increases or decreases in the utility s fuel costs 
natural gas is obtained from local gas utilities under supply contracts 
the company believes that adequate supplies of both electricity and natural gas are readily available 
the company s steel products are marketed by the company s sales organization throughout the united states and to a limited extent in canada and mexico 
sales are primarily to steel service centers and steel fabricators for use in the construction industry  as well as to cold finishers  forgers and original equipment manufacturers for use in the railroad  defense  automotive  mobile home and energy industries 
the company does not place heavy reliance on franchises  licenses or concessions 
none of txi s customers accounted for more than ten percent of the steel segment s sales in sales to affiliates are minimal 
orders are generally filled within days and are cancelable 
delivery of finished products is accomplished by common carrier  customer owned trucks  rail or barge 
the company competes with steel producers  including foreign producers  on the basis of price  quality and service 
certain of the foreign and domestic competitors  including both large integrated steel producers and mini mills  have substantially greater assets and larger sales organizations than txi 
intense sales competition exists for substantially all of txi s steel products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements risks relating to the company competition all of the markets in which the company participates are highly competitive 
the company competes in each of its cement  aggregate and concrete products markets with several other domestic suppliers of these products as well as with importers of foreign cement 
the company competes in its steel markets with national and international producers of steel products 
some of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less financial leverage than the company 
the company competes on the basis of  among other things  competitive prices  prompt availability  customer service and quality products 
excess world steel capacity resulting from the construction of new mini mills  expansion and improved production by integrated mills and substantial expansion of foreign steel capacity together with lower demand for us steel continues to adversely impact the us steel market 
sensitivity to economic cycles  seasonality and weather a significant percentage of the company s sales of both cac and steel products is attributable to the level of construction activity  which is affected by such cyclical factors as general economic conditions  availability of public funds  interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits and employment 
the company s cac operating profit is generally lower in its fiscal quarter ended february as compared to the other three fiscal quarters due to the impact of winter weather on construction activity 
extended periods of inclement weather can adversely impact construction activity at other times of the year as well 
steel results are also affected by the company s shut downs scheduled every twelve to twenty four months to refurbish its steel production facilities 
growth strategy a significant element of the company s operating strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions that either expand or complement the company s products or markets or to build new or expand existing production facilities 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms  that the company will be able to obtain the permits necessary to build new or expand existing production facilities  that the company will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions or expansions on acceptable terms or that the company will be able successfully to integrate such acquisitions into existing operations 
availability and pricing of raw materials and energy the company is dependent upon purchased recycled scrap steel as a raw material and upon the availability of energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
accordingly  the company s results of operations and financial condition have in the past been  and may again in the future be adversely affected by increases in raw material costs or energy costs  or their lack of availability 
status of certain tariffs cac segment 
a group of domestic cement producers  including the company  filed antidumping petitions that have resulted in the imposition of significant antidumping duty cash deposits on grey portland cement and clinker imported from mexico and japan 
in addition  the us department of commerce has signed agreements with the venezuelan government and venezuelan cement producers  which are designed to eliminate the dumping and illegal subsidization of grey portland cement and clinker from venezuela 
on an annual basis  the antidumping duties are subject to review by the department of commerce to determine whether the current antidumping duty deposit rates should be adjusted upward or downward 
a substantial reduction or elimination of the existing antidumping duties could lower the company s results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in  the antidumping code of general agreement on tariffs and trade was substantially altered pursuant to the uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations 
us legislation approving and implementing the uruguay round agreements requires the department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc to conduct sunset reviews of all outstanding antidumping and countervailing duty orders and suspension agreements  including the antidumping orders against grey portland cement and clinker from mexico and japan and the suspension agreements on grey portland cement and clinker from venezuela  to determine whether they should be terminated or remain in effect 
in  the department of commerce and the itc conducted sunset reviews of the antidumping orders and suspension agreements and determined that they should remain in effect until when the itc is scheduled to conduct another sunset review 
however  the itc determined that the suspension agreements with venezuela were no longer necessary 
mexican cement producers have appealed the itc sunset determination regarding imports from mexico to a dispute panel established under the north american free trade agreement 
the government of mexico has also requested consultations with the united states regarding the mexican cement antidumping order under world trade organization wto dispute settlement rules 
the consultations could lead to mexico filing a wto complaint challenging the department of commerce s and the itc s determinations in sunset reviews and the annual determination of the amount of duties 
in addition  the government of mexico has filed a request with the wto to form a dispute resolution panel regarding the united states antidumping order on mexican cement 
the exact schedule of the wto preceding is not yet established 
domestic cement producers have appealed the itc sunset review determinations regarding imports from venezuela to the us court of international trade 
although to date venezuelan imports have not competed in the company s markets to any significant degree  they may do so in the future 
while the average cost of imported cement rose during  the cost of cement imports from some countries  particularly those from southeast asia  are less 
moreover  independently owned cement operations could undertake to construct new import facilities and begin to purchase large quantities of low priced cement from countries not yet subject to antidumping orders  such as those in asia  which could not compete with domestic producers 
an influx of low priced cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders could lower the company s results of operations 
steel segment 
excessive imports of steel into the united states have in recent years  and may again in the future  exert downward pressure on us steel prices and significantly reduce the company s sales  margins and profitability 
competition from foreign producers has greatly increased as a result of excess foreign steel making capacity and a weakening of certain foreign economies  particularly in eastern europe  asia and latin america 
in addition  the company believes the downward pressure on  and depressed levels of  us steel prices in recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers 
some foreign steel producers are owned  controlled or subsidized by foreign governments 
as a result  decisions by these producers with respect to their production  sales and pricing are often influenced to a greater degree by political and economic policy considerations than by prevailing market conditions  realities of the marketplace or consideration of profit or loss 
in july  complaints were filed with the itc and the us department of commerce by the company  northwestern steel wire co  nucor yamato steel co 
and the united steelworkers of america seeking to impose antidumping and countervailing duties against imports of structural steel beams from germany  japan  south korea and spain 
in june and july  the itc made respective determinations that an industry in the united states is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of such imports from japan and korea that the department of commerce has determined are subsidized and sold in the united states at less than fair value 
as a result of the itc s affirmative determinations  the department of commerce directed the us customs service to impose countervailing and antidumping duties on imports of certain structural steel beams from these two countries 
however  imports of structural steel beams from other countries increased significantly and the committee for fair beam imports composed of northwestern steel wire co  nucor corp  nucor yamato steel co 
and the company again petitioned the itc and the u 
s 
department of commerce concerning imports of certain structural steel beams from china  germany  luxembourg  russia  south africa  spain and taiwan 
on june   the itc determined that  although the department of commerce had determined that these imports were being sold in the united states at less than fair value  such imports did not materially injure or threaten with material injury an industry in the united states  and no antidumping duties were imposed on imports of structural steel beams from these countries 
the committee for fair beam imports has appealed the itc s negative determination 
existing duties are subject to annual review upon request 
a substantial reduction or elimination of the existing antidumping duties  or an influx of low priced steel products from countries not subject to antidumping orders  could again create downward pressure on us steel prices and  in turn  lower the company s results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements impact of environmental laws the company s operations and those of its subsidiaries are subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the generation  use  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  and provide for the investigation and remediation of contamination existing at current and former properties  and at third party waste disposal sites 
they have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
as with others in its business  the company expends substantial amounts to comply with these laws and regulations  including amounts for pollution control equipment required to monitor and regulate wastewater discharges and air emissions 
the us environmental protection agency epa and state agencies are charged with enforcing these laws and regulations  and these agencies can impose substantial fines and penalties  as well as curtail and or suspend the company s operations  for violations and non compliance 
moreover  certain of these laws and regulations permit private parties to bring actions against the company for injuries to persons and damages to property allegedly caused by its operations 
changes in environmental laws may interrupt production  increase the cost of compliance and hinder the company s ability to build new or expand production facilities 
emissions sources at the company s facilities are regulated by a combination of permit limitations and emission standards of national and statewide application 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with its permit limitations and emission standards and regulations applicable to its existing facilities 
future changes in permit limitations and emission standards  however  may result in prolonged production interruption  significant costs of compliance or a hindrance of ability to build new or expand existing production facilities 
many of the raw materials  products and by products associated with the operation of any industrial facility  including those for the production of steel  cement or concrete products  contain chemical elements or compounds that can be designated as hazardous 
such raw materials  products and by products may also exhibit characteristics that result in their being classified as a hazardous substance or waste 
some examples are the metals present in cement kiln dust ckd  electric arc furnace dust eaf dust generated by the company s steel facilities and the ignitability of the waste derived fuels that the company uses as a primary or supplementary fuel substitute for nonrenewable coal and natural gas to fire certain of its cement kilns 
currently  ckd is exempt from hazardous waste management standards under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra if certain tests are satisfied 
the company has demonstrated that the ckd it generates satisfies these tests 
however  the epa plans to apply site specific waste management standards to ckd under the clean air act and rcra to assure that the environment is protected 
the company has established operating practices and is implementing waste management programs that it believes will comply with these anticipated standards  but such practices and programs may not continue to comply in the future if regulations become more restrictive 
the company utilizes hazardous materials such as gasoline  acids  solvents and chemicals as well as materials that have been designated or characterized as hazardous waste by the epa  which it utilizes for energy recovery 
this requires the company to familiarize its work force with the more exacting requirements of applicable environmental laws and regulations with respect to human health and the environment related to these activities 
the failure to observe these exacting requirements could jeopardize the company s hazardous waste management permits and  under certain circumstances  expose it to significant liabilities and costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances into the environment or claims by employees or others alleging exposure to hazardous substances 
the company s steel facilities generate  in the same manner as other similar steel plants in the industry  eaf dust that contains lead  chromium and cadmium 
the epa has listed this eaf dust  which is collected in baghouses  as hazardous waste 
the company has contracts with reclamation facilities in the united states and mexico pursuant to which such facilities receive the eaf dust generated by the company and recover the metals from the dust for reuse  thus rendering the dust non hazardous 
in addition  the company is continually investigating alternative reclamation technologies and has implemented processes for diminishing the amount of eaf dust generated 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company intends to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment and health and safety matters  but since many of these requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable  are presently not determinable  or are likely to be affected by future legislation or rule making by government agencies  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on the company s operations  future net income or financial condition 
notwithstanding the company s intentions to comply with all legal requirements  if injury to persons or damage to property or contamination of the environment has been or is caused by the conduct of its business or hazardous substances or wastes used in  generated or disposed of by it  the company may be liable for such injuries and damages  and be required to pay the cost of investigation and remediation of such contamination 
the amount of such liability could be material and the company may incur material liability in connection with possible claims related to its operations and properties under environmental  health and safety laws 
equipment failure due to the high fixed cost nature of the company s business  interruptions in its production capabilities may cause the company s productivity and results of operations to decline significantly during the affected period 
the company s manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment  such as its cement kilns  grinding mills  stone crushers  steel furnaces  continuous casters and rolling equipment  as well as electrical equipment  such as transformers 
this equipment may  on occasion  be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damaged during accidents  which may lead to production curtailments and shutdowns 
in addition to equipment failures  its facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions or violent weather conditions 
the company has experienced two fires in fiscal year  and may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures or catastrophic events 
earthquakes the company s operations in california are susceptible to damage from earthquakes 
any significant earthquake damage could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company maintains only a limited amount of earthquake insurance and  therefore  is not fully insured against earthquake risk 
other items employees txi has approximately  employees  employed in cac operations   employed in steel operations and the balance employed in corporate resources 
intellectual property while the company maintains trademarks such as txi and maximizer and process patents such as cemstar sm and near net shape casting  the company does not believe any of its active trademarks or patents are essential to the company s business as a whole 
real estate the company is involved in the development of its surplus real estate and real estate acquired for development of high quality industrial and multi use parks in the metropolitan areas of dallas fort worth and houston  texas

this reflects a million decrease in interest incurred as a result of lower average outstanding debt at lower interest rates offset by a million decrease in interest capitalized 
with the completion of the company s major plant expansions no interest was capitalized in income taxes the company s effective tax rate was in  in and in the primary reason that the current tax rate differs from the statutory corporate rate is due to percentage depletion that is tax deductible and state income tax expense 
deferred taxes include a million alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that is available for offset against future regular income taxes 
in addition  the company has million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in dividends on preferred securities net of tax dividends on preferred securities of subsidiary net of tax benefit amounted to million in and million in both and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more complex judgments and estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
the company is subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and makes provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the company s products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for the company s products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
liquidity and capital resources to improve liquidity and provide more financial and operating flexibility  the company on june  issued million of senior notes maturing june  the net proceeds were used to repay the outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility  repurchase all senior notes outstanding at may   and collateralize the letters of credit supporting the variable rate industrial development revenue bonds prior to their retirement on august  the remaining proceeds were applied toward the cost of the company s agreement whereby the entire outstanding interest in the defined pool of trade receivables previously sold was repurchased and the agreement to sell receivables was terminated 
the refinancing adds approximately to the company s overall average effective interest rate and together with the additional amount borrowed is expected to result in higher annual interest costs of approximately million 
effective august   the company entered into an interest rate swap that changes the characteristics of the interest payments on million of the underlying fixed rate payments to short term libor based variable rate payments in order to achieve a mix of interest rates on the company s long term debt which  over time  is expected to moderate financing costs 
in the august quarter  the company will recognize an ordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  representing million in premium or consent payments to holders of the existing senior notes and a write off of million of debt issuance costs associated with the debt repaid 
the new senior notes represent general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the new senior notes were issued by texas industries  inc the parent company  which has no independent assets or operations 
all wholly owned subsidiaries of the company  excluding minor subsidiaries without operations or material assets  have provided a joint and several  full and unconditional guarantee of the securities 
the terms of the notes contain covenants that among other things provide for restrictions on the payment of dividends or repurchasing common stock  making certain investments  incurring additional debt or selling preferred stock  creating liens  and transferring assets 
at any time prior to june   the company may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest  with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings 
in addition  at any time on or prior to june   the company may redeem all or part of the notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued interest and a make whole premium 
after june   the company may redeem all or a part of the notes at a redemption price of in  in and in and thereafter

index to financial statements to replace the revolving credit facility and agreement to sell receivables  the company has entered into a new senior secured credit facility  which will provide up to million of available borrowings  subject to a borrowing base 
the facility matures in june with borrowings limited based on the net amounts of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
initial borrowings will bear annual interest at either the libor based rate plus or the prime rate plus 
these interest rate margins are subject to performance price adjustments 
commitment fees at an annual rate of 
are to be paid on the unused portion of the facility 
the company may terminate the facility at anytime  and under certain circumstances may be required to pay a termination fee 
the senior secured credit facility is collateralized by first priority liens on substantially all of the company s existing and future acquired accounts receivable  inventory  deposit accounts and certain of its general intangibles 
the new debt agreement contains covenants restricting  among other things  prepayment or redemption of notes  distributions  dividends and repurchases of capital stock and other equity interests  acquisitions and investments  indebtedness  liens and affiliate transactions 
in addition  there is the requirement to meet certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios if the excess availability under the senior secured credit facility falls below million  including maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio and meeting a minimum tangible net worth test 
a portion of the company s initial borrowing of million under the senior secured credit facility was applied toward the repurchase of the outstanding interest in the defined pool of trade receivables previously sold 
in addition  million of the facility was reserved to support letters of credit 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is currently limited to borrowings available under the senior secured credit facility 
the payment of cash dividends on common stock is currently limited to an annual amount of million 
the company historically has financed major capital expansion projects with cash from operations and long term borrowings 
working capital requirements and capital expenditures for normal replacement and technological upgrades of existing equipment and expansions of its operations are funded with cash from operations 
the fiscal year capital expenditure budget for these activities is estimated currently at approximately million 
in addition  the company leases certain mobile and other equipment used in its operations under operating leases that in the normal course of business are renewed or replaced by subsequent leases 
after giving effect to the refinancing and initial borrowing under the senior secured credit facility  the company s estimated future payments under its contractual obligations are summarized  as follows future payments by period in thousands total after long term debt operating leases preferred securities of subsidiary total contractual obligations future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced 
outstanding letters of credit generally only collateralize payment of recorded liabilities 
we expect cash from operations and borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments  scheduled debt repayments and working capital needs for at least the next year 
cash flows net cash provided by operations was million in  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to lower operating profit and the related increase in deferred taxes 
cac receivables and inventories are comparable to prior year levels 
steel inventories declined million on lower production 
a scheduled shutdown to refurbish the steel production facilities increased prepaid expenses million 
collection of tax refund claims reduced receivables million  compared to million in the prior year 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million due primarily to higher trade accounts payable

other items litigation in november  chaparral steel company  a wholly owned subsidiary  filed an action in the district court of ellis county  texas against certain graphite electrode suppliers seeking damages for illegal restraints of trade in the sale of graphite electrodes 
during the august quarter the company obtained a settlement from a producer of graphite electrodes in the net amount of million 
the company has now obtained settlements from all the major producers named in the action and does not anticipate any material future settlements 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions  furnace dust disposal and wastewater discharge 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  however  from time to time the company receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that the company is or may be in violation of certain environmental laws and regulations 
based on its experience and the information currently available to it  the company believes that such claims will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
despite the company s compliance and experience  it is possible that the company could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by the company 
market risk the company has not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of the company s investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the fair value of the company s debt outstanding at may   did not exceed its carrying value 
as noted under liquidity and capital resources  the company on june   issued million of senior notes maturing june  the net proceeds were used to repay the outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility  repurchase all senior notes outstanding at may   and collateralize the letters of credit supporting the variable rate industrial development revenue bonds prior to their retirement on august  the remaining proceeds were applied toward the cost of the company s agreement whereby the entire outstanding interest in the defined pool of trade receivables previously sold was repurchased and the agreement to sell receivables was terminated 
the refinancing increased the amount of fixed rate debt outstanding  will add approximately to the company s overall average effective interest rate  and together with the additional amount borrowed is expected to result in higher annual interest costs of approximately million 
the fair value of the debt will vary as interest rates change 
effective august   the company entered into an interest rate swap that changes the characteristics of the interest payments on million of the underlying fixed rate debt from fixed rate payments to short term libor based variable rate payments in order to achieve a mix of interest rates on the company s long term debt which  over time  is expected to moderate financing costs 
the swap is sensitive to interest rate changes 
for example  if short term interest rates increase decrease by one percentage point from the date of the refinancing  annual pretax interest expense would increase decrease by million
