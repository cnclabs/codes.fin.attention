item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following tables and discussion present certain financial information on a comparative basis 
sgi has had declining revenue and has been unprofitable on an operating basis for each of the past six fiscal years as we have felt the impact of the slowdown in the economy  strong competition from much larger companies  technologies and product families in transition and management and employee turnover 
as part of our plan to restore growth and profitability to sgi  we have restructured our overall operations  sustained gross margin levels despite a decline in revenue and significantly reduced our on going operating expenses 
although we made some progress in fiscal  we have continued to experience lower revenues and significant operating losses 
we will continue to focus on actions intended to improve revenue levels  reduce expenses and restore long term growth and profitability 
results of operations years ended june  june  june  in millions total revenue   cost of revenue  gross profit gross profit margin total operating expenses  operating loss interest and other expense income  net loss before income taxes net loss net loss per share basic and diluted revenue the following discussion of revenue is based on the results of our reportable segments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
total revenue is principally derived from three reportable segments servers  workstations and global services  which were determined based on factors including customer base  homogeneity of products  technology  delivery channels and other factors 
effective for fiscal  we reorganized our global services segment and removed the remanufactured systems sales from this segment 
revenue from remanufactured systems is included in the servers and workstations segments 
fiscal amounts have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal and presentation 
total revenue in fiscal decreased million or compared with fiscal  and fiscal revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decline in revenue from both fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal reflected the continued economic slowdown  a significant downturn in it spending  strong competition from much larger companies  the impact of changing sgi japan s status to a distribution model and other factors discussed below that affected particular product families 
the decline in revenue from fiscal to fiscal also reflected the impact of discontinuing certain visualization workstations based on pentium iii microprocessors 
revenue for fiscal included a one time receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an agreement involving a patent cross license and the transfer of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights 
we expect certain of the factors mentioned above to continue to have an adverse impact on our future revenue levels

the following table presents total revenue by reportable segment years ended june  june  june  in millions servers of total revenue workstations of total revenue global services of total revenue other of total revenue fiscal server revenue which includes visualization systems  high performance servers and integrated storage solutions decreased million or compared with fiscal the decline was primarily noted within the high performance server family and to a lesser extent within the visualization systems product family 
these declines reflect delays in the acquisition of technology by private sector businesses concerned about the economy as well as competitive factors including processor speeds  the suitability of low cost cluster solutions for certain application segments  and the timing of releases of key software applications on the irix operating system 
reduced volumes  lower average selling prices caused by a mix shift away from richer configuration systems and the introduction of the altix family of servers  sold at a lower price point than the origin family of servers  contributed to the decline in high performance server revenue compared with fiscal although volumes increased slightly  a shift in mix from the high end visualization systems to the lower end visualization systems with a lower average selling price contributed to the decline in visualization system revenue 
fiscal server revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease primarily reflected declines across all product families within this segment 
this decline was primarily attributable to concerns about the slowdown in the economy that were causing private sector businesses to delay the acquisition of technology wherever possible 
fiscal server revenue levels were also affected by competitive factors  including processor speeds  improvements in commodity graphics performance  the suitability of low cost cluster solutions for certain application segments  and the late release of key software applications on the irix operating system 
see risks that affect our business 
fiscal workstation revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the continuing decline in the overall unix workstation market 
the decline reflected reduced volumes as we completed the end of life of our o and octane families of visual workstations  partially offset by volume increases associated with the introduction of our silicon graphics fuel visual workstation in fiscal declines in workstation revenue were also partially offset by increases in workstation overall average selling prices as the product mix shifted from the lower end o workstations with lower average selling prices to octane and fuel workstations with higher average selling prices 
fiscal workstation revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the continuing decline in the overall unix workstation market 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the discontinuance of certain workstations based upon intel bit microprocessors  the impact of which also contributed to the year over year decline in workstation revenue 
global services revenue is comprised of hardware and software support and maintenance and professional services 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to a reduction in our traditional customer support revenue that is being affected by lower selling prices for new contracts compared with existing contracts  coupled with a decline in the overall installed base reflecting lower system sales volumes in recent periods 
professional services revenue  which includes sgi product  third party product  sgi consulting services and sgi maintenance services  also declined slightly due to the same factors influencing the decline in server  workstation and global services revenue 
fiscal global services revenue decreased million or compared with fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to declines in our professional services revenue as a result of the restructuring of our service organization as well as declines in traditional customer support revenue as a result of lower system sales 
other revenue is generally comprised of our operating units that are not reportable segments  including the product and service revenue of our application software subsidiary  alias 
fiscal other revenue decreased million or principally due to the absence of a transaction similar to the fiscal receipt of million from microsoft resulting from an intellectual property agreement involving a patent cross license and the transfer of certain of sgi s intellectual property rights 
revenue from alias remained relatively consistent in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal other revenue increased million or compared with fiscal the increase was primarily due to the receipt of million from microsoft  offset in part by a decline in alias revenue 
total revenue by geographic area for fiscal  and was as follows in millions years ended june  june  june  area americas  europe rest of world total revenue   geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal   and was as follows years ended june  june  june  area americas europe rest of world the fluctuation in geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue between europe and rest of world business in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to a decline in revenue generated in japan caused by an overall economic decline in the japanese economy and the impact of no longer consolidating the financial results of sgi japan  as a result of our sale of a majority interest in that company 
the fluctuation in geographic revenue as a percentage of total revenue between the americas and rest of world business in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the impact of no longer consolidating the revenue of sgi japan 
a decrease in sales in the asia pacific region in fiscal compared to fiscal also contributed to the decline in rest of world revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
our consolidated backlog at june  was million  down from million at june  backlog is comprised of committed purchase orders for products and professional services deliverable within three to nine months  depending on the product family 
backlog declined in both the americas and europe  offset slightly by a minor increase in rest of world 
from a segment standpoint  the decline was primarily noted in the workstation segment as the overall unix workstation market continues to decline  offset in part by an increase in server backlog  primarily for high performance servers and integrated storage solutions  and backlog for professional services 
gross profit margin cost of product and other revenue includes costs related to product shipments  including materials  labor  overhead and other direct or allocated costs involved in their manufacture or delivery 
costs associated with non recurring engineering revenue are included in research and development expense 
cost of service revenue includes all costs incurred in the support and maintenance of our products  as well as costs to deliver professional services 
overall gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal included in fiscal results was million in revenue recognized from the microsoft intellectual property agreement recorded at margin which accounted for percentage points of the change in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal operationally  we were able to sustain gross profit margins in fiscal compared with fiscal due to our continued improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and procurement practices 
fiscal product and other gross profit margin  excluding the microsoft revenue noted above  declined percentage points compared with fiscal this decline was primarily due to unfavorable product mix and lower volumes  offset in part by favorable manufacturing variances resulting from improved efficiencies in material procurement 
fiscal service gross profit margin improved percentage points despite declining revenue levels primarily due to the restructuring of the service organization in fiscal overall gross profit margin increased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal included in fiscal results was million in revenue recognized from the microsoft intellectual property agreement recorded at margin which accounted for percentage points of the change in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal the remaining improvement in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to decreases in manufacturing overhead expense in the second half of fiscal due to the closure of our manufacturing facility in switzerland  the completion of the restructuring that was announced in the first quarter of fiscal  and a higher margin product mix 
the restructuring included the closure of our manufacturing facility in switzerland and the reorganization of our services business  which has had a significant impact on the increase in our service margins 
gross margin improvements in fiscal were offset slightly due to deconsolidating sgi japan during the second quarter of fiscal  which negatively affects gross margin 
see impact of sgi japan transaction 
operating expenses years ended june  june  june  in millions research and development of total revenue selling  general and administrative of total revenue other of total revenue total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and asset impairment costs 
the significant decline in operating expenses was due to an overall expense reduction program aimed at bringing expenses in line with lower revenue levels 
total fiscal operating expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and asset impairment costs 
fiscal operating expenses included million of charges for restructuring and asset impairment and million of charges as a result of the implementation of an erp system and costs associated with a business reorganization 
research and development fiscal research and development spending decreased million or compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflects a decline in headcount and an overall reduction in research and development activities as a result of continued restructuring actions in order to align expenses with lower revenue levels 
research and development spending decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflected similar factors 
selling  general and administrative fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or compared with fiscal this decrease in operating expenses resulted primarily from a decline in headcount as a result of restructuring and personnel attrition  and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal the fiscal decrease reflected reduced headcount as a result of restructuring activities and attrition  significantly reduced commission and outside service expenses and the impact of our overall expense control measures aimed at bringing operating expenses more in line with revenues 
other operating expense other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by million of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges of million 
other operating expense for fiscal represented a charge for estimated restructuring of million and charges of million associated with the impairment of assets  partially offset by million of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges 
as a result of these restructuring actions  we anticipate cash outflows of million through fiscal for severance and related charges and million through fiscal for facilities related expenditures  net of estimated sublease income 
see note  other operating expense  for further information regarding these activities and note to the consolidated financial statements for restructuring activities initiated in august interest and other years ended june  june  june  in thousands interest expense    foreign exchange gain loss miscellaneous income expense   investment gain loss    interest income    total interest income and other  net    interest expense interest expense increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to the full year impact of higher interest rates on our yen based loan  which was restructured in mid fiscal  as well as interest expense resulting from the inclusion of a prior year tax refund in taxable income 
interest expense increased in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a full year of interest expense associated with our financing arrangement see note and higher interest associated with the reset interest rate on our restructured yen based loan compared with fiscal see note 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net includes interest income on our cash investments  gains and losses on other investments  and other non operating items 
interest income and other  net for fiscal included the receipt of million associated with an investment tax credit refund  million in minority interest income related to our interest in sgi japan  a million impairment charge against an investment held at cost and a million overall loss on the sale of certain parcels of land that occurred throughout the fiscal year 
interest income and other  net for fiscal included a million gain from the sale of of our interest in sgi japan recognized in the second quarter of fiscal  a charge of million for the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit involving a payment of million in cash and the issuance of million shares of common stock and a million loss on the sale of a building recognized in the first quarter of fiscal provision for income taxes our net benefit for income taxes for fiscal totaled million and arose principally from the reassessment of our global tax exposures as well as the receipt of income tax refunds related to prior fiscal years 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal loss  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the criteria for realization under sfas no 
our net benefit for income taxes for fiscal totaled million  which arose principally from a change in the us income tax laws  which resulted in additional us income tax refunds related to the operating results of fiscal partially offsetting this federal income tax benefit are various provisions for income taxes payable in state and foreign jurisdictions 
we did not recognize a benefit for our fiscal loss  since the resulting deferred tax asset does not meet the realizability criteria under sfas no 
at june   we had gross deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million 
the gross deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance of million includes million attributable to benefits of stock option deductions  which  if recognized  will be allocated directly to paid in capital 
at june   we had united states federal  state  and foreign jurisdictional net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion  million and million  respectively 
the federal losses will begin expiring in fiscal year  the state losses will begin expiring in fiscal  and the foreign losses will begin expiring in fiscal year at june   we also had general business credit carryovers of approximately million for united states federal tax purposes  which will begin expiring in fiscal year  and state r d credits of million  which do not have fixed expiration dates 
impact of sgi japan transaction during the second quarter of fiscal  we sold a equity interest in sgi japan to nec and nec soft 
this transaction affected our fiscal results in several ways 
as a minority shareholder  we no longer consolidate the financial results of sgi japan 
we also recognize revenue based on the contractual distribution price of products sold to sgi japan  which for the initial term of our distribution agreement is based on historical pricing 
gross margins are negatively affected by the shift to distributor pricing  which is lower than the price to ultimate customers  offset to some extent by the amortization of the deferred revenue of million that was allocated to the estimated fair value of the exclusive distribution agreement 
this deferred revenue is being recognized as revenue over the three year period beginning in the third quarter of fiscal financial condition at june   cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments totaled million compared with million at june  also  included in the balance sheet at june  and june  is approximately million and million  respectively  of restricted investments 
restricted investments at june  and june  consist of short and long term investments pledged as collateral against bank credit facilities 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared with the prior year is primarily the result of our fiscal operating and investing activities 
fiscal cash and cash equivalents and marketable investments increased by million due principally to the sale of our interest in sgi japan and corporate real estate assets and the million in revenue generated from the microsoft transaction  which along with strong working capital management  offset a million loss from operations 
primarily as a result of net losses  operating activities used million in cash in fiscal  compared with using million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
operating cash flows for fiscal benefited from million in revenue from the microsoft intellectual property agreement that was received in the first quarter 
to present cash flows from operating activities  net loss for each of the past three years had to be adjusted for certain significant items 
fiscal net loss was adjusted to remove the impact of the million restructuring charge 
fiscal net loss is adjusted to remove the impact of the million restructuring charge and a gain of million from the sale of the interest in sgi japan that was reflected as a cash flow from investing activities 
fiscal net loss is adjusted to remove the impact of the million restructuring charge  a non cash charge of million for the write off of an investment in a private company and a gain of million on the sale of marketable investments that is reflected as a cash flow from investing activities 
the negative operating cash flow in fiscal was partially due to approximately million in cash payments for severance  contractual obligations and facilities obligations related to restructuring activities 
these restructuring actions are expected to result in additional future cash outlays of approximately million  of which approximately million are projected to occur in fiscal the negative operating cash flows in both fiscal and fiscal were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable attributable to lower revenue levels coupled with increased focus on customer cash collections and decreased inventory levels 
due to enhanced visibility provided through our global erp system  we have been able to improve cash management programs to more effectively manage the timing of collections and disbursements within normal business cycles 
as a result of these programs  our days sales outstanding improved from an average of days in fiscal to and days in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our investments in inventory have decreased in the past two fiscal years as our revenue levels have declined 
inventory turnover improved and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  compared with the prior periods 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  consumed million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activities during fiscal consisted of increases in prepaid software licenses  equity income resulting from our investment in sgi japan and capital expenditures of million  offset in part by million in proceeds received from the sale of land 
investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was the sale of a interest in sgi japan for proceeds of million and the sale of corporate real estate and other assets for proceeds of million 
these proceeds were offset in part by capital expenditures of million in fiscal investing activities  other than changes in our marketable and restricted investments  provided million in cash during fiscal the principal investing activity during fiscal was the sale of certain corporate real estate for total cash proceeds of million 
these proceeds were partially offset by million of capital expenditures  including capitalized costs associated with our global erp system 
financing activities over the past three years have included the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and option plans  the repurchase of common stock and the repayment of debt 
financing activities during fiscal consumed million compared with using million during fiscal and providing million during fiscal principal financing activities during the fiscal included million in debt payments  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan and employee stock options 
the principal financing activity during fiscal included the retirement of a million mortgage on our manufacturing facility in switzerland and the non cash restructuring of the yen denominated debt from million to million in the second quarter in conjunction with the sale of a majority equity interest in sgi japan 
we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past several fiscal years 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity included unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million  down from million at june  for the year ended june   we used million in cash from operations 
we expect to continue to consume cash from operations through the first half of fiscal we also experience significant intra quarter fluctuations in our cash levels due to timing differences between our payments to vendors and our collections from customers  with the result that our cash balances are generally at their highest point at the end of each quarter and significantly lower at other times 
as a result  we continue to focus on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to maintain adequate levels of unrestricted cash within each quarter 
we also are exploring alternatives for generating additional cash through financing transactions and dispositions of non core assets 
for example  in september we completed the sale of our facility in cortaillod  switzerland for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we are committed to our goal of re establishing profitable operations and positive cash flow 
while a forecast of future events is inherently uncertain  we believe that the combination of our current resources and cash expected to be generated from our fiscal financial plan will be sufficient to meet our financial obligations through fiscal if we experience a material shortfall versus our plan for fiscal  we will take all appropriate actions to ensure the continued operation of our business and to mitigate any negative impact on our profitability and cash reserves 
we have a range of actions we can take to achieve this outcome  including but not limited to expense related actions such as further reductions in headcount related expenses  additional consolidation of administrative functions  re evaluation of our global distribution model  and delayed implementation of information systems initiatives 
we also can take actions to generate cash by selling non core businesses  licensing intellectual property  seeking funding from marketing partners and key government customers  and seeking further equity or debt financing from strategic partners or financial sources 
see risks that affect our business 
we have approximately million of senior convertible notes that will mature in september if we are not able to restructure a substantial portion of these notes to extend the maturity on terms satisfactory to our secured lender by march  our secured credit facility will become due in june at june   our obligation under this facility  net of restricted cash collateral  was million 
during fiscal we commenced an exchange offer with the goal of exchanging new debt securities maturing in for the outstanding notes 
although the exchange offer as amended was supported by the holders of approximately of the notes  we did not achieve the participation level upon which the offer was conditioned  and so we withdrew the offer in august we are continuing our dialogue with the principal holders with the goal of exchanging a substantial majority of the notes for notes with a later maturity 
it is likely that these new notes would carry significantly higher interest rates than the notes and  to the extent that they are convertible obligations  would involve a conversion price close to our recent stock price of approximately 
the nonconvertible notes offered in our recent exchange offer  for example  had an interest rate of 
as of june   future payments due under debt and lease obligations  including facilities vacated as part of our restructuring activities and excluding the benefit of sublease income on our vacated facilities  are as follows in thousands fiscal year ended thereafter total loan payable to sgi japan due december payable in quarterly installments    senior convertible notes due september  convertible subordinated debentures due february non cancelable operating leases     total       included in the above table under non cancelable operating leases are lease payments associated with our amphitheatre technology center campus for which we entered into an agreement to sublease on july  in addition  the table does not reflect the lease payments for the space we will relocate to on the crittenden technology center campus 
adjusting for the impact of this agreement  the non cancelable operating lease payments  excluding the benefit of any sublease income  would be as follows in thousands      and  thereafter 
critical accounting policies and estimates sgi s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all these policies  we caution that future events often do not develop exactly as forecasted  and that even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
a majority of our revenue is derived from sales that are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain revenue is generated from high performance systems that may include customer acceptance criteria and for which revenue is deferred until such acceptance is obtained 
certain revenue is generated on contracts that are longer term in duration 
in these instances  we typically recognize revenue as work progresses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
a small portion of our product revenue is derived from product sales that require estimates for sales returns and other allowances at the time of revenue recognition 
these estimates are based on historical information  current economic trends and other factors 
if the data used to calculate these estimates does not properly anticipate future returns and allowances  revenue could be misstated 
to date  actual experience has been consistent with our estimates 
product warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost to warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate our warranty obligation based on factors such as product lifecycle analysis and historical experience  and our estimate is affected by data such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the factors noted above 
manufacturing inventory and spare parts 
we write down our manufacturing inventory for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
at the end of each quarter  we perform an in depth excess and obsolete analysis of all manufacturing inventory parts on order and on hand based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
for all spare parts on hand  our analysis is based on assumptions about product life cycles  historical usage  current production status and installed base 
additional adjustments to manufacturing inventory and parts may be required if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us during the analyses 
bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to pay their outstanding obligation for reasons such as a deterioration in their operating results or financial position or bankruptcy proceedings  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce their receivable to an amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
if the financial condition of specific customers were to change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
we also record allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are reviewed and adjusted as considered necessary based on the criteria noted above 
restructuring 
in recent fiscal years  we have recorded significant accruals in connection with our restructuring programs 
these accruals include estimates of employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations  including lease terminations resulting from our actions 
accruals associated with vacated facilities and related asset impairments are estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimates may be adjusted upward or downward upon occurrence of a future triggering event 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease  sublease terms and sublease rates 
due to the extended contractual obligations of certain of these leases and the inherent volatility of commercial real estate markets  we expect to make future adjustments to these vacated facilities accruals 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
loss contingencies 
we record an obligation for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and there is a reasonable probability that the ultimate loss will differ from and perhaps exceed the recorded provision 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about the outcome of pending lawsuits and potential actions by third parties including government agencies 
long term investments 
we hold or have held investments in other companies  which are accounted for under either the cost method or equity method of accounting and we monitor these investments for indicators of impairment 
some of these investments could be in companies that are publicly traded and have volatile share prices  while other investments could be in companies that are not publicly traded and therefore the fair value may be difficult to determine 
many of our investments in non publicly traded companies represent emerging technology companies which are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established 
fair values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices 
fair values for investments in privately held companies are estimated based upon factors such as liquidation values  the values of recent rounds of financing  or quoted market prices of comparable public companies 
to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and the financial health of and specific prospects for the company 
other significant accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies regarding financial instruments  stock based compensation and consolidation require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
although no specific conclusions reached by these standards setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity should be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in sfas is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under sfas  in certain cases  would be recognized in future periods as certain events occur rather than up front 
the fasb decided that if the benefit arrangement requires employees to render future service beyond a minimum retention period  a liability should be recognized as employees render service over the future service period even if the benefit formula used to calculate an employee s termination benefit is based on length of service 
contract termination costs under sfas would be recognized and measured at their fair value when an entity terminates the contract in accordance with the contract terms 
contract costs that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to an entity would be recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by the contract  for example  the right to use a leased property 
under sfas  a liability for future lease obligations  reduced by actual or estimated sublease rentals  would be recognized and measured at its fair value at the cease use date  rather than being accrued at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan under issue we adopted the provisions of sfas in connection with restructuring activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies the requirements for a guarantor s accounting and disclosures of certain guarantees issued and outstanding 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  consistent with the interpretation  we have adopted the requirements in this annual report on form k 
the adoption of interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement provides three alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the new disclosure requirements of sfas related to interim financial information are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  consistent with the statement  we have adopted all disclosure requirements in this form k 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

the interpretation establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities that function to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
interpretation applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity 
the provisions of interpretation no 
are effective immediately for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  and no later than the first fiscal period beginning after june  for all variable interests in variable interest entities created before february  the adoption of interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on accounting for arrangements involving the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement with multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the provisions of issue are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of eitf will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  most of the provisions of sfas should be applied prospectively 
we believe the adoption of sfas will have no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with both the characteristics of a liability and equity 
the statement requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability  while many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas will have no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
risks that affect our business sgi operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
we have recently introduced a number of new products  including the sgi altix product family  but we cannot assure you they will achieve market acceptance 
in january  we introduced the sgi altix family of servers and superclusters based on the intel itanium processor and the linux operating system 
risks associated with this new product line include dependence on intel in terms of price  supply  performance  and product roadmaps  the availability of linux applications optimized for the bit itanium platform or our scalable systems architecture  acceptance of the linux operating system in demanding environments  and competition from other suppliers of intel based servers 
there can be no assurance that this new product line will achieve market acceptance or provide significant incremental revenue 
in july  we introduced new highly scalable visualization products 
our ability to achieve future revenue growth will depend significantly on the market success of these products 
if one or more of the product lines were to fail in the market  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we are concentrating our r d investments 
as an increasing percentage of our r d and marketing budget is devoted to potential growth areas  including the sgi altix family  visualization and storage  a declining amount both in percentage and absolute terms is being devoted to the traditional mips irix products  which continue to supply the bulk of our revenue 
managing this transition without unduly compromising the competitiveness of the mips irix family and the quality of support received by customers will be key to our success 
there can be no assurance that this transition will not impair our customer relationships and our competitive position 
we have been incurring losses and consuming cash in our operations and must reverse these trends and generate cash from other sources in fiscal we have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations during each of the past several fiscal years 
at june   our principal sources of liquidity included unrestricted cash and marketable investments of million  down from million at june  we expect to continue to consume cash from operations through the first half of fiscal due to the significant intra quarter fluctuations in our cash levels that result from timing differences between our payments to vendors and our collections from customers  our cash levels tend to be at their highest at the end of the quarter 
as a result  we continue to focus on expense controls and working capital efficiencies to maintain adequate cash levels 
we also are exploring alternatives for generating cash through financing transactions and dispositions of non core assets and will consider a range of alternatives in the event of a material revenue shortfall 
see financial condition 
if we fail to reduce the cash consumption from operations and to generate cash from these other sources on a timely basis  or if the cash requirements of our business change as the result of changes in terms from vendors or other causes  we could no longer have the cash resources required to run our business 
we must restructure most or all of our senior convertible notes before their maturity in september we have approximately million of senior convertible notes that will mature in september following our withdrawal in august of an exchange offer for the notes  we are continuing our dialogue with the principal holders with the goal of exchanging a substantial majority of the notes for bonds with a later maturity 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete this restructuring at all or on terms that will be favorable to our shareholders or us 
it is likely that these new bonds would carry significantly higher interest rates than the bonds and  to the extent that they are convertible obligations  would involve a conversion price close to our recent stock price of approximately 
the nonconvertible bonds offered in our recently withdrawn exchange offer  for example  carried an interest rate of 
our secured credit facility will become due and payable in june if the restructuring of the notes is not completed by march on terms satisfactory to our secured lender 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital when needed 
we have an asset based credit facility that may be declared to be in default if we fail to meet certain financial and other covenants 
this facility matures in april  subject to acceleration upon various events of default or the failure to successfully extend the maturity of of our senior convertible notes due september on terms satisfactory to the secured lender on or before march  the facility is secured by our us and canadian accounts receivable  us inventory and equipment  the pledge of certain intellectual property and million cash collateral 
we also deposit additional cash when eligible accounts receivable and other collateral  which fluctuate within the quarter  are below the level needed to secure our letters of credit 
at june   this facility was secured by a total of million cash collateral 
we obtained waivers of compliance with the covenants of the facility from the lenders in the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal if we are not able to comply with the financial and other covenants of this facility or there is a material adverse change impairing our ability to repay the outstanding balance  the facility may be declared to be in default 
if a default is declared and not waived or if the facility matures and is not renewed  we may not be able to obtain alternative sources of financing on acceptable terms 
in the future  we may need to obtain additional financing to fund our business or repay our debt  and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  if funds are raised through further incurrence of debt  our operations and finances may become subject to further restrictions and we may be required to limit our service or product development activities or other operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
if we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or if we issue equity derivative securities in connection with obtaining debt financing  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the common stock 
we may become involved in intellectual property disputes 
we routinely receive communications from third parties asserting patent or other rights covering our products and technologies 
based upon our evaluation  we may take no action or may seek to obtain a license 
we are in discussions with several parties that have asserted intellectual property infringement claims 
in any given case there is a risk that a license will not be available on terms that we consider reasonable  or that litigation will ensue 
we expect that  as the number of hardware and software patents issued continues to increase  and as competition in the markets we address intensifies  the volume of these intellectual property claims will also increase 
in addition  our increasing visibility as a supplier of linux based systems and as a participant in the open source software movement increases our risk of becoming embroiled in the intellectual property disputes concerning these subjects  such as the current widely reported litigations between sco group on the one hand and ibm and red hat on the other 
we recently received a notice from sco group stating its intention to terminate our fully paid license to certain unix related code  under which we distribute our irix operating system  on the basis that we have breached the terms of such license 
we believe that the sco group s allegations are without merit and that our fully paid license is nonterminable 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that this dispute with sco group will not escalate into litigation  which could have a material adverse effect on sgi  or that sco group s intellectual property claims will not impair the market acceptance of the linux operating system 
we are increasingly dependent on partners and suppliers 
our business has always involved close collaboration with partners and suppliers 
however  many elements of our current business strategy  including the recent addition of scalable servers based on itanium processors and the linux operating system  will increase our dependence on intel and other partners  and on our manufacturing partners and other component suppliers 
our business could be adversely affected  for example  if intel fails to meet product release schedules  if we experience supply constraints  or if we experience any other interruption or delay in the supply chain 
the competitiveness of our system products  particularly our servers  is significantly affected by the availability on our platform of third party software applications that are important to customers in our target markets 
our ability to work with our software partners to ensure porting of these applications to our irix operating system and to linux is a key factor to our business success 
we are dependent on sales to the us government 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to the us government  either directly by us or through system integrators and other resellers 
sales to the government present risks in addition to those involved in sales to commercial customers  including potential disruptions due to appropriation and spending patterns 
the us government can typically terminate or modify its contracts with us at any time for its convenience 
any disruption or limitation in our ability to do business with the us government could have an adverse impact on sgi 
a portion of our business requires security clearances from the us government 
we have implemented measures to maintain our clearances in light of the fact that our chairman and chief executive officer  robert bishop  is an australian citizen 
these arrangements are subject to periodic review by customer agencies and the defense security service of the department of defense 
our business experiences period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons 
delivery cycles  other than those for large scale server products  are typically short 
over half of each quarter s product revenue results from orders booked and shipped during the third month  and disproportionately in the latter half of that month 
these factors make the forecasting of revenue inherently uncertain 
because we plan our operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  on expected revenue  even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause a period s results to be substantially below expectations 
such a revenue shortfall could arise from any number of factors  including lower than expected demand  supply constraints  delays in the availability of new products  transit interruptions  overall economic conditions  military or terrorist actions  or natural disasters 
demand can also be adversely affected by concerns specifically associated with our financial health  and by product and technology transition announcements by sgi or our competitors 
the timing of customer acceptance of certain large scale server products may also have a significant effect on periodic operating results 
margins are heavily influenced by revenue levels  mix considerations  including geographic concentrations  the mix of product and service revenue  and the mix of server and desktop product revenue as well as the mix of configurations within these product categories 
the present global economic uncertainty has impacted the timing of buying decisions of our customers 
unless and until the global economic environment becomes more positive it will be difficult for us to experience growth in revenue 
many of our international sales require export licenses 
our sales to foreign customers are subject to export regulations 
sales of many of our high end products require clearance and export licenses from the us department of commerce under these regulations 
our international sales would be adversely affected if such regulations were tightened  or if they are not modified over time to reflect the increasing performance of our products 
in december we reached agreements with the us departments of commerce and justice to settle civil and criminal export licensing issues related to the sale of four deskside computers in to a russian government laboratory  as well as administrative claims related to sales to other countries 
although there can be no assurance that the settlement will not have an adverse effect on our us government business  we do not believe the settlement should have a significant impact on revenues or important customer relationships 
the swiss authorities are investigating compliance with their export regulations in connection with exports from the swiss manufacturing facility we closed during the second quarter of fiscal we believe that this matter will be resolved without a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may not be able to develop and introduce new products on a timely basis 
meeting our objectives for the future will require that our recently introduced products achieve success in the marketplace and that we succeed in the timely development and introduction of more successful new products 
product transitions are a recurring part of our business 
a number of risks are inherent in this process 
the development of new technology and products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
the introduction of new computer systems requires close collaboration and continued technological advancement involving multiple hardware and software design teams  internal manufacturing teams  outside suppliers of key components such as semiconductors and outsource manufacturing partners 
the failure of any one of these elements could cause our products under development to fail to meet specifications or to miss the aggressive timetables that we establish 
there is no assurance that development or acceptance of our new systems will not be affected by delays in this process 
short product life cycles place a premium on our ability to manage the transition to new products 
we often announce new products in the early part of a quarter while the product is in the final stages of development and testing  and seek to manufacture and ship the product in volume during the same quarter 
our results could be adversely affected by such factors as development delays  the release of products to manufacturing late in any quarter  quality or yield problems experienced by suppliers  variations in product costs and excess inventories of older products and components 
in addition  some customers may delay purchasing existing products in anticipation of new product introductions 
most products are upgraded during their product life cycle 
the ability to upgrade products in a timely fashion is necessary to compete in the computer industry 
delay in introducing updates and upgrades can adversely affect acceptance and demand for product 
downward fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause our common stock to be delisted 
on october  we were notified by the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with its requirement that listed securities trade at a minimum per share price of averaged over a thirty day trading period 
our stock price subsequently recovered  but if it were to decline again and not recover  the nyse could terminate the listing of our common stock 
as of september   the day trading average of our stock was 
declines in the price of our common stock may be caused by our failure to meet the investment community s expectations for quarterly revenue or earnings or by broader market trends unrelated to our performance 
delisting would adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the computer industry is highly competitive  with rapid technological advances and constantly improving price performance 
most of our competitors have substantially greater technical  marketing and financial resources 
they also generally have a larger installed base of customers and a wider range of available applications software 
competition may result in significant discounting and lower gross margins 
we may not be able to retain and attract qualified employees 
our success depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical  sales and marketing and management personnel 
the uncertainties surrounding our business prospects and our continuing restructuring actions have increased the challenges of retaining world class talent 
we implemented further restructuring actions during fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to work through the turnaround process  there is no guarantee that we will not lose highly qualified employees or that we will be able to hire highly qualified candidates as new skills are needed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subjected to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  as well as the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  we do not anticipate material losses in these areas 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our convertible subordinated notes 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in high quality money market instruments and debt instruments and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three years 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and financial instruments 
the financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis consist of all of our cash and cash equivalents  marketable investments  short term and long term debt and all derivative financial instruments 
currency forward contracts and currency options constitute our portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
to perform sensitivity analysis  we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments 
we compute the market values for interest risk based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted by the changes in rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
we selected the discount rates used for the present value computations based on market interest rates in effect at june  we computed the market values for foreign exchange risk based on spot rates in effect at june  the market values that result from these computations are compared to the market values of these financial instruments at june  the differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk 
the results of the sensitivity analysis at june  are as follows interest rate risk a percentage point decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a increase in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  a percentage point increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the aggregate fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  foreign currency exchange rate risk a strengthening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair values of our financial instruments by million june  a weakening of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair values of our financial instruments by million at june  the financial instruments measured in the foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity analysis are used in our hedging program to reduce our overall corporate exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
