item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant factors in performance for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  this financial discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss and satisfaction of significant obligations  if any 
the company generally considers this to occur upon receipt of products by the customer  although some customers accept title upon shipment 
the company provides an allowance for sales returns  which is based on historical experience 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  the company takes title to the products sold upon shipment  bears credit risk  and bears inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  although some of these risks are mitigated through arrangements with the company s shippers and suppliers 
service revenues are recognized based on contracted hourly rates  as services are rendered  or upon completion of specified contracted services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts and estimated allowances for sales returns 
cost of sales include the cost of product and services sold and current and estimated allowances for product returns that will not be accepted by the company s suppliers  less rebates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s estimate of its allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
first  the company evaluates specific accounts over days outstanding and applies various levels of risk analysis to these accounts to determine a satisfactory risk category to which given percentages are applied to establish a reserve 
second  a general reserve is established for all other accounts  exclusive of the accounts identified for the specific reserve  in which a percentage is applied that is supportable by historic collection patterns 
product returns 
in general  the company follows a strict policy of duplicating the terms of its vendor or manufacturers product return policies 
however  in certain cases the company must deviate from this policy in order to satisfy the requirements of certain sales contracts and or to satisfy or maintain customer relations 
to establish a reserve for returns  outstanding return merchandise authorizations rma are reviewed 
those rmas issued for which the related product has not been returned by the customer are considered future sale reversals and are fully reserved 
in addition  an estimate  based on historical return patterns  is provided for probable future rmas that relate to past sales 
vendor returns 
after product has been returned to vendors under authenticated rmas  the company reviews such outstanding receivables from its vendors and establishes a reserve on product that will not qualify for refund based on a review of specific vendor receivables 
rebates and cooperative advertising allowances 
the company receives incentives from suppliers related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the suppliers  however  some of these incentives are product driven or are provided to support specific programs established by the supplier 
suppliers generally require that the company use their cooperative advertising allowances exclusively for advertising or other marketing programs 
these restricted cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction of operating expense as the related marketing expenses are recognized  however  the company is evaluating the impact of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which  during fiscal will require reclassification of a portion of certain funds received from vendors from operating expense to gross profit  but will have no effect on net income 
as rebates are earned  the company records the rebate receivables with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold 
any amounts received from suppliers related to cooperative advertising allowances  are deferred until earned 
rebate programs are subject to audit as to whether the requirements of the rebates were actually met 
the company establishes reserves to cover any collectibility risks including subsequent supplier audits 
inventory 
although the company employs a virtual inventory model that generally limits its exposure to inventory losses  with certain large customers the company contractually obligates itself to product availability terms that require maintaining physical inventory  as well as configured product 
such inventory is generally confined to a very limited range of product that applies to specific customers or contracts 
included in the company s inventory is product that has been returned by customers but is not acceptable as returnable by the vendor 
as a result  the company exposes itself to losses from such inventory that requires reserves for losses to be established 
the company records varying reserves based upon the class of inventory ie held for resale or returned from customers and age of inventory 
overview the company initially began its operations in march of as a reseller of information technology products 
in fiscal  the company began offering value added services to its customers 
gradually value added services represented a larger percentage of total net sales  accounting for and of the company s net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the gross profit margins on the value added services that the company currently offers are significantly higher than the gross profit margins on the company s information technology product business  but require additional overhead expense for supervision  idle time  and other expenses related to service offerings that in part offset a portion of the increased margin 
in the company s initial operating years  net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of increasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal seasonal trends were not prominent in the company s business  although the march quarter was historically regarded as one of the least promising quarters 
the past growth in net sales was principally driven by a robust economy and information technology market that accommodated the company s business model and allowed it to expand geographically through the opening of sales offices 
however  in fiscal the company experienced its first annual decline that resulted in million in sales due to a softer information technology market and difficulties in transitioning to a new erp business system 
that declining trend continued in the following fiscal years and that registered declines of and million  respectively 
the reversal of the negative net sales trend began in the first quarter of fiscal and set the tone for an improvement that continued throughout the fiscal year and resulted in a million increase in net sales for the fiscal year over the prior year 
operating expenses for the fiscal year  exclusive of special charges  were million  a million increase from prior year operating expenses of million 
the increase in operating expenses was attributed to the million increase in selling and marketing expenses and was principally incurred to increase the direct sales force and boost sales productivity 
special charges also increased by million due the payment of a legal settlement in the fiscal year while the prior fiscal year recognized income from a favorable legal settlement and recovery of expenses 
because the company s business model involves the resale of information technology products held in inventory by certain distributors  the company does not maintain significant amounts of inventory on hand for resale 
the company typically does not place an order for product purchases from distributors until it has received a customer purchase order 
inventory is then drop shipped by the distributor to either the customer or shipped to the company s configuration center in ontario  california 
the distributor typically ships products within hours following receipt of a purchase order and  consequently  substantially all of the company s net sales in any quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
although the company maintains a relatively small amount of inventory in stock for resale  it records as inventory the merchandise being configured and products purchased from distributors and shipped  but not yet received and accepted by customers 
product revenues are generally recognized upon shipment 
service revenues are recognized based on contractual hourly rates as services are rendered or upon completion of specified contract services 
net sales consist of product and service revenues  less discounts 
cost of sales includes product and service costs and current and estimated allowances for returns of products that are not accepted by the company s distributors or manufacturers  less any incentive credits 
in june of  firstsource corp 
firstsource  formerly firstsource 
com and purchase pointe  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  began operations as an internet based business to business provider of products and services 
from a series of private placements of equity capital  the company s voting interest in may dropped below 
with the company not otherwise having effective control over firstsource  the company began accounting for its investment in its former subsidiary under the equity method of accounting 
on april   firstsource ceased operations entirely and all of its assets were assigned to sherwood partners  inc unaffiliated with the company  as an assignee for the benefit of creditors 
in november  the company formed a new subsidiary  supplyaccess  inc supplyaccess 
supplyaccess was designed as an internet portal charging transaction fees to the seller 
the company transferred its information technology department and related computer equipment and software to supplyaccess in exchange for a million note receivable 
no gain or loss was recognized on the transaction 
concurrently it was agreed that supplyaccess would provide the company with information technology services and would allow company customers access to its fulfillment engine for the initial year for a flat quarterly fee of in a series of private placements of equity capital that began in february that were undertaken to raise additional capital  the company s voting interest in supplyaccess was eventually reduced to 
with the company s interest dropping below  and not otherwise having control over its former subsidiary  in april the company began accounting for its supplyaccess investment under the equity method of accounting 
on september   the company in settlement of a dispute with supplyaccess  agreed to pay supplyaccess million for the assignment and transfer of the en pointe sap application software and certain other listed assets 
in so doing  effective october   the company cancelled the balance of the note receivable from supplyaccess of  and agreed to assume the information technology responsibilities previously assigned to supplyaccess 
in january  a majority of the shareholders of supplyaccess approved the transfer of the assets of supplyaccess to a liquidator for the benefit of creditors 
at the time of this transfer  en pointe owned approximately of the voting securities of supplyaccess 
in connection with the liquidation of supplyaccess in february  the company acquired full rights to accesspointe tm as well as the rights to all of supplyaccess software  copyrights  trade secrets and other proprietary rights 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses special charges income operating loss interest expense  net other income  net loss before income taxes and income from affiliates benefit for income taxes income from reversal of losses from affiliates net loss income comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales has been steady throughout the fiscal year  as net sales have increased in each of the current year s fiscal quarters over those reported in the respective quarters of the prior fiscal year 
the tabin corporation acquisition that was made in october provided approximately million of the million increase in net sales  or 
for the year ended september   net sales were less concentrated than in previous fiscal years with no customer accounting for or more of total net sales 
while product sales led service sales in registering the largest dollar increase  service sales easily outpaced product sales in terms of percentage growth from that of the prior fiscal year 
product net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal service revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal a portion of the strong growth in service revenues can be attributed to several projects that favorably impacted the second half of fiscal that are expected to wind down in early fiscal gross profit 
gross profits increased million or to million in fiscal from million for fiscal year of the million increase in gross profits  million can be attributed to increased sales volume  with the balance  million  resulting from improved margins  chiefly those of services 
sales of product contributed million to the increase in gross profits  or   while service sales contributed most of the gross profit increase  million  or  expressed as a percentage of net sales  the gross profit percentage increased to from the recorded in the prior fiscal year 
all of the growth in gross profit margins is attributable to services whose gross profit margins increased to from the recorded in the prior fiscal year 
the service profit margin increase is attributable to a small number of short term projects and is not necessarily considered representative of anticipated future service margins 
product gross profit margins held steady at  up a marginal tenth of a percent from that of the prior fiscal year 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the expense increase related to selling and marketing expenses arising from the company s commitment that commenced late in fiscal to reverse past sales declines by selectively increasing the size of its direct sales force 
therefore  most of the increase in selling and marketing expenses relates to commissions  salaries and wage related benefits 
to mitigate the costs associated with increasing the direct sales force and to boost productivity  the company  late in the june fiscal quarter  initiated an offshore outsourcing program for much of its back office sales support 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was decidedly less when expressed as a percentage of net sales because of the improvement in net sales 
increased sales provided a larger base for spreading certain fixed elements of selling and marketing expense 
as a result  selling and marketing expenses increased only to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal factors responsible for the reduction in general and administrative expenses included reduced wage related expenses of million and reduced facilities related expense of million 
the offshore outsourcing program that began in the june fiscal quarter contributed to the reduction in wages as did the reduction in wages from the decline in the number of personnel employed 
rent reduction resulted from the finalization of the closure of certain branch offices that were no longer operational as well as the prior year s renegotiation of the headquarters lease in may of the benefits of the reduction of expense related to wages and facilities were reduced by the million increase in legal expense 
when general and administrative expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  there was a decrease of from to in fiscal special charges income 
charges of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the february settlement of a litigation claim 
the court approved the dismissal and settlement of the stockholder derivative litigation  fredrick v 
din  et al 
as a part of the stipulation of the parties  it was agreed that the defendants would pay the plaintiff s attorney fees of approximately million 
after a review by selected members of the company s board of directors who were not defendants in the litigation  and based on the board s review and recommendation  the company paid the settlement and charged the full amount to expense 
operating loss 
operating loss decreased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal from a million operating loss in fiscal the decrease was attributed to an million increase in gross profits reduced by an increase of million in operating expenses 
the operating loss when expressed as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in interest expense 
interest expense is net of interest income of million 
interest expense incurred under the foothill financing agreement consisted principally of charges for acting as guarantor to ibmcc in order for ibmcc to provide a day interest free flooring to the company 
in addition to the guarantee charge  foothill charged from to per annum for use of their line and for float and per annum for any unused credit line 
total interest and related charges paid to foothill amounted to million 
most of the interest expense  million  incurred by the company represents interest expense related to the ontario facility lease that is being treated as a financing lease and is presently carried as a long term liability 
income from reversal of losses from affiliates 
as a result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries  in the june quarter of the company began using the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the losses related to the two affiliates 
because the company had guaranteed certain debt of its affiliates and was responsible under certain other obligations  losses in excess of the company s investment in its affiliates were recorded 
the majority of the income from the reversal of losses  million was reversed in fiscal  with million reversed in fiscal and the remaining balance of million reversed in the first quarter of fiscal year benefit provision for income taxes 
the company has not recorded a tax benefit in the current year as it is likely that any tax benefits will not be realized in the near future 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recognized an unanticipated net million federal income tax benefit 
the job creation and worker assistance act of tax bill allowed the company to carry back net operating losses nols arising from the current fiscal year as well as from the prior fiscal year to recover taxes from the two fiscal years ended september  and that were previously closed to such carry backs 
the company files a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of its state tax returns it files separately under the name of its wholly owned sales subsidiary en pointe technologies sales  inc that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
in carrying tax losses back to prior years the company has exhausted all of its benefits from recovery of taxes paid in prior years so that any future losses will have to be carried forward to apply to future income years 
as of september  the company had million of such net operating losses nols that may be carried forward of which million nol will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since that portion of the nol was attributable to the exercise of stock options by employees which had not been recognized as expense for financial statement purposes 
net loss income 
the net loss decreased million  or  to million from the million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss is due to the increase in gross profits of million offset  in part  by an increase in operating expenses of million  which when combined reduced the operating loss by million 
however  the million reduced operating loss was offset by increased interest expense and decreased other income of million and million less tax benefit and less income from the reversal of losses of affiliates than was recognized in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  the net loss was  as compared with in fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline represents a continuation of weak capital spending by business that has been noted in the quarterly reports 
while the decline in net sales has been persistent over the past eight quarters  the most severe decline of in quarter over prior year quarter net sales occurred in the last quarter of fiscal year following closely on the heels of that decline  the first quarter of fiscal year registered a negative 
since the first quarter of fiscal  quarter declines have moderated 
for the march  june  and september quarters of fiscal the percentage declines were   and respectively 
product net sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million decrease is exclusive of million of miscellaneous excess credits previously granted to customers that were taken to income as a part of an ongoing process to improve customer transaction processing 
service revenues also declined million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal for the year ended september   two of the company s major customers accounted for million or of net sales  as follows with amounts stated in millions fiscal year net sales fiscal year net sales customer customer gross profit 
the decline in net sales directly impacted gross profits  reducing gross profits by million or to million in fiscal from million for gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales also slid fractionally by a tenth of a percent to in from in the million decline in gross profits can be traced to lower margins on product sales 
product gross profits decreased million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
expressed as a percentage of net sales  the product gross profit percentage declined from in the prior fiscal year to 
the decline in product gross profit is attributable to more aggressive pricing policies employed for capturing market share  including large sales of microsoft software licenses at relatively low margins  as well as a lessening in rebate income that is dependent on volume sales and manufacturer vender availability 
service gross profits also fell as a result of the decline in service revenues  registering a total decline of million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
however  service gross profits expressed as a percentage of service revenues increased to from the in the prior fiscal year 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal most of the million decrease  million  relates to the reduction of commissions  salaries and wage related benefits 
since sales commissions are computed based on gross margin dollars under the company s method of commission payment  declines in gross profits  as was experienced in the fiscal year  will directly reduce commission expense 
because declining sales volume provides less of a base for spreading certain fixed selling and marketing expenses  selling and marketing expenses when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased a very slight million or to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal a reduction in facilities related expense  including rent reduction from renegotiation of the headquarters lease contributed to the reduction in general and administrative expense 
as with selling and marketing expenses  when general and administrative expenses are expressed as a percentage of net sales  such expenses show an increase of from to in fiscal  which can be attributable again to the decline in net sales volume 
special charges income 
income of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the settlement of a litigation claim  million 
in the settled litigation claim  the company was liable for a total of million under various court decisions including accrued interest and settled for million 
in addition  there was a recovery of million of insurance reimbursement relating to previously expensed legal fees offset by other legal costs of million 
operating loss 
operating loss increased million  or  to a loss of million in fiscal from a million operating loss in fiscal although total operating expenses decreased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  the decrease was insufficient to compensate for the million decline in gross profits 
because of declining sales volume  providing less base for spreading expenses  operating loss when expressed as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in interest expense 
interest expense is net of interest income of million 
interest expense incurred under the foothill financing agreement consisted principally of charges for acting as guarantor to ibmcc in order for ibmcc to provide a day interest free flooring to the company 
in addition to the guarantee charge  foothill charged from to per annum for float and per annum for any unused credit line 
total interest and related charges paid to foothill amounted to million million less than the prior fiscal year 
most of the interest expense  million in both fiscal years and  incurred by the company represents interest expense related to the ontario facility lease that is being treated as a financing lease and is presently carried as a long term liability 
income from reversal of losses from affiliates 
as a result of the deconsolidation of two previously consolidated subsidiaries in the june quarter of the company began using the equity method of accounting to record its interest in the losses related to the two affiliates 
because the company had guaranteed certain debt of its affiliates and was responsible under certain other obligations  losses in excess of the company s investment in its affiliates were recorded 
such losses were in large part reversed in fiscal and taken to income as the guarantees and obligations were removed or discharged 
total income from reversal of losses for the year amounted to million  which includes million of profit on past sales to affiliates  million of estimated costs in transitioning information technology services the related costs for which were previously incurred and reported in operations in the first quarter of the current fiscal year  and million for lease guarantees for one of its former affiliates 
the much larger prior fiscal year income from the reversal of losses of million included a reversal of million of lender guarantees provided by the company to one of its affiliates along with the reduction of information technology reserves for the resumption of information technology responsibilities and the reversal of a note reserve related to an affiliate 
benefit provision for income taxes 
the company files a consolidated federal income tax return  while for many of its state tax returns it files separately under the name of its wholly owned sales subsidiary en pointe technologies sales  inc that is qualified to do business in all fifty states 
with the march  passage of the job creation and worker assistance act of tax law  the company recognized an unanticipated net million federal income tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal year the tax bill allowed the company to carry back net operating losses nols arising from the current fiscal year as well as from the prior fiscal year to recover taxes from the two fiscal years ended september  and that were previously closed to such carry backs 
the total tax benefits recognized by the company under the new tax law were million for the year  of which million was from prior year nol 
offsetting  in part  the million of federal tax benefits for nols  was million of tax expense  most of which related to a prior year amended federal income tax return 
in carrying tax losses back to prior years the company has exhausted all of its benefits from recovery of taxes paid in prior years so that any future losses will have to be carried forward to apply to future income years 
as of september  the company had million of such nols that may be carried forward of which million nol will be considered an adjustment to additional paid in capital and will not benefit future earnings  since that portion of the nol was attributable to the exercise of stock options by employees which had not been recognized as expense for financial statement purposes 
net loss income 
a net loss of million was realized for fiscal year as compared to net income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the net effect of the change from net income to net loss amounted to million 
a decrease in gross profits of million  offset  in part  by a reduction in operating expenses of million resulted in an operating loss change to million 
however  the million operating loss change was further adversely impacted by million  consisting of million less benefits from the reversal of losses from affiliates reduced by the million of tax benefits from the tax law change 
as a percentage of net sales  the net loss was  as compared with a net income of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  operating activities provided cash totaling million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
contributing to the increase in operating cash was the decline in the net loss of million  the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  and the collection of million in recoverable taxes 
the major expenditure of operating cash was for the build up of accounts receivable of million  directly relating to the growth of net sales by million from the prior fiscal year 
the company s accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts  at september  and  was million and million  respectively 
the number of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased slightly to days from days  as of september  and  respectively 
investing activities used cash totaling million for fiscal  an increase of million 
most of the increase  million  related to the october acquisition of tabin corporation 
financing activities used net cash totaling million in fiscal  while providing cash of million in fiscal the cash used in fiscal was chiefly from the repayment of net borrowings of million under the company s lines of credit  while million of cash was provided from net borrowings activities in fiscal as of september   the company had approximately million in cash and working capital of million 
the company has a three year million revolving credit facility with foothill capital corporation foothill that expires on december  in addition  ibm credit corporation ibmcc has provided the company with a day interest free inventory flooring financing for up to million under a separate one year agreement expiring on december  as of september   most of the company s borrowings under its credit lines were concentrated in the million borrowings outstanding under its ibmcc day interest free flooring agreement 
at september   the company had additional borrowing capacity of approximately million after taking into consideration the available collateral and borrowing limitations under its financing agreements 
borrowings under both lending agreements are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
in addition  the lines of credit contains certain financing and operating covenants relating to net worth  liquidity  profitability  repurchase of indebtedness and prohibition on payment of dividends  as well as restrictions on the use of proceeds obtained under the line 
at september  the company was in compliance with the amended ebitda covenants and the various other debt covenants contained in the loan agreements 
the company foresaw that it would be unable to meet its covenants related to liquidity and profitability for the quarter ended march  and would be in default under the terms of such agreements 
to avert such a default  the company renegotiated its lines of credit with ibmcc and foothill to ease their respective covenant requirements and signed amendments to each of its financing agreements in may under the amendments to the loan agreements the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and tangible net worth covenants have been reset for both loan agreements 
ebitda is measured on a cumulative rolling twelve month basis ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter  with the september  quarter set at a negative million  the december  quarter set at a positive million  and all fiscal quarters thereafter set at a positive million 
tangible net worth is measured on the last day of each fiscal quarter 
for the quarter ended september  and for the immediate quarter thereafter  tangible net worth may not be less than million  and million  respectively 
beginning with quarter ending march  and each quarter thereafter the tangible net worth may not be less than million 
in addition  ibmcc added a new covenant that limits product backlog to million at any given time 
as consideration for the amendments to the loan covenants  the lenders increased some borrowing rates and ibmcc reduced the available ibmcc credit line 
the ibmcc amended credit line provides the company with day free inventory flooring financing for up to million down from million 
borrowing availability on the foothill credit facility is directly reduced by any outstanding flooring financings 
the financing agreement with foothill includes a guarantee to ibmcc for the amount outstanding on the flooring line up to a maximum of million 
in consideration for providing the guarantee  the amended foothill agreement contains a annual charge up from on the average outstanding balances owing to ibmcc 
the foothill financing agreement also contains a annual charge for any unused portion of the credit line 
the variable interest rate at the option of the company is based on either the prime rate or the libor rate 
under the amended foothill agreement  the maximum rate for the interest  which is based on certain targets related to ebitda  was increased to prime rate plus and  under the libor option  was similarly increased to the libor rate plus 
as reflected  in part  in the financial statements contained in part iv  item  the company experienced losses from operations in each of the last three fiscal years and declining sales in the fiscal years ended september  and while the company has made progress in improving its net sales and loss from operations in the fiscal year ended september   there is no assurance that the company can continue such progress and obtain its goal of profitability 
in order to counter the prior year s sales and profitability declines  in the second quarter of fiscal  there was a change in certain key executives 
as part of that change  the chairman and ceo returned to his former position as president of the company with responsibility for day to day operations 
in addition  the company rehired its former senior vice president of sales and certain senior sales employees who had previously worked at the company 
the new management team took the following actions intended to increase sales and improve profitability a refocused the company s sales strategy back to an aggressive personal face to face selling model by hiring new account executives an increase of approximately from the number of account executives employed prior to the change in management and implementing more robust processes for managing account executives performance against sales quotas  b reasserted the company s focus on selling managed services which have higher gross margins than product sales  c qualified the company as a minority owned business in order to provide it with enhanced sales opportunities for certain public and private sector customers whose procurement policies provide preferences to minority owned businesses  d committed the company to a strategy of acquiring targeted smaller competitors where the company believes that the acquisition will be immediately accretive to earnings and the company has the opportunity to complete the acquisition at an affordable price 
in october  the company completed the acquisition of tabin corporation 
e beginning in june  contracted with off shore firms to provide back office operations and accounting services at reduced rates 
as discussed above  the company has a million line of credit agreement with foothill  which expires in december the company also has a million inventory flooring agreement with ibm credit corporation ibmcc  which expires on december  borrowings under the inventory flooring agreement serve to reduce the availability of financing available under the line of credit agreement 
management believes that the financing available to the company under these credit agreements  together with its own working capital resources at september   the company had net working capital of approximately million will provide the company with sufficient working capital to finance its operations through at least the next fiscal year 
also as discussed above  both the foothill and ibmcc agreements contain certain restrictive covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of specified levels of tangible net worth and the attainment of specified amounts of profitability 
there can be no assurance that management s plans will be successful in improving the company s sales and profitability or that the company will be able to maintain compliance with its loan covenants 
if the company is unable to maintain compliance with its loan covenants and if such noncompliance is not waived by the lenders  the working capital line of credit and flooring line could be revoked prior to their expiration dates 
in such eventuality  management believes that it has sufficient working capital to enable it to continue to operate through at least september  however  the company would be required to significantly scale down its business plans if it were unable to obtain alternative sources of financing 
on october   the company advanced  to en pointe global services  inc see note 
as a result of this transaction  the company is in violation of certain debt covenants 
the company has received a verbal commitment from foothill to provide a waiver of the company s noncompliance  however  negotiations have not been completed and there can be no assurance that such a waiver of noncompliance will be granted

for the guarantee to ibmcc  foothill charges the company per annum on average outstanding balances owed to ibmcc 
through judicious use of its ibmcc interest free flooring  the company has been able to largely limit its interest charges to million on borrowings in fiscal year  of which million represents the cost of the guarantee to ibmcc 
because of the company s ability to have available interest free flooring  assuming interest rates increase by an assumed percentage in the next fiscal year  there would be little financial impact upon the company for any incremental increase  so long as the company is successful in limiting its borrowing from foothill by continuing to use its million day interest free flooring 
borrowings in excess of million would  of course  be subject to foothill s borrowing rate of up to a maximum of over prime with the prime rate at as of september  
the company is also committed to off balance sheet obligations represented by operating leases for office facilities and various types of office equipment which are fully disclosed in the financial statement footnotes
