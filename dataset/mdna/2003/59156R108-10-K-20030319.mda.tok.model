institutional 
the charges to this segment in the fourth quarter of include costs associated with exiting a business  including the write off of goodwill  severance and severance related costs  and facilities consolidation costs 
these expenses are the result of the discontinuance of certain k recordkeeping services and externally managed guaranteed index separate accounts 
these actions resulted in charges to policyholder benefits and claims and other expenses of million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately million of the charges recorded in were released into income primarily as a result of the accelerated implementation of the company s exit from the large market k business 
the business realignment initiatives will ultimately result in the elimination of approximately positions 
as of december   there were approximately terminations to be completed 
the company continues to carry a liability as of december  since the exit plan could not be completed within one year due to circumstances outside the company s control and since certain of its contractual obligations extended beyond one year 
individual

as of december   there were approximately terminations to be completed 
these costs were recorded in other expenses 
the remaining liability as of december  is due to certain contractual obligations that extended beyond one year

september  tragedies on september  terrorist attacks occurred in new york  washington  dc and pennsylvania the tragedies triggering a significant loss of life and property which had an adverse impact on certain of the company s businesses 
the company has direct exposure to these events with claims arising from its individual  institutional  reinsurance and auto home insurance coverages  and it believes the majority of such claims have been reported or otherwise analyzed by the company 
the company s original estimate of the total insurance losses related to the tragedies  which was recorded in the third quarter of  was million  net of income taxes of million 
net income for the year ended december  includes a million  net of income taxes of million  benefit from the reduction of the liability associated with the tragedies 
the revision to the liability is the result of an analysis completed during the fourth quarter of  which focused on the emerging incidence experienced over the past months associated with certain disability products 
as of december   the company s remaining liability for unpaid and future claims associated with the tragedies was million  principally related to disability coverages 
this estimate has been and will continue to be subject to revision in subsequent periods  as claims are received from insureds and the claims to reinsurers are identified and processed 
any revision to the estimate of gross losses and reinsurance recoveries in subsequent periods will affect net income in such periods 
reinsurance recoveries are dependent on the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers  which may be adversely affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with the tragedies 
the company s general account investment portfolios include investments  primarily comprised of fixed maturities  in industries that were affected by the tragedies  including airline  other travel  lodging and insurance 
exposures to these industries also exist through mortgage loans and investments in real estate 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio exposed to industries affected by the tragedies was approximately billion at december the long term effects of the tragedies on the company s businesses cannot be assessed at this time 
the tragedies have had significant adverse effects on the general economic  market and political conditions  increasing many of the company s business risks 
this may have a negative effect on metlife s businesses and results of operations over time 
in particular  the declines in share prices experienced after the reopening of the us equity markets following the tragedies have contributed  and may continue to contribute  to a decline in separate account assets  which in turn may have an adverse effect on fees earned in the company s businesses 
in addition  the company has received and expects to continue to receive disability claims from individuals resulting from the tragedies

acquisitions and dispositions in june  the company acquired aseguradora hidalgo sa hidalgo  an insurance company based in mexico with approximately billion in assets as of the date of acquisition 
the purchase price is subject to adjustment under certain provisions of the purchase agreement 
the company does not expect that any purchase price adjustment will have an impact on its consolidated statements of income

the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  mortgage loans and real estate  all of which are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and vi other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
derivatives the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions primarily to manage the risk associated with variability in cash flows related to the company s financial assets and liabilities or to changing fair values 
the company also purchases investment securities and issues certain insurance and reinsurance policies with embedded derivatives 
the associated financial statement risk is the volatility in net income which can result from i changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as accounting hedges  and ii ineffectiveness of designated hedges in an environment of changing interest rates or fair values 
in addition  accounting for derivatives is complex  as evidenced by significant authoritative interpretations of the primary accounting standards which continue to evolve  as well as the significant judgments and estimates involved in determining fair value in the absence of quoted market values 
these estimates are based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate in the circumstances 
such assumptions include estimated market volatility and interest rates used in the determination of fair value where quoted market values are not available 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new insurance business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
the amount of future profit is dependent principally on investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs 
the aforementioned factors enter into management s estimates of gross margins and profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross margins and profits are less than amounts deferred 
in addition  the company utilizes the reversion to the mean assumption  a standard industry practice  in its determination of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
this practice assumes that the expectation for long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but that it does change when large interim deviations have occurred 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  annuities and disability insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing of the products 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  expenses  persistency  investment returns and inflation 
the company also establishes liabilities for unpaid claims and claims expenses for property and casualty insurance 
pricing of this insurance takes into account the expected frequency and severity of losses  the costs of providing coverage  competitive factors  characteristics of the insured and the property covered  and profit considerations 
liabilities for property and casualty insurance are dependent on estimates of amounts payable for claims reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are influenced by historical experience and actuarial assumptions of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management strategies 
differences between the actual experience and assumptions used in pricing these policies and in the establishment of liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish policy benefits and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed above 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company must determine if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company must review all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the company is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a contract does not expose it to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 
litigation the company is a party to a number of legal actions 
given the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is difficult to estimate the impact of litigation on the company s consolidated financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables used to determine amounts recorded 
the data and variables that impact the assumption used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease  the jurisdiction of claims filed  tort reform efforts and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
employee benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions which include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plan and its assets  and consultation with an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the company s aggregate projected benefit obligation may vary and include an expectation of long term market appreciation in equity markets which is not changed by minor short term market fluctuations  but does change when large interim deviations occur 
for the largest of the plans sponsored by the company the metropolitan life retirement plan for united states employees  with a projected benefit obligation of billion or of all qualified plans at december   the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  and the range of rates of future compensation increases used in that plan s valuation at december  were  and to  respectively 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for use in that plan s valuation in is currently anticipated to be

this variance is primarily attributable to increases in the institutional  international and reinsurance segments 
a million increase in institutional is largely due to sales growth in its group life  dental  disability and long term care businesses  a sale of a significant retirement and savings contract in the second quarter of  as well as new sales throughout in this segment s structured settlements and traditional annuity products 
the june acquisition of hidalgo  the acquisitions in chile and brazil and the sale of an annuity contract in the first quarter of to a canadian trust company are the primary drivers of a million increase in international 
a portion of the increase in international is also attributable to business growth in south korea  mexico excluding hidalgo  spain and taiwan 
in addition  an increase in canada due to the restructuring of a pension contract from an investment type product to a long term annuity contributed to this variance 
new premiums from facultative and automatic treaties  and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business contributed to a million increase in the reinsurance segment 
universal life and investment type product policy fees increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this variance is primarily attributable to the individual  international and institutional segments 
a million favorable variance in individual is due to an increase in policy fees from insurance products  primarily due to higher revenue from insurance fees  which increase as the average separate account asset base supporting the underlying minimum death benefits declines 
the average separate account asset base has declined in in response to poor equity market performance 
these increases are partially offset by lower policy fees from annuity and investment type products generally resulting from poor equity market performance despite growth in annuity deposits 
management would expect policy fees from annuity and investment type products to continue to be adversely impacted while revenues from insurance fees on variable life products would be expected to rise if average separate account asset levels continue to decline 
a million increase in international is largely due to the acquisition of hidalgo and the acquisitions in chile  partially offset by a decrease in spain due to the cessation of product lines offered through a joint venture with banco santander central hispano  sa  banco santander in a million increase in institutional is principally due to a fee related to the renegotiation of a portion of a bank owned life insurance contract  as well as growth in existing business in the group universal life product 
net investment income increased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period

these variances are partially offset by decreases of i million  or  in income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  ii million  or  in income on other invested assets  and iii million  or  in income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests 
the increase in income from fixed maturities to  million in from  million in is largely due to a higher asset base  primarily resulting from increased cash flows from sales of insurance and the acquisitions in mexico and chile 
in addition  securities lending income was higher due to increased activity and a more favorable cost of funds 
the increases in income from fixed maturities are partially offset by decreases resulting from lower reinvestment rates and a decline in bond prepayment fees 
the increase in income from real estate and real estate joint ventures held for investment to million in from million in is primarily due to the transfer of the company s one madison avenue  new york property from a company use property to an investment property in the increase in income on mortgage loans on real estate to  million in from  million in is due primarily to a higher asset base from new loan production  partially offset by lower mortgage rates 
the increase in interest income from policy loans to million in from million in is largely due to increased loans outstanding 
the decrease in income from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to million in from million in is due to declining interest rates coupled with a decrease in the asset base 
the decrease in net investment income from other invested assets to million in from million in is largely due to lower derivative income  partially offset by an increase in reinsurance contracts funds withheld at interest 
the decline in income from equity securities and other limited partnership interests to million in from million in primarily resulted from lower dividend income from equity securities  partially offset by higher limited corporate partnership distributions 
the increase in net investment income is attributable to increases in the international  individual and reinsurance segments  partially offset by decreases in corporate other  and the institutional and auto home segments

auto home decreased million primarily due to lower reinvestment rates 
other revenues decreased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this variance is primarily attributable to decreases in the individual  institutional and asset management segments  partially offset by an increase in corporate other 
individual decreased by million resulting from lower commission and fee income associated with decreased volume in the broker dealer and other subsidiaries as a result of the depressed equity markets 
a million decrease in institutional is primarily due to a million reduction in administrative fees as a result of the company s exit from the large market k business in late  as well as lower fees earned on investments in separate accounts resulting generally from poor equity market performance 
this reduction is partially offset by a million increase in group insurance due to growth in the administrative service businesses and a settlement received in related to the company s former medical business 
a million decrease in asset management is primarily due to the sale of conning in july these variances were partially offset by an increase of million in corporate other principally due to the sale of a company occupied building and income earned on corporate owned life insurance coli purchased during  partially offset by an increase in the elimination of intersegment activity

the company believes its policy of netting related policyholder amounts against investment gains and losses provides important information in evaluating its performance 
investment gains and losses are often excluded by investors when evaluating the overall financial performance of insurers 
the company believes its presentation enables readers to easily exclude investment gains and losses and the related effects on the consolidated statements of income when evaluating its performance 
the company s presentation of investment gains and losses  net of policyholder amounts  may be different from the presentation used by other insurance companies and  therefore  amounts in its consolidated statements of income may not be comparable to amounts reported by other insurers 
policyholder benefits and claims increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this variance is attributable to increases in the international  institutional and reinsurance segments  partially offset by a decrease in the auto home segment 
a million increase in international is primarily due to the acquisition of hidalgo  the acquisitions in chile and brazil  the aforementioned sale of an annuity contract  the restructuring of a canadian pension contract and business growth in south korea  mexico excluding hidalgo  taiwan and spain

an increase in reinsurance of million is commensurate with the growth in premiums discussed above 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the auto home segment 
the variance in auto home is largely due to improved claim frequency resulting from milder winter weather  lower catastrophe levels and fewer personal umbrella claims  partially offset by an increase in current year bodily injury and no fault severities and costs associated with the processing of the new york assigned risk business 
interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this variance is attributable to decreases in the individual and institutional segments  partially offset by increases in the international and reinsurance segments 
a million decrease in individual is primarily due to the establishment in of a policyholder liability with respect to certain group annuity contracts at new england financial 
excluding this policyholder liability  interest credited expense increased slightly in response to an increase in policyholder account balances  which is primarily attributable to sales growth despite declines in interest crediting rates 
an million decrease in institutional is primarily due to a decline in average crediting rates resulting from the current interest rate environment 
these variances are partially offset by a net increase of million in international 
this increase is principally due to the acquisition of hidalgo  partially offset by a reduction in the number of investment type policies in force in argentina 
in addition  a million increase in reinsurance is primarily due to several new deferred annuity reinsurance agreements executed during policyholder dividends decreased by million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period

an increase of million in international expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of hidalgo  the acquisitions in chile and brazil  as well as business growth in south korea  mexico excluding hidalgo  and hong kong 
an increase in corporate other of million is primarily due to increases in legal and interest expenses 
the period includes a million charge to increase the company s asbestos related liability and expenses to cover costs associated with the resolution of federal government investigations of general american s former medicare business 
these increases are partially offset by a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of to cover costs associated with the resolution of class action lawsuits and a regulatory inquiry pending against metropolitan life involving alleged race conscious insurance underwriting practices prior to the increase in interest expenses is primarily due to increases in long term debt resulting from the issuance of billion and billion of senior debt in november and december  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper in in addition  a decrease in the elimination of intersegment activity contributed to the variance 
a decrease of million in institutional is due to higher expenses resulting from the business realignment initiatives accrual in the fourth quarter primarily the company s exit from the large market k business  million of which was released into income in the fourth quarter of this decrease is partially offset by an increase in operational expenses for dental and disability and group insurance s non deferrable expenses commensurate with the aforementioned premium growth  as well as higher pension and post retirement benefit expenses 
a decrease of million in individual is due to continued expense management initiatives  including reduced compensation related expenses  a decline in business realignment expenses that were incurred in and reductions in volume related commission expenses in the broker dealer and other subsidiaries 
these declines are partially offset by higher pension and post retirement benefit expenses and an increase in expenses stemming from sales growth in new annuity and investment type products

a million increase in reinsurance is commensurate with the increase in allowances paid 
a million increase in individual is due to higher sales of annuity and investment type products  resulting in higher commissions and other deferrable expenses 
a million increase in international is primarily due to the acquisition of hidalgo and overall business growth in south korea  partially offset by a decrease in argentina due to the reduction in business caused by the overall economic environment

litigation 
various litigation claims and assessments against the company have arisen in the course of the company s business  including  but not limited to  in connection with its activities as an insurer  employer  investor  investment advisor and taxpayer 
further  state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations 
it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide reasonable ranges of potential losses except with respect to certain matters 
in some of the matters  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
based on management s analysis of its expected cash inflows from operating activities  the dividends it receives from subsidiaries  including metropolitan life  that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the company to make payments on debt  make dividend payments on its common stock  pay all operating expenses and meet other obligations 
the nature of the company s diverse product portfolio and customer base lessen the likelihood that normal operations will result in any significant strain on liquidity in consolidated cash flows

the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described below  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to  the following the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  including a review of all securities of the issuer  including its known subsidiaries and affiliates  regardless of the form of the company s ownership  the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies

the first two categories have generally been adversely impacted by the downturn in the financial markets  overall economic conditions and continuing effects of the september  tragedies 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve

economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk based capital formula which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of different companies businesses 
this change in methodology will be applied prospectively and will impact the level of net investment income and net income of each of the company s business segments 
a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this methodology change of allocating equity will not impact the company s consolidated net investment income or net income 
risk measurement  sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts other financial instruments  based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the company does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets  earnings and cash flows as follows fair values 
the company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change increase or decrease in the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates  and the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices 
earnings and cash flows 
metlife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate change increase or decrease in market rates and equity prices 
the following factors were incorporated into the earnings and cash flows sensitivity analyses the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities  the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities  the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each change increase or decrease in the interest rates  and the expected turnover sales of fixed maturities and equity securities  including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset liability management personnel 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  and in addition  the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the company s equity price sensitive positions at december  and is set forth in the table below 
the potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s portfolio  all of which is non trading  for the periods indicated was december  dollars in millions interest rate risk   equity price risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the change in potential loss in fair value related to market risk exposure between december  and was primarily attributable to a shift in the yield curve
