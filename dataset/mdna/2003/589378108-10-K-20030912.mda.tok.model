item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results in this report  as well as oral statements made by mercury  phrases that are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect mercury s future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position 
these statements are based on mercury s current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which mercury can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and mercury undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include certain factors identified in the following discussion as well as the risk factors appearing in item in this annual report on form k 
overview mercury designs  manufactures and markets high performance  real time digital signal and image processing computer systems that transform sensor generated data into information which can be displayed as images for human interpretation or subjected to additional computer analysis 
these multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable  allowing them to accommodate several microprocessor types and to scale from a few to hundreds of microprocessors within a single system 
during the past several years  the majority of mercury s revenue has been generated from sales of its products to the defense electronics market  generally for use in intelligence gathering electronic warfare systems 
mercury s activities in this area have focused on the proof of concept  development and deployment of advanced military applications in radar  sonar and airborne surveillance 
medical imaging is another primary market currently served by mercury 
mercury s computer systems are embedded in magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  and digital cardiology imaging machines 
the remaining revenues are derived from computer systems used in such commercial oem solutions as semiconductor photomask generation  wafer inspection  baggage scanning  seismic analysis and development of new reticle inspection and wafer inspection systems 
mercury uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the defense electronics markets in the us  japan  and europe 
defense electronics sales in other countries are achieved through distributors 
mercury also uses a direct sales force to sell its computer systems to the us and international medical imaging markets 
mercury sells its products to oems  value added resellers and end users 
on april   mercury completed its acquisition of myriad logic  inc myriad 
myriad is a leading developer of i o technology based in silver spring  maryland 
the acquisition of myriad expanded mercury s capability to provide more of a total system solution and provide more system integration services 
the total purchase price of million consisted of million in cash plus million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  mercury recorded approximately million of goodwill and million of acquired intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates mercury has identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding its business and its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on its business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such polices affect its reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires mercury to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  mercury evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  the valuation of inventory  long lived assets and income tax assets  and warranties  contingencies and litigation 
mercury bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
certain contracts with customers require the company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the company s published product specifications and  on occasion  with additional customer requested specifications 
in these cases  the company conducts such tests and  if they are completed successfully  includes a written confirmation with each order shipped 
as a result  at the time of each product shipment  the company believes that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non acceptance by its customer 
in the rare instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility  the company does not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed  and written confirmation from the customer has been received 
the company does not provide its customers with rights of product return  other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment 
installation of the company s products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the company s products and may be performed by its customers or other vendors 
if an order includes installation or training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment  the company defers revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided 
the company determines these fair values based on the price typically charged to its customers who purchase these services separately 
in limited circumstances  the company engages in long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment 
for these contracts  the company recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  measuring progress towards completion based on contract cost incurred to date as compared with total estimated contract costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials  and the availability of subcontractor services and materials 
the company s estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers  program managers and other personnel  who review each long term contract monthly to assess the contract s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
for transactions involving the licensing of stand alone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product  the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the software has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by the company or significant modification or customization of the software 
the fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
at the time of product shipment  the company assesses collectibility of trade receivables based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if the company determines that collectibility of a particular sale is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon receipt of payment from the customer 
after the time of sale  the company assesses its exposure to changes in its customers abilities to pay outstanding receivables and records allowances for such potential bad debts 
inventory inventory  which includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  the company uses consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value 
the company records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory in excess of estimated usage 
the excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
if actual demand  product mix or possible alternative uses are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually and of acquired intangible assets  property and equipment and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important that could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to prior operating results projections  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the asset or the strategy for the company s overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when the company determines that the carrying value of acquired intangible assets  property and equipment or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by its management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in its current business model 
income tax assets the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of the company s net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the company believes that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet its expectations of future income 
warranty accrual the company s product sales include a one year hardware warranty 
at time of product shipment  the company accrues for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products 
estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions

oem solutions revenues increased or million to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased shipments of high throughput baggage scanning applications as well as increased shipments to semiconductor imaging oems for developing and testing of new semiconductor imaging systems 
mercury expects oem business solutions revenues to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of design wins within the semiconductor business 
gross margin gross margin was for fiscal an increase of points from the gross margin achieved during fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher revenue volumes in fiscal compared to fiscal  which absorbed certain fixed manufacturing costs  and increased defense electronics sales  which carry a higher gross margin

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the fair value of the company s cash and investment portfolio at june  approximated carrying value due to the short term duration 
interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for issues contained in the investment portfolio 
the resulting hypothetical fair value would not be materially different from the year end carrying value 
the company s mortgage note agreements have fixed interest rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates impacts the fair value of the mortgage notes payable but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
interest rate risk was estimated as the potential change in fair value from a hypothetical increase and decrease in interest rates 
the hypothetical fair value would not be materially different from the year end carrying value 
foreign currency risk the company operates primarily in the united states
