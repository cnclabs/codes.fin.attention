the cost of the transaction has been allocated on the basis of the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the transactions have been accounted for as purchases  and their respective financial results have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of their respective transactions 
in july  ansoft announced its formation of altra broadband to pursue the development of critical intellectual property and products for broadband wireless and optical communications 
in spite of certain technical successes  profitable deployment of intellectual property developed by altra broadband s irvine technology center in this telecom environment was deemed unlikely in the near term 
as such  the company closed the irvine technology center during the quarter ended october   resulting in a restructuring charge of  that is included in research and development expense 
the restructuring was committed to and completed in the quarter ended october  the total  restructuring charge was comprised of a  charge for the impairment of fixed assets included in the cash flow statement and a charge of  for the remaining lease obligations for which a liability was recorded as of october  the impairment charge was based on third party offers to purchase the remaining assets 
critical accounting policies ansoft s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of accounts receivable impairment of long lived assets impairment of marketable securities available for sale deferred tax asset valuation allowance revenue recognition revenue consists of fees for licenses of software products and service and other revenue 
license revenue ansoft licenses its software on a perpetual basis with no right to return or exchange the licensed software 
postcontract customer support pcs is bundled with the perpetual licensing fee 
revenue related to the three month pcs is deferred and recognized ratably over the three month term 
ansoft s vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for the three month pcs is based upon the pricing for comparable transactions when the element is sold separately 
ansoft s vsoe for the three month pcs is based upon one fourth of the customer s annual maintenance contract renewal rates 
three month pcs services provided are the same as maintenance 
during the year ended april   the company changed the pcs period bundled with the perpetual license from a one year period to a three month period to more closely align our pricing policy with other vendors within our industry 
in addition  we no longer believed we could continue to expect future releases offered to customers under three month pcs would only contain enhancements limited to bug fixes covered by warranty provisions and therefore the company began deferring the pcs in fiscal prior to fiscal  the company recognized pcs revenue together with the licensing fee on delivery of the software if collectibility of the resulting receivable was probable  enhancements were limited to bug fixes covered by warranty provisions  and the costs of providing these services were expected to be insignificant 
pursuant to this policy  there were no deferred amounts recorded prior to fiscal and the estimated costs of providing pcs were accrued at the time of revenue recognition 
service and other revenue consists primarily of maintenance revenue 
ansoft offers customers one year maintenance contracts at of the list price of the respective software products 
ansoft recognizes all maintenance revenue ratably over the respective maintenance period 
customers renew maintenance agreements annually 
revenue from customer training  support and other services is recognized as the service is performed 
valuation of accounts receivable management reviews accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection

the allowance for doubtful accounts as of april  and was  and  respectively 
the increase in allowance in fiscal was primarily due to the overall business environment of our customers 
in fiscal the allowance was increased  due primarily due to the overall increase in ansoft s receivable balance as of april   and to a lesser extent  the overall business environment of our customers 
no particular customer was a cause of the changes in allowances 
we had no significant changes in our collection policies or payment terms 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
impairment of marketable securities available for sale an impairment charge is recorded if a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance has been established 
the judgments used in applying the above policies are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from those estimates
