item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview shurgard storage centers  inc is a reit headquartered in seattle  washington  specializing in all aspects of the self storage industry 
as of december   we operated a network of storage centers and two business parks located throughout the united states and in europe 
of these properties  we own or lease  directly and through our subsidiaries  joint ventures and european investment  operating properties containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
of the operating properties  are located in states in the us and are located in europe 
we also manage for third parties  self storage centers containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
self storage properties offer low cost  easily accessible storage space for personal and business uses 
our investment objective is to maximize shareholder value through internal growth and through the acquisition and development of additional self storage properties 
we believe that the experience of our management team in acquiring  developing and operating self storage properties  our geographic diversification and our emphasis on quality will enhance our ability to achieve this objective 
our mission is to be the global leader in storage products and services 
we believe we can obtain this goal by focusing on providing exceptional customer service and the highest quality products to our customers 
during  we opened or acquired domestic storage centers directly or through joint ventures 
additionally  our european investment opened developments during as part of our focus on providing the highest quality products to our customers  we look for locations that are in populated retail areas 
when entering a market  to create customer awareness  we seek dominant locations within specific three to five mile trade areas that are highly visible and accessible in retail corridors 
through multiple locations of this kind within a metropolitan area  we establish brand recognition as well as economies of scale in operating our stores 
in most markets  we seek to own at least stores in order to realize these efficiencies 
to further enhance brand recognition  we strive to achieve a uniform look to our properties through the use of signage  color schemes  quality of the building and our trademark lighthouse office design in new developments 
the following discussion of operations provides comparative financial information and discussion of each of the areas of growth  including segment performance  ownership and leasing arrangements  european operations and other real estate investments 
also included is a discussion of capital expenditures  financing transactions  off balance sheet transactions  short and long term liquidity and funds from operations 
when used in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the words believes  anticipates  projects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding financial performance 
actual results may differ materially due to uncertainties including the risk that changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  and or competition from new self storage facilities or other storage alternatives may cause rent to decline and may cause occupancy rates to drop  or may cause delays in rent up of newly developed properties  the risk that new developments could be delayed or reduced by zoning and permitting requirements outside of our control  increased competition for desirable sites  construction delays due to weather  unforeseen site conditions  labor shortages  personnel turnover  scheduling problems with contractors  subcontractors or suppliers  and the risk that we may experience increases in the cost of labor  taxes  marketing and other operating and construction expenses  and the risk that tax law changes may change the taxability of operating and construction expenses  and the risk that tax law changes may change the taxability of future income and increases in interest rates may increase the cost of refinancing long term debt  and our alternatives for funding our business plan may be impaired by the economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism  and our interest in shurgard europe may be adversely impacted if that entity is unable to complete formation and funding of its contemplated development joint ventures 
we may also be affected by legislation or changes in regulations or interpretations regarding certain accounting standards applied to our operations and certain existing financial and joint venture structures of the company 
other factors that could affect our financial results are described below and in item business of annual report on form k 
forward l ooking statements are based on estimates as of the date of this report 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements reflecting new estimates  events or circumstances after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of shurgard and our subsidiaries 
all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation 
we consolidate the accounts of those subsidiaries or joint ventures in which we have effective control as evidenced by  among other factors  a majority interest in the investment and the ability to cause a sale of assets 
all investments in joint ventures that do not qualify for consolidation  but in which we exercise significant influence and do not have effective control  are accounted for under the equity method and are included in other real estate investments 
derivatives we evaluate the effectiveness of derivatives at inception and on a quarterly basis for those hedges that do not qualify for the use of the short cut method 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
we are also hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions in connection with the purchase option for properties in the tax retention operating lease 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
financing arrangements we accounted for sales of certain storage centers in which we have continuing involvement  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  as financing arrangements see note h to our consolidated financial statements 
we use the effective interest rate method using estimated future cash flows in determining the amortization of participation rights 
this estimate is evaluated each period and is sensitive to both amount and timing of cash flows and projected purchase price 
estimated amount and timing of distributions is based on projected property operating cash flows 
estimated amount and timing of purchase price is based on projected stabilized net operating income and our estimate of when each property will reach stabilization 
during  we reduced the participation rights for ccp shurgard million based on our re evaluation of the projected cash flows of these prope rties and the projected timing of our joint venture partner s exercise of their put option 
this reduction in participation rights was accounted for as a change in estimate and will reduce amortization of participation rights in future periods 
deferred tax asset shurgard trs inc shurgard trs  a wholly owned subsidiary  is a taxable reit subsidiary and is subject to corporate level tax 
stg  shurgard preferred partners  ss income plan and storage line management are wholly owned subsidiaries of shurgard trs 
these entities have accumulated tax losses primarily attributable to net operating loss carryforwards from stg that will expire beginning in  temporary differences in fixed assets and operating losses see note l to our consolidated financial statements 
when determining the necessary amount  if any  of valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  we estimate projected future taxable income from all sources to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax asset in its entirety 
no valuation allowance has been recorded for segment performance when managing our real estate assets  we evaluate performance in two segments 
the first segment  same stores  represents those storage centers and business parks that are not in the rent up stage and for which historical information is available 
the second segment  new stores  represents those storage centers recently acquired or developed for which performance is measured primarily based on original investment expectations 
we evaluate all stores on the same basis regardless of ownership interest in the property 
the following sections discuss the performance of these segments for domestic properties 
same stores in  we continued our focus on increasing net operating income noi from our existing real estate assets 
the primary way we analyze our performance is to measure year over year improvements in same store operating results 
our definition of same stores includes existing stores acquired prior to january of the previous year as well as developed properties that have been operating for a full two years as of january of the current year 
please note that our definition of same stores results in the addition of stores each year as new acquisitions and developments meet the criteria for inclusion  and that we then include these stores in the previous year s comparable data 
other storage companies may define same stores differently  which will affect the comparability of the data 
the following table summarizes same store operating performance as defined at december  and 
imagegif 
table includes the total operating results of each store regardless of our percentage ownership interest in that store 
includes all direct property and real estate tax expense 
does not include any allocation of indirect expense 
indirect operating expense includes certain shared property costs such as bank fees  district and corporate management  purchasing  national contracts personnel and marketing  as well as certain overhead costs allocated to property operations such as business information technology  legal services  human resources and accounting 
does not include internal real estate acquisition cost or abandoned development expense 
indirect operating expense is allocated to stores based on number of months in operation during the period 
indirect operating and leasehold expense includes leasehold expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average annual rent per square foot is calculated by dividing actual rent collected by the average number of square feet occupied during the period 
noi has risen over the last three years due to increases in revenue  which is a function of changes in rental rates and occupancy 
while the storage business is seasonal  spring and summer being peak occupancy periods  the year over year trends from to reflect general market changes 
revenue gains from to resulted from rate increases and were offset by occupancy decreases while the gain from to resulted primarily from rate increases 
during  we experienced a decrease in demand evidenced by a decrease in recorded inquiries at the stores 
occupancies dropped two and half percentage points from january through april and  in order to stop this erosion  we began to make rate concessions 
although the average rate for the year is up  quarterly trends show that this increase is the result of a increase in the first quarter followed by a slow erosion of rates from may through december 
despite these rate adjustments  our seasonal occupancy increase that normally occurs over late spring and summer was not as significant as most years and we continued to lag occupancy levels 
although we believe that the quality of our storage centers as well as our geographic diversity helps mitigate the impact to us of competition in individual markets  like most other businesses  we are subject to the effects of general economic conditions 
we believe that the downward pressure in both occupancies and rates in many of ou r markets is due to economic conditions and rate reductions being offered by various competitors as they attempt to compensate for these market factors 
despite the declining trends during  we have begun to see some encouraging signs in early average rental rates rose in january and february for the first time in nine months 
additionally  for the first time in more than a year  occupancy for the month of february was higher than the previous year 
while it is still too early to conclude that these results indicate a turnaround  they are noteworthy and may signal that we are hitting the bottom of the cycle 
in response to decreasing demand and increasing competition  we have been examining our marketing and sales programs to identify areas for potential improvement 
during the spring and summer of  we reorganized our national sales center  and during  we realigned our direct sales team to achieve lower overhead and retain the highest performing representatives 
as a result of this  as well as additional training of store management personnel  abandonment ratios by our sales and customer service representatives dropped significantly during and closing ratios increased 
during the fourth quarter we began to see some recovery in our occupancy declines evidenced by a decreasing deficit over the prior year  from basis points in the first quarter to basis points in the fourth quarter of this allowed us to increase rates in some of our markets which reduced the rate deterioration we had been experiencing during direct operating expenses increased from to  consistent with the change from to this increase in direct operating expenses in compared to was primarily due to increases in personnel  real estate taxes and cost of goods sold offset by decreases in utilities 
direct operating expenses increased from to as the expenditures for marketing and sales campaigns implemented during annualized 
additionally  decreased indirect operating expenses resulted in an increase in noi after indirect costs of for compared to for this decrease in indirect expenses for is the result of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain fixed costs over a greater number of stores  as well as holding total indirect expenses flat during the decrease from to is the result of economies of scale realized by operating a larger number of stores in  as well as increased marketing  sales and technology expenses incurred during that leveled off during our definition of indirect operating expense includes certain shared property costs such as bank fees  district and corporate management  purchasing  national contracts personnel and marketing  as well as certain overhead costs allocated to property operations such as business information technology  legal services  human resources and accounting 
we believe that  given the current economic environment  revenue growth will be in the to range with expense growth at approximately  resulting in noi growth in the to range 
these expectations regarding growth constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act and are based on several assumptions 
if any of these assumptions are not satisfied or prove to be incorrect  actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may cause these assumptions and this forward looking statement to prove to be incorrect include the risks that implementation of the business plan  including marketing and sales initiatives  will not be successful and that our earnings  expenses or revenues may be affected by other factors  such as the risk that changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  competition from new self storage facilities or other storage alternatives may cause rents to decline  and may cause occupancy rates to drop  or may cause delays in rent up of newly developed properties 
the risk that new developments could be delayed or reduced  the risk that we may experience increases in the cost of labor  taxes  marketing and other operating and construction expenses and the risk that tax law changes may change the taxability of future income and increases in interest rates may increase the cost of refinancing long term debt  and our alternatives for funding our business plan may be impaired by the economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism  and our interest in shurgard europe may be adversely impacted if that entity i s unable to complete formation and funding of its contemplated development joint ventures 
we may also be affected by pending legislation or changes in regulations or interpretations regarding certain accounting standards applied to our operations and certain of our existing financial and joint venture structures 
new stores our definition of new stores  as shown in the table below  includes existing domestic facilities that had not been acquired or leased as of january of the previous year as well as domestic developed properties that have not been operating a full two years as of january of the current year

increases from year to year in noi for the new store portfolio reflect the greater number of properties and  correspondingly  property months for the periods presented 
although this increase gives some indication of how much of our overall noi growth results from new stores  we do not regard it as a good method of evaluating the performance of assets within this segment 
rather  we use other methods  including primarily comparisons of actual results to targeted noi for the appropriate period from opening or at maturity 
the performance of our domestic acquisitions and developments are discussed in the sections that follow 
domestic acquisitions we continue to seek acquisition opportunities for high quality storage centers that meet our investment standards 
we typically target our acquisitions to generate a yield of to once they have reached stabilization 
we have limited our efforts to pursue only those storage centers that enhance our existing network of stores or allow us to establish significant market presence in new markets ie establish greater market presence or expand an established market to create greater economies of scale 
the operating results of our acquisitions are discussed below 
the following table summarizes our acquisition activity from to 
imagegif 
during  we purchased four individual storage centers totaling  net rentable square feet for million 
these properties are in the following locations two in indiana  one in maryland and one in florida 
the average occupancy of these stores is 
the december yield on these four storage centers is calculated as december noi annualized divided by the purchase price 
additionally  we began leasing an additional four storage centers through the tax retention operating lease facility totaling  net rentable square feet 
these properties are in the following locations one in indiana  one in california  one in illinois and one in florida 
the average occupancy of these stores is  which is below our projected stabilized occupancy as all of these stores were newly built and are still in rent up 
although renting up slower than expected  we believe that general economic conditions are contributing to this and we still expect them to reach projected returns 
on june   we purchased for million a interest in morningstar storage centers  llc morningstar  which owns and operates storage centers in north carolina and south carolina that consist of  net rentable square feet 
the existing storage centers include seven sites with pre identified expansion opportunities and nine sites with continued development potential 
we have also entered into an agreement with certain members of morningstar to form one or more joint ventures for the purpose of developing and operating high quality self storage properties in north and south carolina 
the properties owned by the entity and the properties to be developed in the joint ventures will be managed by the members of morningstar through an affiliated entity 
of the stores  stores are still in rent up 
occupancy for these stores is 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements 
we have a preferential return on this portfolio that is currently yielding us calculated as our preferred return divided by the purchase price 
during  we purchased four storage centers totaling  net rentable square feet for million 
two of these properties are located in california and two are in michigan 
the december yield on the four properties we purchased is calculated as december noi divided by the purchase price 
additionally  in we began leasing an additional four storage centers totaling  net rentable square feet located in florida  california  illinois and michigan 
three of the four properties leased were leased through the tax retention operating lease and one of these properties was acquired through a long term lease of the land and building 
the three properties leased through the tax retention operating lease averaged occupied at december  one of these stores is facing stronger than expected competition and  as a result  is renting up significantly slower than expected 
during  we purchased stores for million one of which is located in california and six of which are located in texas 
we sold one of these stores in as of december   occupancy in the remaining six stores averaged and rates averaged 
these properties have a december yield of calculated as december noi annualized divided by the purchase price  which is greater than projected at the time of purchase 
the operating results of the acquisitions are included in same store results for and in new store results for we can give no assurance that the projections noted above regarding the acquisitions will occur 
actual occupancy levels and rates could be lower if we experience competition from other self storage properties and other storage alternatives in close proximity to our storage centers 
actual yields may also be lower if major expenses such as property taxes  labor and marketing  among others  increase more than projected 
see risk factors in item business of this annual report on form k 
domestic development our long term growth plan includes development of new storage centers in markets in which we currently operate 
this is primarily due to our focus on maintaining high quality standards and consistent building design to develop brand awareness 
implementation of this development strategy through early focused on internally financed projects developed primarily through development financing joint ventures 
during  we changed to a new method of implementing this growth strategy through build to suit  tax retention operating leases under which we have an option to purchase the related properties see tax retention operating leases under off balance sheet transactions 
the following table summarizes our domestic development activity from to

we typically target yields for developments at to 
yield is calculated as projected annualized noi divided by the total invested cost 
we can give no assurance that the projections noted above regarding the development projects will occur 
actual occupancy levels and rates could be lower if we experience competition from other self storage properties and other storage alternatives in close proximity to our developments 
actual yields may also be lower if major expenses such as property taxes  labor and marketing  among others  increase more than projected

as a result of the addition of new joint venture development partners  and the business trends and economic conditions that we are experiencing in some of our markets  during we reduced our internal development staff by fourteen 
we opened thirteen domestic storage centers during  and  when all phases are complete  these projects will total approximately  net rentable square feet with an estimated total cost of million 
all but one of these stores was developed through the tax retention operating leases see off balance sheet transactions 
of the thirteen stores opened in  four of these were developed through the tax retention operating leases see tax retention operating leases under off balance sheet transactions  one was developed through our florida joint venture  one was developed through our oklahoma joint venture and the remaining seven were developed by shurgard directly 
the developments together generated million in noi for the months of for the month of december  these developments had noi of  which represents of projected monthly noi at maturity  and averaged occupancy after an average of months of operations 
three of the storage centers opened in were developed through our tennessee and florida joint ventures 
additionally  were developed by shurgard and contributed to ccp shurgard venture  llc ccp shurgard 
the developments together generated million in noi for the months of of these stores  nine opened in the fourth quarter of for the month of december  these developments had noi of  which represents of projected monthly noi at maturity  and averaged occupancy after an average of months of operations 
these stores are facing strong competition in their markets and are leasing up slower than expected  resulting in revenues for that were approximately million below budget 
additionally  many of these stores have experienced higher than anticipated expenses primarily in the category of real estate taxes 
we are aggressively contesting these through appeals 
although we expect to be able to reach our revenue goals for these propertie s in the long run  our stabilized yield will be below the targeted yield if we are unsuccessful in our real estate tax appeals 
ownership and leasing arrangements we have various ownership and leasing arrangements with respect to properties included in our same store and new store portfolios 
the table below includes information as of and for the year ended december  that identifies the proportion of same store and new store results attributable to each of these various arrangements 
the following tables include of the cost  operating results and other information presented regardless of our percentage ownership interest in that property 
each of the categories presented is discussed in greater detail in sections following the table

wholly owned or leased substantially all of our storage centers are owned directly or through wholly owned subsidiaries 
additionally  as of december   we operate properties that are subject to land or building leases requiring non contingent rent payments 
development financing joint ventures in order to expand our development capacity  broaden our access to capital and minimize the effect of the rent up deficit on funds from operations ffo  see funds from operations  we have pursued alternative financing options 
in connection with this initiative  we formed four joint ventures  sfpi in may with fremont storage partners i  sfpii in march with fremont storage partners ii  shurgard k s i  llc in october with k s storage  llc and ccp shurgard  as referenced above  in may with an affiliate of jp morgan partners 
under these joint venture agreements  we constructed storage centers financed through the use of cash flows provided by operations and our line of credit and  on completion  contributed those storage centers to the joint ventures 
at the time of contribution  we were reimbursed to the extent our historical cost plus negative cash flow prior to the transfer exceeded our pro rata portion of required equity calculat ed as total required funding less amounts provided from financial institutions multiplied by our ownership percentage 
we either retain an option to purchase the storage centers from the joint venture or the joint venture has a right to put those storage centers to us at a future date 
the purchase price is calculated as the greater of a that amount necessary to provide a specified return on the partners contributed capital in the case of ccp shurgard or b annualized noi divided by 
as a result of this option or put  we have continuing involvement with these joint ventures and do not recognize the contribution of the storage centers as a transfer in ownership for financial reporting purposes 
we account for these joint ventures as financing arrangements and  as such  recognize all activities related to those properties in our financial statements 
additionally we recognize a participation rights liability and a related discount on the underlying liability for the estimated fair value of ou r partners share of the estimated option purchase price 
the discount is amortized over the term of the related agreement 
during  we exercised our option to acquire our joint venture partner s interest in three of the four joint ventures for a total of million 
these were accounted for as a reduction in participation rights liability 
as of december   we include the operations of storage centers owned through ccp shurgard  a joint venture in which we own a legal interest 
due to the details of the property contribution and purchase option related to this joint venture described above  we account for this joint venture as a financing arrangement and include all of the operating results of the properties in our financial statements 
these properties are subject to million in mortgage debt 
during  we re evaluated our estimate of the option price  the projected timing of our joint venture partner s exercise of their put option and the related expected cash flows 
these changes were accounted for as a change in estimate  reduced gross participation rights  and subsequent amortization of participation rights 
the effect of this change in estimate decreased gross participation rights by million and increased income before extraordinary items and net income by million in by red ucing amortization from the comparable amount 
the following is a summary of the participation rights balances for the years ended december  and

consolidated joint ventures we operate four storage centers owned through a joint venture with a california developer 
under our agreement with this developer  it purchases sites in southern california and constructs storage centers on them according to our specifications 
on completion of the rent up period  the storage centers are purchased by a joint venture 
prior to such purchase  we have no ownership in the properties and accordingly  they are not included in any discussions in our operating results 
the developer s interest in the joint venture is based on a predetermined formula and the fair value of the property at contribution 
during  the joint venture purchased one of the completed storage centers for million  during the joint venture purchased an additional completed storage center for million  and during  the joint venture purchased two of the completed storage centers for million 
at december   we had guaranteed million in outstanding debt for three properties related to this agreement 
additionally  we have two partnerships with institutional investors that own storage centers and two joint ventures that own two storage centers 
our ownership in these joint ventures ranges from to 
included in our consolidated financial statements is our purchase of a interest in morningstar  which owns storage centers in north and south carolina 
this acquisition was made on june   and the results of operations of these storage centers are included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on that date 
we have entered into an agreement with morningstar members to form one or more joint ventures for the purpose of developing and operating high quality self storage properties in north and south carolina 
the properties owned by the entity and the properties to be developed in the joint ventures will be managed by the members of morningstar through an affiliated entity using shurgard management systems and standards 
at the time of the purchase of morningstar  we entered into a management services agreement with morningstar property management  llc 
they will manage the properties in north carolina and south carolina for a property management fee equal to the greater of  per property or of the gross revenues of each property 
unconsolidated joint ventures the properties in unconsolidated joint ventures have been developed primarily through our florida and tennessee joint ventures 
our ownership interests range from to  and we do not exercise effective control because all major decisions require the agreement of both parties 
these joint ventures have assets with a gross book value of million and debt of million secured by the storage centers 
our pro rata ownership in the assets is million and our pro rata interest in the debt of these joint ventures is million  million of which debt we have guaranteed

the actual completed cost of these projects could vary due to delays during construction caused by weather  unforeseen site conditions  labor shortages  personnel turnover  scheduling problems with contractors  subcontractors or suppliers  or resource constraints 
includes amounts for which we have not yet been reimbursed as construction agent 
we have subleased the operations of one property to a third party in which we have no ownership 
therefore  the operating results of this property are not included in our discussion of operating properties 
we have subcontracted out the construction agent responsibilities for of these properties to an affiliate 
we have subcontracted out the construction agent responsibilities for of these properties to an affiliate 
as of december  we leased properties under a leasing arrangement see tax retention operating leases under off balance sheet transactions that terminates in february each lease includes a purchase option and a residual lease guarantee 
as of december   we are operating of these storage centers and have subleased the operations of one additional storage center to a third party 
we are engaged as construction agent on properties that are under construction with an additional three properties under construction for which we have subcontracted the construction management to an affiliate 
as of december   the operating properties under the tax retention operating leases had total net rentable square feet of million 
excluding the one property subleased to a third party  these properties generated million in revenue in and noi of  which is approximately and ahead of pro forma for these stores for  respectively 
these properties had an average of occupancy  with a rate of per square foot after an average of seven months of operations 
in december  we exercised our purchase option on three of the leased properties 
during december  these three properties generated  in noi which represents of projected monthly noi at maturity 
the yield on these three properties is projected to average during  as two of these properties are still in rent up 
during we entered into three swaps to hedge the interest rate fluctuations of the projected cash flow associated with the future exercise of the purchase option for a portion of the properties in the tax retention operating lease 
the swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value and adjusted each period through other comprehensive income 
as of december   our liability under the swaps is million 
european operations european business summary european operations are conducted through shurgard self storage  sca shurgard europe  a joint venture in which we have a combined direct and indirect equity interest 
at december   shurgard europe was operating in belgium  sweden  france  the netherlands  the united kingdom and denmark 
since  shurgard europe has tested the self storage product on local consumers and has tailored its product to meet the needs of european consumers 
european consumers tend to live in more crowded population densities and smaller living spaces that make self storage an attractive option 
the self storage industry is not well established in much of europe  and we believe this presents shurgard europe with the opportunity to become a dominant player throughout western europe 
although we are seeing other industry players entering the european markets  we believe that the supply being added to the market still leaves significant opportunity when compared to the overall size of the market 
shurgard europe and its subsidiaries have established expansion plans that focus now in five markets the benelux region which includes belgium  luxembourg and the netherlands  france  scandinavia including sweden and denmark  the uk  and more recently germany 
in order to take advantage of the market opportunity  shurgard europe continues to expand in europe 
although the operations of existing stores are improving  this expansion will produce losses for the next two to three years as financing costs  start up losses from the additional stores and overhead costs necessary to carry out current expansion plans will continue to exceed operating income 
the results of european operations are not consolidated in our financial statements  but rather our interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence over its operations through our control of of the board of managers 
the data included in the following discussion and tables reflect total european operations  not our pro rata percentage 
our net loss from european operations  including our interest in recom co 
see off balance sheet transactions  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these results are reported under expenses as loss from other real estate investments in our consolidated statement of net income 
our portion of ffo losses  including our interest in recom co  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we expect to increase our ownership interest to just over see off balance sheet transactions

in november  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  see note v to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which amended sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no

fasb interpretation no 
becomes effective for us beginning july it is reasonably possible that we will be considered the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities created prior to february   on adoption of fasb interpretation no

see note h to our consolidated financial statements 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  pursuant to the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit october  as amended in april  white paper on funds from operations  is defined as net income  calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap including non recurring events  except for those defined as extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property  plus depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of intangible assets exclusive of deferred financing costs less dividends paid to preferred shareholders 
we believe that because amortization of participation rights discount reflect our partners increasing interests in unrecognized gains on depreciable operating properties represented by the difference between the expected option price and our partners contributions  it is consistent to add it back to net income 
contributions to ffo from unconsolidated entities in which the reporting e ntity holds an active interest are to be reflected in ffo on the same basis 
we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net income because net income implicitly assumes that the value of assets diminish predictably over time while we believe that real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
ffo is not a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities or net income computed in accordance with gaap  nor should it be considered an alternative indication of our operating performance or liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define funds from operations in accordance with the nareit definition 
the following table sets forth the calculation of ffo in accordance with the nareit definition

ffo for increased million over ffo  which had increased million over as previously discussed  this growth rate reflects the improved performance of the original portfolio of properties as well as the addition of properties over the past three years through acquisitions and developments 
in  assuming we grow same store noi after indirect operating and leasehold expense at to  we directly finance new developments and we increase our interest in shurgard europe to just over  we expect ffo to increase million to million 
this expectation regarding ffo growth constitutes a forward looking statement within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act and is based on several assumptions 
if any of these assumptions are not satisfied or prove to be incorrect  actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the statement 
the risks and uncertainties that may cause these assumptions and this forward looking statement to prove to be incorrect include the risks that implementation of the business plan  including marketing and sales initiatives  will not be successful and that our earnings  expenses or revenues may be affected by other factors  such as the risk that competition from new self storage facilities or other storage alternatives may cause rents to decline  occupancy rates to drop  or delays in rent up of newly developed properties 
we may experience increases in labor  taxes  marketing and other operating and construction expenses

in addition  we have million variable rate debt on our line of credit

as of december   the option price to acquire all properties in the tax retention operating lease was million and is expected to be million when they are completely built out 
we are not obligated to exercise our option on all properties in this facility 
if we choose to exercise our option to purchase these properties  funds would be available through our existing line of credit 
we believe we have existing liquidity to finance both transactions 
we anticipate meeting our long term liquidity needs primarily through a combination of our lines of credit  unsecured debt  common and preferred equity  and alternative capital sources 
in order to continue to grow at historical rates and to meet our capital objectives  it will be necessary to obtain equity capital during the next two to three years 
we will evaluate various alternatives  including joint ventures with private institutions and public pension funds and the issuance of additional common stock 
additionally  we anticipate reducing our distribution payout ratio in order to retain cash flow for growth

we  our european operating partners and some of the shurgard europe employees have the right to increase our respective equity interests in recom  pro rata in proportion to our existing ownership  by purchasing additional shares at a euro fixed price 
for example  if we and these partners were to purchase additional interests to provide capital for repayment of the credit facility balance at december   our interest would increase to

recom has total assets of million and total liabilities of million of which we guarantee million 
recom s assets include investment in shurgard europe of million  loan to shurgard europe of million and other assets of million 
it is reasonably likely that we will be considered the primary beneficiary of recom and that we will have to consolidate the assets and liabilities of recom into shurgard s financial statements 
our maximum exposure to loss would be our contingent liability as general partner which totaled million at december  other joint ventures unconsolidated joint ventures we operate properties in unconsolidated joint ventures that have been developed primarily through our florida and tennessee joint ventures 
our ownership interests range from to  and we do not exercise effective control because all major decisions require the agreement of both parties 
these joint ventures have total assets of million and total liabilities of million 
we have guaranteed debt of million related to these joint ventures 
our maximum exposure to loss would be million  the total of these guarantees and the net book value of our investment which was million at december  shurgard europe shurgard europe is a belgian joint venture in which we own  four unaffiliated institutional investors own  our european operating partners own 
and recom owns 
our european operating partners are european entrepreneurs who worked with us in to establish the european operations and who joined us as original investors at that time 
the four institutional investors  consisting of european and us banking  insurance and real estate institutions  acquired their interests in october through a commitment to invest million euro in the joint venture 
on february   the joint venture obtained commitments from all of its owners on a pro rata basis to invest an additional million euro 
the commitments were made pro rata and  therefore  did not alter the percentage ownership of the parties 
at december   shurgard euro pe had drawn on million euro of the initial commitment from the institutional investors and had not yet drawn on any of the additional february commitment 
shurgard europe is managed by a board of managers in which we hold of the votes  our european operating partners hold and the institutional investors collectively hold 
substantially all major decisions require approval of managers holding at least of the votes 
the joint venture agreement provides that if  by december   the institutional investors have not had an opportunity to liquidate their interests through an initial public offering or a sale of all their interests  then they may initiate steps that could lead to an initial public offering or to the sale of shurgard europe or its assets in accordance with prescribed procedures 
all partners interests in shurgard europe are subject to a right of first refusal 
we  recom and our european operating partners are subject to other restrictions on transfer and sale 
the operation of these provisions could substantially affect our ownership interest in and the structure of our european investment 
shurgard europe has total assets of million and total liabilities of million including million bonds payable to us and million note payable to recom 
our maximum exposure to loss would be the balance of the bonds payable to us of million at december  we are currently evaluating the joint ventures and shurgard europe on an entity by entity basis to determine if they meet the criteria to be classified as a variable interest entity 
based on this evaluation  some or all of these entities may be consolidated in our financial statements beginning july  reit qualification and distribution requirements as a reit  we must distribute at least of our taxable income to our shareholders each year  and we generally are not required to pay federal income tax on our taxable income 
to satisfy this requirement  our distributions must be made in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if they are i declared before the reit timely files its tax return for such year and ii paid on or before the first regular distribution payment date after the date of declaration 
additionally  as a reit  we must derive at least of our total gross income from specified classes of income related to real property  distributions  interest or certain gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities 
our revenue from truck rentals  sales of locks and boxes and management services performed for other owners of properties do not qualify under this gross income test 
such non qualifying income was approximately of gross revenue in and we expect to meet the test in our acquisition of additional properties will tend to reduce the percentage of non qualifying income  while additional management contracts  including those with off balance sheet joint ventures and partnerships  and the sales of properties from the existing portfolio will tend to increase the percentage of non qualifying income 
while we intend to manage our activities so that we continue to satisfy the test in the future  we can provide no assurance that non qualifying income will not exceed in future years  which will result in a loss of reit status 
finally  in order to maintain our status as a reit  we must satisfy on a quarterly basis various tests restricting the nature of our assets 
in general  at least of our assets must consist of real estate assets  cash  cash items including receivables and government securities 
furthermore  we may not hold securities of any issuer that represent i more than of the value of our total assets or ii more than of the vote or value of the issuer s outstanding securities  and no more than of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
while we intend to manage our activities so that we continue to satisfy these asset tests in the future  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk in order to mitigate our interest rate risk  we contract with financial institutions for derivative products that help us manage this exposure 
our investment policy prohibits us from entering into any such contract solely to secure profit by speculating on the direction of currency exchange or interest rates if unrelated to capital borrowed  lent or invested by us 
therefore  changes in their values will not have a significant effect on our operations  cash flows or financial position 
we have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in the construction  acquisition  and operation of storage centers in countries outside the us to the extent such activities are financed with financial instruments or equity denominated in non functional currencies 
since all foreign debt is denominated in the corresponding functional currency  our currency exposure is limited to our equity investment in those countries 
countries in which we have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations include belgium  france  the netherlands  sweden  denmark and the united kingdom 
our gross investment in these foreign operations at december  was million and is not considered material 
at december   cumulative losses  including depreciation expense  have exceeded our gross investment by million 
during  all foreign investments are accounted for under the equity method 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including loans to shareholders  debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract
