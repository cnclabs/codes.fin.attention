item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction on july   we entered into a ten year agreement with at t broadband now known as comcast cable that allows comcast cable to provide telephone services using our network infrastructure and comcast cable s switching and transport facilities 

table of contents on august   we completed the purchase of the remaining common equity interest in insight ohio which we previously did not own 
at the same time  the insight ohio operating agreement was amended to provide us with of its total voting power 
as such  the results of insight ohio have been consolidated in our results for the years ended december   and prior to  we accounted for our non voting common equity interest in insight ohio which we acquired in august under the equity method 
on january  effective january   we completed a series of transactions with certain cable subsidiaries of at t corp 
that increased by  the number of customers we serve 
we refer in this report to these transactions  including related bank financing  as the at t transactions 
specifically  insight midwest acquired all of our systems not already owned by insight midwest  including insight ohio  serving approximately  customers  as well as systems which we acquired from the at t cable subsidiaries serving approximately  customers  and systems from the at t cable subsidiaries located in illinois serving approximately  customers 
insight midwest financed the acquisition of the systems from us and the at t cable subsidiaries by borrowing million under the midwest holdings credit facility 
results of operations revenues are earned from customer fees for cable television programming services including premium  digital and pay per view services and ancillary services  such as rental of converters and remote control devices  installations and from selling advertising 
in addition  we earn revenues from providing high speed data services and from facilitating the delivery of telephone services as well as from commissions for products sold through home shopping networks and management fees 
under our franchise agreements  we are obligated to pay to local franchising authorities a percentage of our revenue derived from providing cable and other services the majority of which are passed through to customers 
we have historically recorded revenue net of franchise fees charged to our customers 
staff announcement d  issued by the fasb in november  specifies that reimbursements received from a customer should be reflected as revenues and not as a reduction of expenses 
this staff announcement applies to financial reporting periods beginning after december  upon application of this staff announcement  comparative financial statements for prior periods are required to be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this staff announcement 
consequently  we have reclassified the prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations to reflect franchise fees on a gross basis with reimbursements as revenue and payments as expense 
the effect on the prior period statements of operations was to increase both revenue and selling  general and administrative costs by million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have generated increases in revenues and operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years  primarily through a combination of acquisitions  internal customer growth  increases in monthly revenue per customer and growth in advertising and increasingly new revenue from selling new 
table of contents services including high speed data access and interactive digital video 
as a result of our march  purchase of the remaining equity interest in sourcesuite  llc  we now own of sourcesuite s equity interests 
as such  the operating results of sourcesuite have been consolidated in the accompanying financial statements effective january  during  we accounted for our interest in sourcesuite under the equity method 
some of the principal reasons for our net losses through december  include depreciation and amortization associated with our acquisitions and capital expenditures related to the construction and upgrading of our systems  and interest costs on borrowed money 
beginning january   we no longer record amortization expense associated with goodwill and franchise costs  however  we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  continued losses will have on our ability to finance our operations in the future

we believe that ocf is commonly used in the cable television industry to analyze and compare cable television companies on the basis of operating performance  leverage and liquidity 
however  ocf is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows as a measure of liquidity  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

the cable television business has substantial on going capital requirements for the construction  expansion and maintenance of its broadband networks 
expenditures have been made for various purposes including the upgrade of our existing cable network  and in the future will be used for network extensions  new services  converters and network upgrades 
historically  we have been able to meet our cash requirements with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and issuances of private and public debt and equity 
cash provided by operations for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the timing of cash receipts and payments related to working capital accounts 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of significant acquisitions of cable television systems and reduced capital expenditures in cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million 
the change was primarily attributable to lower net borrowings from credit facilities in related to the absence of significant cable television system acquisitions 
for the years ended december  and  we spent million and million in capital expenditures largely to support our plant rebuild in illinois  which is expected to be substantially complete by mid  telephone deployment and success based capital including interactive digital and high speed data expansion 
for the year ending december   it is anticipated that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures 
we have concluded a number of financing transactions  which fully support our operating plan 
these transactions are detailed as follows on october   in connection with the formation of insight midwest and our acquisition of a interest in the kentucky systems  insight midwest completed an offering of million principal amount of its senior notes due the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay certain outstanding debt of the kentucky systems

interest on the insight midwest senior notes is payable on april and october of each year and interest on the insight midwest senior notes is payable on may and november of each year 
the indentures relating to these senior notes impose certain limitations on the ability of insight midwest to  among other things  incur debt  make distributions  make investments and sell assets

the midwest holdings credit facility permits the distribution of cash from midwest holdings subsidiaries to enable insight midwest to pay interest on its senior notes and senior notes  so long as there exists no default under the credit facility 
the midwest holdings credit facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the ability of midwest holdings and its subsidiaries to acquire or dispose of assets  make investments and engage in transactions with related parties 
the facility also requires compliance with certain financial ratios and contains customary events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the midwest holdings credit facility s covenant requirements 
given current operating conditions and projected results of operations  we anticipate continued compliance under this credit facility for the foreseeable future 
insight midwest acquired all of the common equity interests of insight ohio as part of the at t transactions

insight holdings of ohio llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of insight midwest  owns of the common equity of insight ohio and coaxial communications of central ohio  inc owns of the preferred equity of insight ohio 
such common and preferred equity was issued in august as part of a financing plan which resulted in i coaxial communications contributing the ohio system to insight ohio  ii coaxial communications and phoenix associates  an affiliate of coaxial communications  issuing million principal amount of senior notes due  iii coaxial llc and coaxial financing corp  an affiliate of coaxial llc  issuing million principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due and iv the coaxial senior notes and the coaxial senior discount notes being conditionally guaranteed by insight ohio

the ability of coaxial to make scheduled payments with respect to the senior notes and senior discount notes will depend on the financial and operating performance of insight ohio 
the distributions on the series a and b preferred 
table of contents interests equal the interest payments on the senior notes and senior discount notes 
on february   we completed an offering of million principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due these notes were issued at a discount to their principal amount at maturity resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
we utilized approximately million of the proceeds to repay the outstanding amount of our inter company loan from insight midwest  which we incurred in connection with the financing of the at t transactions 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including joint ventures and or strategic acquisitions 
no cash interest on the discount notes will accrue prior to february  thereafter  cash interest on the discount notes will accrue and be payable on february and august of each year  commencing august  the initial accreted value of the discount notes of approximately million will increase until february  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount on february  on april   we entered into an amendment to the insight midwest holdings credit facility which delayed by six months the scheduled reduction to the leverage ratio covenant to allow insight midwest holdings more financing flexibility  and increased the aggregate amount that can be distributed to insight midwest for the purpose of making investments in insight ohio 
previously  on march   we loaned million to insight midwest to lower our effective interest rates  million of which was contributed to insight midwest holdings on april  for use in paying down the credit facility balance and in funding financing costs associated with the amendments  and million of which was contributed to insight ohio on march  on june   a further amendment to the credit facility was entered into which permits distributions by insight midwest holdings to insight midwest for the purpose of repaying our million loan so long as there is no default under the midwest holdings credit facility

insight midwest received proceeds of million  including million of interest accruing from october  through the date of issuance that will be repaid to holders of the bonds in the first semi annual interest payment due on april   and net of an underwriting fee of million and reflects a bond discount of million that is being amortized through october the proceeds of this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding revolving loans under the midwest holdings credit facility 
since this add on offering occurred under the senior notes indenture  these additional debt securities and the previous senior notes are considered a single series of senior notes with identical terms 
on december  we repurchased million face amount of the senior discount notes at the then accreted value of million for million  resulting in a gain of million  net of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs of  as of december   the outstanding principal and accreted amounts of these notes were million and million

critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations carried out by us require management to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
we also utilize appraisal reports issued by independent appraisers 
should actual use of assets or resolution of obligations differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated fair values would be required 
if a change in estimate occurs after one year of the acquisition  the change would be recorded in our statement of operations 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  we ceased amortizing goodwill and franchise costs arising from acquisitions 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an annual impairment analysis 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record an impairment charge in our statement of operations 
investments periodically  we make strategic investments 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
all other equity investments are carried at cost 
each quarter  we assess the value of these investments by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies and other external sources 
based on the information acquired  we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fixed assets fixed assets include costs capitalized for labor and overhead incurred in connection with the installation of cable systems and is stated at cost 
depreciation for buildings  cable system equipment  furniture  fixtures and office equipment is calculated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
building improvements are amortized using the straight line method over shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated lives of the improvements 
risk factors we have substantial debt and have significant interest payment requirements  which may adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future to finance our operations and our ability to react to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
the following table shows certain important credit statistics about us 
as of december  dollars in thousands total debt  including preferred interests stockholders equity debt to equity ratio x 
table of contents our high level of combined debt could have important consequences for you  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital or other purposes may be limited  we will need to use a large portion of our revenues to pay interest on our borrowings  which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations  capital expenditures and other activities  some of our debt has a variable rate of interest  which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates  and our indebtedness may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
our primary asset is a stake in insight midwest  and our sole business is the management of insight midwest s cable television systems 
we may be forced to liquidate insight midwest before our senior discount notes mature 
although our financial statements consolidate the results of insight midwest  we own only of the outstanding partnership interests in insight midwest 
the other of insight midwest is owned by an indirect subsidiary of comcast corporation  an entity over which we have no control 
as a result  although our financial statements include of the revenues and operating cash flow of insight midwest  we are only entitled to share in the results and assets of insight midwest to the extent of our partnership interest 
insight midwest accounted for substantially all of our revenues and operating cash flow in fiscal our interest in insight midwest constitutes substantially all of our operating assets 
the only cash we receive directly from insight midwest is a management fee of based on revenues of the cable television systems and reimbursement of expenses 
the insight midwest partnership agreement provides that at any time after december  either comcast cable or insight lp our wholly owned subsidiary that owns our interest in insight midwest will have the right to cause a split up of insight midwest  subject to a limited right of postponement held by the non initiating partner 
the split up would reduce the cash flow from operations that we need to repay our debt  and could require us to make a change of control offer which we may be unable to finance 
we depend upon our operating subsidiaries for cash to fund our obligations 
our investments in our operating subsidiaries  including insight midwest  constitute substantially all of our operating assets 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
the principal source of the cash we need to pay our obligations is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and their borrowings 
the ability of our operating subsidiaries to generate cash is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate cash flow from operations in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness 

table of contents our ability to access the cash flow of our subsidiaries may be contingent upon our ability to refinance the debt of our subsidiaries  and we may be required to refinance certain indebtedness prior to maturity 
our subsidiaries ability to make payments to us will depend upon their operating results 
insight midwest s ability to receive cash from its subsidiaries is restricted by the terms of the midwest holdings credit facility 
the midwest holdings credit facility permits midwest holdings subsidiaries to distribute cash to insight midwest  but only so long as there is no default under such credit facility 
the terms of its indebtedness prohibit insight ohio from making distributions to insight midwest 
even if insight midwest receives funds from its subsidiaries  there can be no assurance that insight midwest can or would distribute cash to us to make payments on the notes due to restrictions imposed by the indentures governing insight midwest s outstanding senior notes and the insight midwest partnership agreement 
the indentures governing insight midwest s outstanding senior notes and senior notes limit insight midwest s ability to distribute cash to us for any purpose 
furthermore  because we only own a equity interest in insight midwest  the insight midwest partnership agreement provides that insight midwest may not pay dividends or make other distributions to us without the consent of our partner  comcast cable 
as a result  even if the creditors of insight midwest and its subsidiaries were to permit distributions to us  comcast cable could prohibit any such distribution 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the cash flow of insight midwest and its subsidiaries to make payments on our senior discount notes 
if we are unable to refinance the indebtedness of insight midwest and its subsidiaries on terms that provide insight midwest with a greater ability to provide us with funds prior to august   we may not be able to make payments required under the senior discount notes 
furthermore  borrowings under the midwest holdings credit facility are secured and a portion of such facility will mature prior to our and insight midwest s outstanding notes 
accordingly  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the midwest holdings credit facility requires us to comply with various financial and operating restrictions which could limit our ability to compete as well as our ability to expand 
the midwest holdings credit facility contains covenants that restrict midwest holdings subsidiaries ability to distribute funds or pay dividends to insight midwest  incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity  repurchase or redeem equity interests and indebtedness  pledge or sell assets or merge with another entity  create liens  and make certain capital expenditures  investments or acquisitions 

table of contents such restrictions could limit our ability to compete as well as our ability to expand 
the ability of midwest holdings subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
if they were to breach any of these covenants  they would be in default under the credit facility and they would be prohibited from making distributions to insight midwest 
we have a history of net losses  and may not be profitable in the future 
we have a history of net losses and expect to incur additional net losses in the future 
we incurred a net loss before accruals of preferred interests of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have and will continue to have a substantial amount of interest expense in respect of debt incurred and depreciation and amortization expenses relating to acquisitions of cable systems as well as expansion and upgrade programs 
such expenses have contributed to the net losses we experienced 
we expect that we will continue to incur such non operating expenses at increased levels as a result of our recent acquisitions and our network upgrade program  which expenses will result in continued net losses 
we have a limited history of operating our current cable television systems and these systems may not generate sales at or exceeding historical levels 
we are still in the process of integrating the illinois systems we acquired in january the historical financial information of our systems may not fully indicate our future operating results 
this makes it difficult for you to completely evaluate our performance 
we could face considerable business and financial risk in implementing our acquisition strategy 
as part of our strategy of pursuing value enhancing transactions  we intend to seek to swap or acquire systems that strategically fit our clustering and operating strategy 
although we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and joint ventures  we do not currently have any understandings  commitments or agreements relating to any acquisitions 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks we could face with respect to acquisitions include difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  and expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company 
the risks associated with acquisitions could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all 

table of contents our programming costs are substantial and they may increase  which could result in a decrease in profitability if we are unable to pass that increase on to our customers 
in recent years the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming  and sports programming in particular 
for through  programming costs increased significantly 
our cable programming services are dependent upon our ability to procure programming that is attractive to our customers at reasonable rates 
programming costs may continue to escalate and we may not be able to pass programming cost increases on to our customers 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected by further increases in programming costs 
programming has been and is expected to continue to be our largest single expense item and accounted for approximately of the total programming and other operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses for our systems for the year ended december  we are uncertain whether the recent acquisition by comcast of at t s broadband business will have an adverse effect on our future financial and operating results  and whether it will affect our telephone services contract or programming costs 
until recently  insight midwest was owned by us  as general partner  and by an indirect subsidiary of at t broadband  as limited partner 
at t broadband was a fully integrated business unit of at t corp 
as a result of comcast s acquisition of at t broadband on november   a new senior management team comprised principally of individuals that prior to the transaction operated the comcast cable properties will exercise significant control over decisions relating to insight midwest s limited partner 
insight midwest s partnership agreement prohibits it from taking certain actions without the approval of the limited partner 
accordingly  insight midwest will be dependent upon the discretion of its limited partner s new management in obtaining approval for certain significant transactions 
our long term agreements with comcast cable to facilitate the delivery of local telephone services uses comcast cable s switching and transport facilities and our network infrastructure  on which comcast cable leases capacity for a fee 
comcast cable is the regulated telephone carrier for the provision of the telephone services 
we are unable to predict whether the new management for comcast cable will affect our contractual relationship for the provision of telephone services 
furthermore  there can be no assurance how comcast cable will continue to carry out its obligations under our telephone agreements  whether with respect to existing or future deployments 
all of our existing deployments of telephone services are marketed under the at t digital phone brand 
we are uncertain whether comcast has made any arrangements with at t for the continued licensing to us of the at t digital phone brand  as required by the terms of the agreements 
it has been the belief of our management that our telephone services would be able to achieve higher penetration levels by marketing the service under the at t brand and leveraging at t s telephone expertise with our local presence and customer relationships 
we are unable to predict whether the inability to market telephone services using the at t brand would have an adverse effect on the future results of our telephone operations 
we have relied in the past on our contractual arrangements with at t broadband s programming supplier  satellite services  inc  for the purchase of certain programming services for our systems at what we believe are attractive rates 
as a result of comcast s acquisition of at t broadband  comcast and at t broadband in many cases have long term agreements  in some cases with the same counter parties  for the same services and products  such as programming 
in the cases where there are separate agreements with the same counterparties  comcast is presently evaluating whether such 
table of contents agreements apply only to the operations to which they have historically applied or whether instead one of the two contracts will apply to the operations of both companies and the other contract will be terminated 
we are unable to determine whether such matters will have an adverse effect on our programming costs 
the competition we face from other cable networks and alternative service providers may cause us to lose market share 
the impact from competition  particularly from direct broadcast satellite television systems and companies that overbuild in our market areas  has resulted in a decrease in customer growth rates as well as a loss of subscribers 
the industry growth rate for basic customers for the years ended december and was 
and respectively  while satellite penetration as of december averaged nationwide  slightly down from in december this in turn has negatively impacted our financial performance 
increased competition may continue to impact our financial performance 
many of our potential competitors have substantially greater resources than we do  and we cannot predict the market share our competitors will eventually achieve  nor can we predict their ability to develop products which will compete with our planned new and enhanced products and services such as high speed data access  video on demand and telephone services 
direct broadcast satellite service consists of television programming transmitted via high powered satellites to individual homes  each served by a small satellite dish 
legislation permitting direct broadcast satellite operators to transmit local broadcast signals was enacted on november  this eliminates a significant competitive advantage that cable system operators have had over direct broadcast satellite operators 
direct broadcast satellite operators have begun delivering local broadcast signals in the largest markets and there are plans to expand such carriage to many more markets over the next year 
since our cable systems are operated under non exclusive franchises  competing operators of cable systems and other potential competitors  such as municipalities and municipal utility providers  may be granted franchises to build cable systems in markets where we hold franchises 
competition in geographic areas where a secondary franchise is obtained and a cable network is constructed is called overbuilding 
as of december   approximately of the homes passed by our cable systems were overbuilt 
also as of december   an affiliate of southern indiana gas and electric co 
has overbuilt our evansville  indiana system and passes approximately  homes also passed by us 
in addition  knology  inc has obtained a franchise to provide cable television service in the city of louisville  kentucky  where we operate a system  although they have not constructed a cable system 
in addition  as of december   wideopenwest had overbuilt our columbus  ohio system and passed approximately  homes also passed by us 
in our illinois system  the city of springfield is considering a municipal overbuild 
we cannot predict what effect competition from these or future competitors will have on our business and operations 
we will face competition from providers of alternatives to our internet and telephone services 
several telephone companies are introducing digital subscriber line technology also known as dsl  which allows internet access over traditional phone lines at data transmission speeds greater than those available by a standard telephone modem 
although these transmission speeds are not as great as the transmission speeds of a cable modem  we believe that the transmission speeds of digital subscriber line technology are sufficiently high that such technology will compete with cable modem technology 
we cannot predict the impact dsl technology will have on our internet access services or on our operations 
as we expand our offerings to include telephone services  the telephone services we deliver will be subject to competition from existing providers  including both local exchange telephone companies 
table of contents and long distance carriers 
we cannot predict the extent to which the presence of these competitors will influence customer penetration in our telephone service areas 
we expect that the most significant competitors for our internet access and telephone service offerings will be the existing local exchange telephone companies as well as resellers using the local exchange telephone companies communications networks 
these competitors are currently the predominant providers of internet and telephone services in our markets 
we may be required to provide access to our networks to other internet service providers  which could significantly increase our competition and adversely affect our ability to provide new products and services 
the us congress and the federal communications commission have been asked to require cable operators to provide access over their cable systems to other internet service providers 
if we are required to provide open access  it could prohibit us from entering into or limit our existing agreements with internet service providers  adversely impact our anticipated revenues from high speed internet access services and complicate marketing and technical issues associated with the introduction of these services 
to date  the us congress and the federal communications commission have declined to impose these requirements although the fcc has recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on this matter 
this same open access issue is also being considered by some local franchising authorities and several courts 
franchise renewals and transfers could become more difficult depending upon the outcome of this issue 
our business has been and continues to be subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation  and changes in this legislation and regulation could increase our costs of compliance and reduce the profitability of our business 
the cable television industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation at the federal and local levels  and  in some instances  at the state level  and many aspects of such regulation are currently the subject of judicial proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals 
operating in a regulated industry increases the cost of doing business generally 
we may also become subject to additional regulatory burdens and related increased costs 
as we continue to introduce additional communications services  we may be required to obtain federal  state and local licenses or other authorizations to offer such services 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses or authorizations in a timely manner  or at all  or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses and authorizations that may not be favorable to us 
members of management  as major stockholders  possess unequal voting rights resulting in the ability to control all major corporate decisions  and other stockholders may be unable to influence these corporate decisions 
we have two classes of common stock class a which carries one vote per share and class b which carries ten votes per share 
our directors  executive officers  members of management and family members own all of the outstanding class b common stock 
as a result of their stock ownership  such holders of class b common stock will have the power to elect all of our directors and control stockholder decisions on other matters such as amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and mergers or other fundamental corporate transactions 
the interests of our controlling stockholders  including our management  may conflict with the interests of the other holders of class a common stock 
the disproportionate voting rights of the class a common stock relative to the class b common stock may make us a less attractive target for a takeover than we otherwise might be or render more difficult or discourage a merger proposal or a tender offer 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our revolving credit and term loan agreements bear interest at floating rates 
accordingly  we are exposed to potential losses related to changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  we enter into derivative financial instruments  typically interest rate swaps and collars 
the counter parties to our swap and collar agreements are major financial institutions 
as of december   million of our interest rate swap and collar agreements expire in varying amounts through july and million expire in august the fair market value and carrying value of our senior notes  senior notes and senior discount notes was billion as of december  additionally  the fair market value of our credit facility borrowings approximate their carrying values as the credit facility borrowings bear interest at floating rates of interest 
as of december   the estimated fair value cost if terminated of our interest rate swap and collar agreements was approximately million  which represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices and is reflected in our financial statements as other non current liabilities 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive loss depending on whether the derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swaps that approximated million  or  of our borrowings under all of our credit facilities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million
