item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview the company began operations in september and initially focused on the acquisition of producing properties 
as a result of the increasing availability of economic onshore d seismic surveys  the company began to obtain d seismic data and options to lease substantial acreage in and began to drill its d based prospects in the company drilled  and gross wells in the gulf coast region in  and respectively 
the company has budgeted to drill gross wells net in in the gulf coast region  however  the actual number of wells drilled will vary depending upon various factors  including the availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and industry partner issues  company cash flow  success of drilling programs  weather delays and other factors 
if the company drills the number of wells it has budgeted for  depreciation  depletion and amortization are expected to increase and oil and gas operating expenses are expected to increase over levels incurred in the company has typically retained the majority of its interests in shallow  normally pressured prospects and sold a portion of its interests in deeper  over pressured prospects 
the company has primarily grown through the internal development of properties within its exploration project areas  although the company acquired properties with existing production in the camp hill project in late  the encinitas project in early and the la rosa project in the company made these acquisitions through the use of limited partnerships with carrizo or carrizo production  inc as the general partner 
in addition  in november the company acquired assets in wharton county  texas in the jones branch project area for approximately million 
during the second quarter of  the company formed ccbm  inc ccbm as a wholly owned subsidiary 
ccbm was formed to acquire interests in certain oil and gas leases in wyoming and montana in areas prospective for coalbed methane and develop such interests 
the company also acquired a  gross acre coalbed methane property in wyoming  the bobcat project  for million in cash and common stock in july ccbm plans to spend up to million for drilling costs on these leases through december  of which would be spent pursuant to an obligation to fund million of drilling costs on behalf of rmg  from whom the interests in the leases were acquired 
through december   ccbm has satisfied million of its drilling obligations on behalf of rmg 
ccbm has drilled or acquired gross wells net and incurred total drilling costs of million through december  these wells typically take up to months to evaluate and determine whether or not they are successful 
ccbm has budgeted to drill up to gross net wells in the coalbed methane wells include wells acquired as a result of the bobcat acquisition 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including any general and administrative costs that are directly attributable to the company s acquisition  exploration and development activities  are capitalized in a full cost pool as incurred 
the company records depletion of its full cost pool using the unit of production method 
to the extent that such capitalized costs in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  such excess costs are charged to operations 
based on oil and gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december  removed the necessity to record a write down 
using prices in effect on december  the write down would have been approximately million 
because of the volatility of oil and gas prices  no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a write down in future periods 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for increased to million from million in production volumes for natural gas in increased to  mmcf from  mmcf in realized average natural gas prices decreased to per mcf in from per mcf in production volumes for oil in increased to mbbls from mbbls in the increase in oil production was due primarily to the commencement of production at the delta farms  riverdale  staubach and burkhart r wells offset by the natural decline in production of other older wells 
the increase in natural gas production was due primarily to the commencement of production at the delta farms  riverdale  staubach  burkhart r and pauline huebner a wells offset by the natural decline in production at other wells  primarily from the initial matagorda county project wells 
oil and natural gas revenues include the impact of hedging activities as discussed below under volatility of oil and gas prices

oil and natural gas operating expenses for increased to million from million in oil and natural gas operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the addition of new oil and gas wells drilled and completed since december  and higher ad valorem taxes 
operating expenses per equivalent unit in decreased to per mcfe from per mcfe in the per unit cost decreased primarily as a result of the addition of higher production rate  lower cost per unit wells offset by an increase in ad valorem taxes and decreased production of natural gas as wells naturally decline 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily due to increased production and the additional seismic and drilling costs added to the proved property cost base 
general and administrative g a expense for increased to million from million for the increase in g a was due primarily to the addition of contract staff to handle increased drilling and production activities and higher insurance costs 
interest income for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of lower interest rates during capitalized interest decreased to million in from million in primarily due to lower interest costs during income taxes decreased to million in from million in dividends and accretion of discount on preferred stock increased to million in from none in as a result of the sale of preferred stock in the first quarter of net income for decreased to million from million in primarily as a result of the factors described above 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues for decreased to million from million in production volumes for natural gas in decreased to  mmcf from  mmcf in realized average natural gas prices increased to per mcf in from per mcf in production volumes for oil in decreased to mbbls from mbbls in the decrease in oil production was due to the natural decline in production primarily at the jones branch wells and the initial matagorda project wells offset by the commencement of production of the pitchfork ranch well 
the decrease in natural gas production was due primarily to the sale of the metro project during and the natural decline in production primarily at the initial matagorda project wells offset by the commencement of production at the additional cedar point project wells  the west bay project well and the pitchfork ranch well 
oil and natural gas revenues include the cash effect of hedging activities as discussed below under volatility of oil and natural gas prices 
average oil prices decreased to per bbl in from per bbl in the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenues for the company s oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december  and period december  compared to period increase increase decrease decrease production volumes oil and condensate mbbls natural gas mmcf    average sales prices oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf operating revenues in thousands oil and condensate    natural gas    total   including the impact of hedging 
oil and natural gas operating expenses for decreased to million from million in oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of the lower production taxes and the implementation of cost reduction measures in fields with decreased production 
operating expenses per equivalent unit in increased to per mcfe from per mcfe in the per unit cost increased primarily as a result of an increase in severance taxes and decreased production of natural gas as wells naturally decline 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense for decreased to million from million in this decrease was primarily due to the seismic and drilling costs added to the proved property cost base 
general and administrative g a expense for increased to million from million for the increase in g a was due primarily to the addition of staff to handle increased drilling and production activities 
stock option compensation expense is a non cash charge resulting from a decrease during and an increase during the last six months of in the stock price underlying the stock options that were repriced in february interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  for decreased to  from  in income taxes increased to million in from million in the increase was the result of an adjusted valuation allowance during on net operating loss carryforwards expected to be realized that resulted in a deferred income tax benefit adjustment of million which reduced the company s effective tax rate to in other income for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of an investment in michael petroleum corporation mpc of million offset by a charge and related legal expenses of million in respect of the final settlement of litigation with bnp petroleum corporation and a non cash valuation allowance of million relating to certain hedge arrangements with enron north america corp 
net income for decreased to million from million in as a result of the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources the company has made and is expected to make oil and gas capital expenditures in excess of its net cash flows provided by operating activities in order to complete the exploration and development of its existing properties 
the company will require additional sources of financing to fund drilling expenditures on properties currently owned by the company and to fund leasehold costs and geological and geophysical cost on its exploration projects 
while the company believes that current cash balances and anticipated cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient capital to carry out the company s exploration plans  management of the company continues to seek financing for its capital program from a variety of sources 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms that would be acceptable to the company 
the company s inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
without raising additional capital  the company anticipates that it may be required to limit or defer its planned oil and natural gas exploration and development program  which could adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
the company s primary sources of liquidity have included proceeds from the initial public offering  the december sale of subordinated notes  common stock and warrants  the sale of shares of series a preferred stock and warrants  the february sale of series b preferred stock and warrants  funds generated by operations  equity capital contributions  borrowings primarily under revolving credit facilities and funding under the palace agreement that provided a portion of the funding for the company s  and drilling program in return for participation in certain wells 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in as compared to was due primarily to the increase in trade accounts payable and the one time gain on the sale of an investment in mpc 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in as compared to was due primarily to the one time gains on the sale of an investment in mpc in the company budgeted capital expenditures in of approximately million of which million of which is expected to be used for drilling activities in the company s project areas and the balance is expected to be used to fund d seismic surveys  land acquisitions and capitalized interest and overhead costs 
the company has budgeted to drill approximately gross wells net in the gulf coast region and gross net ccbm coalbed methane wells in the actual number of wells drilled and capital expended is dependent upon available financing  cash flow  availability and cost of drilling rigs  land and partner issues and other factors 
the company has continued to reinvest a substantial portion of its cash flows into increasing its d prospect portfolio  improving its d seismic interpretation technology and funding its drilling program 
oil and gas capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s drilling efforts resulted in the successful completion of gross wells net in and gross wells net in and gross wells net in in the gulf coast region 
of the gross wells net drilled or acquired by ccbm  gross wells net are currently producing and gross wells net are awaiting evaluation before a determination can be made as to their success 
during november  the company entered into a one year contract with grey wolf  inc for utilization of a  horsepower drilling rig capable of drilling wells to a depth of approximately  feet 
the contract  which commenced in march  provides for a dayrate of  per day 
the rig was utilized primarily to drill wells in the company s focus areas  including the matagorda project area and the cabeza creek project area 
the contract contained a provision which would allow the company to terminate the contract early by tendering payment equal to one half the dayrate for the number of days remaining under the term of the contract as of the date of termination 
the contract expired in february steven a 
webster  who is the chairman of the board of directors of the company  is a member of the board of directors of grey wolf  inc ccbm plans to spend up to million for drilling costs through december  of which would be spent pursuant to an obligation to fund million of drilling costs on behalf of rmg 
through december   ccbm has satisfied million of its drilling obligations on behalf of rmg

ability to manage growth and achieve business strategy the company s growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
the company has relied in the past and expects to continue to rely on project partners and independent contractors that have provided the company with seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services 
at december   the company had full time employees 
there will be additional demands on the company s financial  technical  operational and administrative resources and continued reliance by the company on project partners and independent contractors  and these strains on resources  additional demands and continued reliance may negatively affect the company 
the company s ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including its ability to obtain leases or options on properties for d seismic surveys  its ability to acquire additional d seismic data  its ability to identify and acquire new exploratory sites  its ability to develop existing sites  its ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  its ability to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors  the results of its drilling program  hydrocarbon prices  access to capital and other factors 
although the company intends to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources and to increase its ability to provide internally certain of the services previously provided by outside sources  there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so or that it will be able to continue to maintain or enter into new relationships with project partners and independent contractors 
the failure of the company to continue to upgrade its technical  operational and administrative resources or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties  including difficulties in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified personnel to enable the company to expand its seismic data acquisition and drilling program  or the reduced availability of project partners and independent contractors that have historically provided the company seismic survey planning and management  project and prospect generation  land acquisition  drilling and other services  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any increase in the company s activities as an operator will increase its exposure to operating hazards 
see business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
the company s lack of capital will also constrain its ability to grow and achieve its business strategy 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in achieving growth or any other aspect of its business strategy 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the asset is placed in service  a liability is recorded and a corresponding asset is recorded 
accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
on january   the company recorded million as proved properties and million as a liability for its plugging and abandonment expenses 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and the company will adopt the statement effective january  the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  issued in december  effective with its december  consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
oil and natural gas properties investments in oil and natural gas properties are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
all costs directly associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
such costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  and drilling and completion equipment 
the company proportionally consolidates its interests in oil and natural gas properties 
the company capitalized compensation costs for employees working directly on exploration activities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
oil and natural gas properties are amortized based on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until they are impaired 
unevaluated properties are evaluated periodically for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and  where significant  dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
the depletion rate per thousand cubic feet equivalent mcfe for  and was  and respectively 
dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test  which limits such costs to the estimated present value  discounted at a interest rate  of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is charged to operations through depreciation  depletion and amortization 
no write down of the company s oil and natural gas assets was necessary in  or based on oil and natural gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december  removed the necessity to record a write down 
using prices in effect on december  the pretax writedown would have been approximately million 
because of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  no assurance can be given that the company will not experience a write down in future periods 
depreciation of other property and equipment is provided using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from five to years 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are estimates prepared by ryder scott company and fairchild wells  inc  independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of hydrocarbons that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretation of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions regarding drilling and operating expense  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the sec mandates some of these assumptions such as oil and natural gas prices and the present value discount rate 
proved reserve estimates prepared by others may be substantially higher or lower than the company s estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may differ from actual results  reserve quantities actually recovered may be significantly different than estimated 
material revisions to reserve estimates may be made depending on the results of drilling  testing  and rates of production 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
the company s rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for proved properties is dependent on the company s estimate of proved reserves 
if these reserve estimates decline  the rate at which the company records these expenses will increase 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 establishes standards of accounting for and disclosures of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement requires all derivative instruments to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in a derivative instrument s fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
sfas no 
was effective for the company beginning january  and was adopted by the company on that date 
in accordance with the current transition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recorded a cumulative effect transition adjustment of million net of related tax expense of million in accumulated other comprehensive income to recognize the fair value of its derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments at the date of adoption 
upon entering into a derivative contract  the company designates the derivative instruments as a hedge of the variability of cash flow to be received cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent that the derivative is effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
any ineffectiveness in the relationship between the cash flow hedge and the hedged item is recognized currently in income 
gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income associated with the cash flow hedge are recognized in earnings as oil and natural gas revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
all of the company s derivative instruments at january   december  and december  were designated and effective as cash flow hedges except for its positions with an affiliate of enron corp 
discussed in note when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized in earnings immediately 
in all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued  the derivative will be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with future changes in its fair value recognized in future earnings 
the company typically uses fixed rate swaps and costless collars to hedge its exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and oil

 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes are recognized at each yearend for the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized 
contingencies liabilities and other contingencies are recognized upon determination of an exposure  which when analyzed indicates that it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and that the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices the company s revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of its properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of the company 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in the middle east  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with certainty 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company can produce economically 
oil and natural gas prices have declined in the recent past and there can be no assurance that prices will recover or will not decline further 
see business and properties marketing 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the commission 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of this ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the end of each fiscal quarter and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded  even if prices were depressed for only a short period of time 
the company may be required to write down the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
based on oil and gas prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our oil and gas properties exceeded the cost center ceiling 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  improvements in pricing subsequent to december   removed the necessity to record a write down 
using prices in effect on december  the write down would have been approximately million 
the company typically uses fixed rate swaps and costless collars to hedge its exposure to material changes in the price of natural gas and oil

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk 
the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility have been discussed above  and such volatility is expected to continue 
a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s annual revenues and operating income 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company engages periodically in certain limited hedging activities but only to the extent of buying protection price floors 
costs and any benefits derived from these price floors are accordingly recorded as a reduction or increase  as applicable  in oil and gas sales revenue and were not significant for any year presented 
the costs to purchase put options are amortized over the option period 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
income and losses realized by the company related to these instruments were million  million and million or   and per mmbtu for the years ended december    and  respectively 
interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its floating rate debt 
in regards to its revolving credit facility  the result of a fluctuation in short term interest rates would have impacted cash flow by approximately  financial instruments debt maturities 
the company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowing  subordinated notes payable and series b redeemable preferred stock 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank and vendor borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon interest rates currently available to the company for borrowings with similar terms 
maturities of the debt are million in  million in  million in and the balance in
