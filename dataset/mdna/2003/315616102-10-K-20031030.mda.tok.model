net product revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of sales in asia pacific and europe

table of contents the future and expect the percentage of big ip revenues derived from ip application switches to continue to increase as a percentage of total product revenues 
net service revenues were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year service revenues increased by in fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers  as our installed base increased 
the decrease in service revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to changes in pricing and a larger percentage of our resellers providing maintenance and installation to end users  partially offset by an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers 
ingram micro inc  one of our domestic distributors  accounted for of our total net revenues for fiscal year ingram micro accounted for of our accounts receivable as of september  no individual customer or distributor represented more than of our total net revenues or accounts receivable for fiscal years and years ended september  in thousands  except for percentages gross margin cost of net revenues products services total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of related net revenue cost of net revenues products services total gross margin cost of net product revenues 
cost of net product revenues decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year cost of net product revenues decreased as a percent of net product revenue to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of lower warranty  manufacturing and component costs

further  in fiscal year  we unified our supply chain with a single contract manufacturer and  as result  have improved our manufacturing efficiencies  as well as realized lower component costs 
cost of net service revenues 
cost of net service revenues decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year cost of net service revenues decreased as a percent of net service revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in personnel related costs associated with a decline in service personnel headcount and related costs during the last quarter of fiscal year this decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies and a decrease in headcount and related costs

research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the salaries and related benefits for our product development personnel and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was due to increased personnel related costs associated with an increase in headcount to from primarily as a result of the acquisition of substantially all the assets of uroam and an increase in prototype expenses 
the increase in fiscal year was due to increased personnel related costs and expenses related to the development of new products 
we expect to continue to increase research and development expenses as our future success is dependent on the continued enhancement of our current products and our ability to develop new products that meet the changing needs of our customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the salaries  benefits and related costs of our executive  finance  information technology  human resource and legal personnel  third party professional service fees  bad debt charges and an allocation of our facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in professional services related to patent prosecution and other activities related to our intellectual property and lower bad debt charges

during the quarter ended march   we reversed  of previous estimates 
as of september   substantially all of the restructuring charges accrued during the first quarter of had been paid 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of continuing restructuring liabilities 
amortization of unearned compensation 
we have recorded a total of million of stock compensation costs since our inception through september  these charges represent the difference  on the grant date  between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of certain stock options granted to our employees and outside directors 
these options generally vest ratably over a four year period 
we are amortizing these costs using an accelerated method as prescribed by financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations with our cash balances  cash generated from operations and proceeds from public offerings 
years ended september  in thousands liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at the end of fiscal year  compared to million at the end of fiscal year and million at the end of fiscal year cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year was million compared to million in fiscal year and cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and resulted primarily from cash generated from net income  after adjusting for non cash charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in the renewal of service and support contracts by existing customers 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal year resulted primarily from operating losses  partially offset by a decrease in net accounts receivable

cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year and million for the fiscal year in fiscal years and  our financing activities primarily related to cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal year  we also received million related to the issuance of common stock and warrants to nokia finance international bv the warrants expired in january without being exercised 
we expect that our existing cash balances and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases 
in april  we amended and restated the lease agreement relating to two buildings for our corporate headquarters 
the lease commenced in july on the first building  and the lease on the second building commenced in september the lease for both buildings expires in with an option for renewal 
the lease for the second building has been fully subleased through we established a restricted escrow account in connection with this lease agreement 
under the term of the lease  a million certificate of deposit is required through november  unless the lease is terminated before then 
this amount has 
table of contents been included on our balance sheet as a component of restricted cash 
contractual obligations reflected in the following table are net of sublease income 
payments due by period less than after obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance provided under statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulleting sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we sell products through resellers  oems  and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users  under similar terms 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
product revenues from oem agreements are recognized based on reporting of sales from the oem partner 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support  or pcs  elements are combined into a package with a single bundled price  a portion of the sales price is allocated to each element of the bundled elements based on their respective fair values as determined when the individual elements are sold separately 
revenues from the license of software are recognized when the software has been shipped and the customer is obligated to pay for the software 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  we recognize revenue when such rights of return lapse 
revenues for pcs are recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term 
pcs includes rights to upgrades  when and if available  a limited period of telephone support  updates  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses  and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
training revenue is recognized when the training has been completed 
our ordinary payment terms to our domestic customers are net days 
our ordinary payment terms to our international customers are net to days based on normal and customary trade practices in the individual markets 
we have offered extended payment terms beyond ordinary terms to some customers 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized when payments become due 
reserve for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we evaluate historical write offs  current trends in the credit quality of our customer base  as well as changes in the credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require any collateral 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may not be insufficient 

table of contents reserve for product returns 
product returns are estimated based on historical experience by type of product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized 
in some instances  product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing rights of return 
accordingly  we reduce recognized revenue for estimated future returns at the time revenue is recorded 
when rights of return are present and we cannot estimate returns  revenue is recognized when such rights lapse 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns  inventory in the distribution channel  and other related factors 
it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that the actual amounts could vary from our estimates and result in reductions to recognized revenues 
reserve for excess or obsolete inventory 
we currently reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory charges may be required 
reserve for warranties 
a warranty reserve is established based on our historical experience and an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
income tax valuation allowance 
the company has net deferred tax assets at september  totaling approximately million  which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to management s determination that the criteria for recognition have not been met 
in the event management were to determine that the company would be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be made  increasing net income or decreasing net loss in the period in which such a determination was made 
as of september   approximately million of the valuation allowance related to the company s net operating loss carry forwards is derived from the tax benefits of stock option deductions 
at such time as the valuation allowance related to their deductions is released  the benefits will be credited to additional paid in capital 
purchase price allocation 
during  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of uroam  inc for cash of million 
the company also incurred million of direct transaction costs for a total purchase price of million 
the total purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value was recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon estimates and assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management

have been included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our company and its business 
our success depends on sales and continued innovation of our big ip product line for the fiscal year ended september   we derived of our product revenues from sales of our big ip product line 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our net revenues from sales of our big ip products in the future 
implementation of our strategy depends upon big ip being able to solve critical network availability and performance problems of our customers 
if big ip is unable to solve these problems for our customers  or if we are unable to sustain the high levels of innovation in big ip s product feature set needed to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
our success depends on our timely development of new products and features and proper management of the timing of the life cycle of our products we expect the secure application traffic management market to be characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our continued success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and new features for our existing products to meet the demands of these changes  and for those products and features to be accepted by our existing and target customers 
if we are unable to identify  develop and deploy new products and new product features on a timely basis  or if those products do not gain market acceptance  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products  or replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
we have also experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
also  in the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our products  which in turn has led to delays in 
table of contents product introductions 
in addition  complexity and difficulties in managing product transitions at the end of life stage of a product can create excess inventory of components associated with the outgoing product that can lead to increased expenses 
any or all of the above problems could materially harm our business and operating results 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the emerging secure application traffic management market the markets we serve are new  rapidly evolving and highly competitive  and we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
our principal competitors in the secure application traffic management market include cisco systems  inc  nortel networks corporation  foundry networks  inc  netscaler  inc  radware ltd 
and netscreen technologies  inc 
we expect to continue to face additional competition as new participants enter the traffic management market 
in addition  larger companies with significant resources  brand recognition and sales channels may form alliances with or acquire competing traffic management solutions and emerge as significant competitors 
potential competitors may bundle their products or incorporate an internet traffic management component into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products 
potential customers may also choose to purchase additional or larger servers instead of our products 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and may cause our stock price to fluctuate our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and will vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results 
in particular  we anticipate that the size of customer orders may increase as we continue to focus on larger business accounts 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from just one account  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
in the past  a majority of our sales have been realized near the end of a quarter 
accordingly  a delay in an anticipated sale past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact our results of operations for that quarter  or in some cases  that year 
furthermore  we base our decisions regarding our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and our expense levels are relatively fixed 
consequently  if revenue levels fall below our expectations  our net income will decrease because only a small portion of our operating expenses vary with our revenues 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future quarters or years 
our failure to meet these expectations will likely harm the market price of our common stock 
the average selling price of our products may decrease and our costs may increase  which may negatively impact gross profits we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
therefore  in order to maintain our gross profits  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so will cause our net revenue and gross profits to decline  which will harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
it is difficult to predict our future operating results because we have an unpredictable sales cycle our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which is difficult to predict 
historically  our sales cycle has ranged from approximately two to three months and has tended to lengthen as we have increasingly focused our sales efforts on the enterprise market 
also  as our distribution strategy has evolved into more of a channel model  utilizing value added resellers  distributors and systems integrators  the level of variability in the length of sales cycle across transactions has increased and made it more difficult to predict the timing of many of our sales transactions 
sales of our big ip and dns products require us to educate potential customers in their use and benefits 
sales of our products are subject to delays from the lengthy internal budgeting  approval and 
table of contents competitive evaluation processes that large corporations and governmental entities may require 
for example  customers frequently begin by evaluating our products on a limited basis and devote time and resources to testing our products before they decide whether or not to purchase 
customers may also defer orders as a result of anticipated releases of new products or enhancements by our competitors or us 
as a result  our products have an unpredictable sales cycle that contributes to the uncertainty of our future operating results 
our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturer is not able to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or if this single source of hardware assembly is lost or impaired we rely on a third party contract manufacturer to assemble our products 
we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware platforms to this contract manufacturer who assembles these hardware platforms to our specifications 
we have experienced minor delays in shipments from contract manufacturers in the past 
however  if we experience major delays in the future or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any one or a combination of these factors may harm our business and results of operations 
the inability of our contract manufacturer to provide us with adequate supplies of our products or the loss of our contract manufacturer may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and may harm our business and results of operations 
in particular  because we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to a single contract manufacturer  with whom we do not have a long term contract  any termination  loss or impairment in our arrangement with this single source of hardware assembly  or any impairment of their facilities or operations  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our raw material and component purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow may limit our revenue  may harm our competitive position and may result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers 
our business could suffer if there are any interruptions or delays in the supply of hardware components from our third party sources we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources 
lead times for these components vary significantly 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these hardware components  or the inability to procure a similar component from alternate sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time  may delay assembly and sales of our products and  hence  our revenues  and may harm our business and results of operations 
we may not adequately protect our intellectual property and our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure of confidential and proprietary information to protect our intellectual property rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims  we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
in addition  we have initiated  and may in the future initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for 
table of contents infringement of our proprietary rights  including infringement of a patent we hold on our cookie persistence technology  to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or those of our competitors 
any of these claims  whether claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others  or vice versa  with or without merit  may be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to cease using infringing technology  develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
further  our license agreements typically require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for infringement actions related to our technology  which could cause us to become involved in infringement claims made against our customers or resellers 
any of the above described circumstances relating to intellectual property rights disputes could result in our business and results of operations being harmed 
future changes in financial accounting standards or our revenue recognition policies may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
in particular  if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
similarly  while we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards  current revenue recognition accounting standards  and accounting guidance with respect to such standards  are subject to change 
such changes could lead to unanticipated changes in our current revenue accounting practices  and such changes could significantly reduce our future revenues and earnings  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not be able to sustain or develop new distribution relationships and a reduction or delay in sales to a significant distribution partner could hurt our business our sales strategy requires that we establish and maintain multiple distribution channels in the united states and internationally through leading industry resellers  original equipment manufacturers  or oems  systems integrators  internet service providers and other channel partners 
we have a limited number of agreements with companies in these channels  and we may not be able to increase our number of distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships 
if we are unable to establish and maintain our indirect sales channels  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
in addition  one distributor of our products accounted for of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended september  during the fiscal year ended september   no single reseller or customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to this or any other key distribution partner could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
undetected software errors may harm our business and results of operations software products frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have experienced these errors in the past in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we expect that these errors will be found from time to time in new or enhanced products after commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant 
table of contents customer relations problems 
we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to product errors 
while we carry insurance policies covering this type of liability  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim may harm our business and results of operations 
our products must successfully operate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of software errors  whether caused by our products or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products 
the occurrence of any of these problems may harm our business and results of operations 
our expansion into international markets may not succeed we intend to continue expanding into international markets 
international sales represented of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september   of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  and of our net revenues for the fiscal year ended september  we have engaged sales personnel throughout europe and the asia pacific region 
our continued growth will require further expansion of our international operations in the european  asia pacific and other markets 
if we are unable to expand our international operations successfully and in a timely manner  our business and results of operations may be harmed 
such expansion may be more difficult or take longer than we anticipate  and we may not be able to successfully market  sell  deliver and support our products internationally 
our operating results are exposed to risks associated with international commerce as our international sales increase  our operating results become more exposed to international operating risks 
these risks include risks related to potential recessions in economies outside the united states  foreign currency exchange rates  managing foreign sales offices  regulatory  political  or economic conditions in specific countries  military conflict or terrorist activities  changes in laws and tariffs  inadequate protection of intellectual property rights in foreign countries  foreign regulatory requirements  and natural disasters 
all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in particular  in fiscal year  we derived of our total revenue from the japanese market and this revenue is dependent on a number of factors outside our control  including the viability and success of our resellers and the strength of the japanese economy  which has been weak in recent years 
acquisitions  including our recent acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam  inc  present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that are contemplated at the time of the transaction with respect to our july acquisition of substantially all of the assets of uroam  inc  as well as any other future acquisitions we may undertake  we may find that the acquired assets do not further our business strategy as expected  or that we paid more than what the assets are later worth  or that economic conditions change  all of which may generate future impairment charges 
there may be difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and we may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business 
in the case of the assets acquired from uroam  inc  because it was based in northern california and because the employees we hired in connection with the acquisition were not relocated to seattle  the above mentioned integration and personnel retention issues represent a particular risk to us 
we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines 
our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations 
we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations 
we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with the product quality  technology and other matters 
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner  or to retain key personnel of uroam  inc or any other acquired business  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for integrated traffic 
table of contents management and security solutions and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our success depends on our key personnel and our ability to attract  train and retain qualified marketing and sales  professional services and customer support personnel our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and finance personnel  many of which may be difficult to replace 
the complexity of our secure application traffic management products and their integration into existing networks and ongoing support  as well as the sophistication of our sales and marketing effort  requires us to retain highly trained professional services  customer support and sales personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for qualified professional services  customer support and sales personnel in our industry is intense because of the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products 
our ability to retain and hire these personnel may be adversely affected by volatility or reductions in the price of our common stock  since these employees are generally granted stock options 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  may harm our business and results of operations 
we face litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company without further action by our stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
further  certain provisions of our bylaws  including a provision limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of our company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered board  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
similarly  state anti takeover laws in the state of washington related to corporate takeovers may prevent or delay a change of control of our company

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio with the exception of treasury securities  commercial paper and money market funds  which are exempt from size limitation 
the policy requires investments in securities that mature in two years or less  with the average maturity being one year or less 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
a decrease of one percent in the average interest would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in our interest income

the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended september  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  as we continue to expand our operations internationally  they may become significant in the future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
