item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background formation of interstate hotels resorts meristar hotels resorts  or meristar  and interstate hotels corporation  or interstate  entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated may   as amended on june  in the merger transaction  interstate merged with and into meristar  and meristar was renamed interstate hotels resorts  inc on july   after receiving the required stockholder approvals  meristar and interstate completed the merger 
the transaction was a stock for stock merger of interstate into meristar in which interstate s stockholders received shares of common stock for each share of interstate stock outstanding 
holders of meristar s common stock and operating partnership units continued to hold their stock and units following the merger 
immediately following the merger  the holders of interstate s convertible debt and preferred equity shares converted those instruments into shares of our common stock 
immediately following the merger  we effected a one for five reverse split of our common stock the merger also included the following significant related transactions interstate repaid the outstanding balance on its promissory notes held by wyndham international  inc on july  and repaid the remaining principal balance of its limited recourse mortgage note on july   we entered into a new million senior credit agreement with a group of banks  and we converted meristar s unsecured credit facility and term note with meristar hospitality operating partnership  or mhop  to a term loan and repaid million under that loan 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the merger was treated as a purchase for financial reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  interstate was considered the acquiring enterprise for financial reporting purposes 
interstate established a new accounting basis for our assets and liabilities based upon their fair values as of july   the effective date of the merger 
we accounted for the merger as a reverse acquisition with interstate as the accounting acquirer and meristar as the surviving company for legal purposes 
the consolidated financial statements for the period january  through july   and for the years ended december  and  include the historical results of operations of interstate  the accounting acquiror 
after the merger on july   the financial statements include the operating results of the combined entity  interstate hotels resorts  inc business summary overview the meristar interstate merger combined the two largest independent hotel management companies in the united states  measured by number of rooms under management 
we now manage and operate a portfolio of hospitality properties and provide related services in the hotel  corporate housing  resort  conference center  and golf markets 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
the related services we provide include insurance and risk management services  purchasing and project management services  information technology and telecommunications services  and centralized accounting services 
as of december   we managed properties with  rooms in states  the district of columbia  canada  and russia 
we wholly own one of these properties and we have non controlling equity interests in of these hotels 
in addition  at december   our corporate housing operations had  apartments under lease in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and france 
our subsidiary operating partnerships indirectly hold substantially all of our assets 
we are the sole general partner of the partnerships 
we  one of our directors and certain independent third parties are limited partners of the partnerships 
the partnership agreements give the general partners full control over the business and affairs of the partnerships 
outlook the sluggish economy and delays and difficulties in travel due to heightened security measures at airports continue to have a major impact on our operating results 
since the slowdown of the economy over the past months  accelerated by the terrorist attacks on september   our managed hotels have experienced significant short term declines in occupancy and average rates changed 
weaker hotel performance has caused reduced management fees and also gives rise to additional losses under minority investments we have made in connection with hotels that we manage 
additionally  the weaker hotel operating environment has caused some owners of our managed hotels to sell hotels to provide the owners with additional liquidity 
when a hotel is sold  we are usually replaced as the hotel s manager 
meristar hospitality has announced plans to dispose of a number of non core hotels  all of which we currently manage  and other owners may also dispose of assets 
if we are terminated as manager upon the sale of one of meristar hospitality s hotels  we will receive a termination fee equal to the remaining payments discounted using a rate under the then existing term of the management agreement 
our management agreements with other owners generally have limited or no termination fees due to us if our management agreement is terminated upon the sale of the hotel 
the termination of management contracts as a result of hotel dispositions could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
the overall weak economy has also negatively impacted the demand for corporate relocations and long term assignments  two primary drivers of our corporate housing operations 
these events have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
in response to this current operating environment  we are continuing to work with the owners of our managed hotel properties to implement cost reduction and control measures to improve those properties operating results 
we are also seeking to closely monitor and control our commitments for leased rental units in our corporate housing division  in order to minimize our exposure to further declines in demand in this area 
relationship with meristar hospitality we manage all properties owned by meristar hospitality corporation  a real estate investment trust 
we also have an intercompany agreement with meristar hospitality 
that agreement provides each of us the right to participate in certain transactions entered into by the other company 
the intercompany agreement provides meristar hospitality with the right of first refusal with respect to some of our hotel real estate opportunities and it also provides us with a right of first refusal with respect to some of meristar hospitality s hotel management opportunities excluding hotels that meristar hospitality elects to have managed by a hotel brand owner 
we also provide each other with certain services including administrative  renovation supervision  corporate  accounting  finance  risk management  legal  tax  information technology  human resources  acquisition identification and diligence and operational services 
historically  we have had close operating  management and governance relationships with meristar hospitality 
we manage all of meristar hospitality s hotel properties under long term management contracts and have  in the past  shared several key management personnel and board members with meristar hospitality 
due to our merger with interstate hotels and our resulting increased scale  we and meristar hospitality have split the management teams of the two companies 
paul w 
whetsell is the chairman and chief executive officer of both companies and is the only executive shared by both companies  and we share two other board members with meristar hospitality 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and our financial reporting process and are based on our current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from our current judgments 
the most significant accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements relate to the evaluation of impairment of certain long lived assets  the evaluation of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets estimation of valuation allowances  specifically those related to income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts  estimates of restructuring and other accruals  the estimation of the fair value of our derivative instruments  and revenue recognition impairment of long lived assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets intangibles with definite useful lives may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we review long lived assets for impairment when one or more of the following events have occurred current or immediate short term future twelve months projected cash flows are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows 
a significant loss of management contracts without the realistic expectation of a replacement 
the unplanned departure of an executive officer or other key personnel  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain our competitive position and manage future growth 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  which could affect the value of the goodwill or other long lived assets 
events which could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
in  we formed two limited partnerships fch ihc hotels  lp and fch ihc leasing  lp with felcor lodging trust 
these partnerships own eight mid scale hotels  and we manage those eight hotels 
the partnership entities are owned by felcor and by us 
the hotels in the felcor partnerships have produced significantly below budget operating results in as a result we have evaluated the carrying value of these assets 
our review as of december  indicated that the future projected cash flows from the partnerships hotels is not sufficient to allow us to recover our investment in these partnerships  and we believe the decline to be other than temporary 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the investment to its estimated fair value of million 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at least annually  we perform an analysis to determine the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our intangible assets other than goodwill include our management contracts  finance costs and franchise fees 
to test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value 
we make estimates of the fair value of the intangible asset using discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the assets 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value  the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for goodwill in  or valuation allowances we use our judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we recorded a million valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to million  the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this is an allowance against some  but not all  of our recorded deferred tax assets 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
our estimates of taxable income require us to make assumptions about various factors that affect our operating results  such as economic conditions  consumer demand  competition and other factors 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
based on actual results or a revision in future estimates  we might determine that we would not be able to realize additional portions of our net deferred tax assets in the future  if that occurred  we would record a charge to the income tax provision in that period 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited by the tax provisions of the internal revenue code 
the valuation allowance we recorded included the effect of the limitations on our deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our judgment in determining the ability and willingness of our customers to make required payments 
our judgments in determining customers ability and willingness are based on past experience with customers and our assessment of the current and future operating environments for our customers 
if a customer s financial condition deteriorates or a management contract is terminated in the future  this could decrease a customer s ability or obligation to make payments 
if that occurred  we might have to make additional allowances  which could reduce our earnings 
restructuring and other accruals during  we recorded restructuring charges of million in conjunction with the meristar interstate merger 
these charges include estimated severance costs for employees whose positions have been relocated or eliminated and estimates on non cancelable lease costs at certain offices which will be closed down 
we accrued the total estimated cost of the restructuring at the time the plans were finalized and communicated to our employees 
these estimates require our judgment as to the outcome of net lease costs 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to adjust our financial statements when we identify the differences 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into derivative instruments for cash flow hedging purposes to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we have designated our interest rate swap agreements as hedges against changes in future cash flows associated with the interest payments of our variable rate debt obligations 
accordingly  we reflect the interest rate swap agreements at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and we record in stockholders equity the related unrealized gains and losses on these contracts 
we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
during september we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of october  on october  the swap agreement had a fair value of million 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from hotel management contracts and related services  corporate housing operations and operations from our owned hotel 
our management and other fees consist of base and incentive management fees received from third party owners of hotel properties  and fees for other related services we provide 
through the second quarter of  we had recorded incentive management fees in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and method no 
of emerging issues task force or eitf topic no 
d  accounting for management fees based on a formula in which incentive management fees are accrued as earned based on the profitability of the hotel  subject to the specific terms of each individual management agreement 
the application of method no 
resulted in the accrual of incentive management fees during interim reporting periods throughout the annual measurement period 
the accrual would be reduced or eliminated in subsequent interim reporting periods if the profitability of the hotel missed performance thresholds later in the annual measurement period 
this is an acceptable method of accounting for incentive management fees because the termination provisions specified in the management contracts provide for payment of prorated incentive management fees if the contract were to be terminated at any point within the year 
in the third quarter of  with an effective date of january   we began recording the incentive management fees in the period that it is certain the incentive management fees are earned  which for annual incentive fee measurements is typically in the last month of the annual contract period 
this newly adopted accounting principle is preferable in the circumstances because the new method eliminates the potential that incentive management fee revenue will be recognized in one interim reporting period and reduced or eliminated in a future interim reporting period 
this methodology is designated as method no 
in eitf topic no 
d method no 
is the securities and exchange commission staff s preferred method of accounting for incentive management fees 
this change in accounting method has no effect on the total annual management fees earned or amount of cash we are paid  but does affect the timing of recognizing the revenue from these fees during interim reporting periods 
however  the effect of this change in accounting method for interim periods resulted in a cumulative adjustment of million that reduced incentive management fees recognized during the first and second quarter of the effect of the change on the first quarter of was to increase the net loss by million per share to a net loss of million per share  the effect of the change on the second quarter of was to increase the net loss by million per share to a net loss of million per share

depreciation and amortization decreased by million  from million in to million in this decrease was partially due to the equity inns lease conversion that resulted in a non cash impairment loss of million in related to the carrying value of our long term intangible assets 
this loss reduced our investment in lease contracts and resulted in decreased amortization of million in in addition  as a result of the wyndham redemption in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reduction of the carrying value of long term intangible assets related to our investment in management agreements and resulted in decreased amortization of million in joint venture start up costs of million in relating to our joint venture with lehman brothers  net of a million reimbursement from the joint venture  include the legal  investment banking and other costs we incurred in connection with the start up of the joint venture 
the impairment loss of million in represents a non cash impairment charge on the non monetary exchange of our hotel lease contracts for management agreements 
as discussed above  the lease contracts for hotels previously leased from equity inns were terminated and we entered into management agreements for of the hotels formerly leased to us effective january  the impairment loss of million in represents a non cash impairment loss related to our non controlling equity interest in a partnership that owns the renaissance worldgate hotel in kissimmee  florida 
we recorded the impairment loss in the third quarter of as a result of a permanent impairment of the future profitability of this hotel 
since its acquisition in the fourth quarter of  the hotel had experienced lower than expected operating cash flows  primarily due to decreased occupancy rates and average daily room rates that affected this hotel and the orlando lodging market in general 
in addition  the weakness in the us economy during coupled with the severe downturn in the florida lodging market after the september th terrorist attacks had resulted in significant financial difficulties for the hotel 
as a result  the hotel was unable to satisfy debt service obligations  which resulted in mortgage defaults 
consequently  on february   the ownership and financing for the hotel were restructured in order to address the financial difficulties of the hotel 
as part of this restructuring  our non controlling equity interest was redeemed in exchange for mutual releases with respect to the obligations of the hotel 
in addition  the hotel owner and we amended the management agreement for the hotel  pursuant to which  among other things  we waived our management fees for the period from july  through february  and agreed to reduce our management fee for periods following february  as a result of the charges noted above  an operating loss of million was incurred in as compared to an operating loss of million in net loss available to common stockholders net loss available to common stockholders decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the majority of the decrease relates to the decrease in revenue of million and related expenses of million due to the equity inns lease conversion as discussed above

this was partially offset by the following losses from equity investments in hotel real estate were million in  compared to in in  this consisted of our proportionate share of the losses incurred by four non controlling equity investments in hotels 
these losses were incurred by the hotels due to the weakness in the us economy during and significant declines in occupancy following the september th terrorist attacks

as part of our management agreement services to a hotel owner  we generally obtain casualty insurance coverages for the hotel 
in december  one of the carriers we used to obtain casualty insurance coverages was downgraded significantly by rating agencies

we derived approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively  from services performed in canada  the united kingdom  france  and russia 
our foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  to date  since most of our foreign operations have been largely self contained we have not been exposed to material foreign exchange risk 
therefore  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the event that we have large transactions requiring currency conversion we would reevaluate whether we should engage in hedging activities
