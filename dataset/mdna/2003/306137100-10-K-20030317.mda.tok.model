item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meanin g of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securitie s exchange act of these forward looking statements can be identified by th e use of predictive  future tense or forward looking terminology  such a s believes  anticipates  expects  estimates  plans  may  intends  will  or similar terms 
investors are cautioned that any forward lookin g statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significan t risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially fro m those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussio n should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes t o those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview falconstor was incorporated in delaware for the purpose o f developing  manufacturing and selling network storage infrastructure softwar e solutions and providing related maintenance  implementation and engineerin g services 
our unique approach to storage networking enables companies to embrac e state of art equipment based on scsi  fibre channel or iscsi from any storag e manufacturer without rendering their existing or legacy solutions obsolete several strategic partners have recognized the industrial strength of ou r flagship software  ipstor r  and utilized it to power their special purpos e storage appliances to perform real time data migration  data replication  an d other advanced storage services 
ipstor leverages high performance ip or f c based networks to help corporate it aggregate storage capacity and contain th e run away cost of administering mission critical storage services such a s snapshot  backup  data replication  and other storage services  in a distribute d environment 
over customers around the world have deployed ipstor in th e production environment to manage storage infrastructure with minimal tco tota l cost of ownership and optimal roi return on investment 
from march through may  we received net proceeds o f approximately million from the sale of our preferred stock which converte d into approximately million shares of our common stock 
our operations fro m inception through the second quarter of were mainly comprised of th e development of our core network storage infrastructure software product 
durin g and the first two quarters of  we were in the development stage o f operations  and  as a result there were no significant revenues generated fro m our planned principal operations 
during the second quarter of  w e completed the development of our principal product and released our software 
w e began to earn our first significant revenues from software licenses in the thir d quarter of on august   we merged with npi  a publicly traded company for more information relating to the merger with npi  including the accountin g treatment  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
on july   we acquired ip metrics  a provider of intelligen t trunking software for mission critical networks 
for more information relatin g to the acquisition of ip metrics  including the accounting treatment  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those related to revenu e recognition 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  w e recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of positio n  software revenue recognition  as amended 
software license revenue i s recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee i s fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract for nonrefundable royalty advances received from oem s or a customer purchase order for each software license resold by an oem distributor or solution provider to an end user 
the software license fees ar e fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of ou r customers extended payment terms 
when a customer licenses software togethe r with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee t o maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewa l rate 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e year ended december  revenues software license revenue software license revenue is comprised of software licenses sol d through our oem s  value added resellers and distributors to end users and  to a lesser extent directly to the end user 
these revenues are recognized when among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order and the softwar e and permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
we also receiv e nonrefundable royalty advances from some of our oem partners 
these arrangement s are evidenced by a signed customer contract  and the revenue is recognized whe n the software product master is delivered and accepted 
software license revenue increased to million in fro m million in the increase in software license revenue was partially du e to the release of our principal product at the end of the second quarter o f therefore in  we only had two full quarters of software licens e revenue compared to a full year of revenue in another reason for th e increase in software license revenues was due to increased market acceptance o f our product as well as an increase in the number of our channel partners 
software services and other revenue software services and other revenues are comprised of softwar e maintenance and technical support  professional services primarily related t o the implementation of our software  engineering services  and to a lesser exten t sales of computer hardware 
revenue derived from maintenance and technica l support contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the relate d services are performed 
engineering services are primarily related t o customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue fro m engineering services is recognized in the period the services are completed 
i n  we had a limited number of transactions in which we purchased hardware an d bundled this hardware with our software and sold the bundled solution to ou r customer 
the associated revenue was recognized when the hardware was delivere d to the customer 
software services and other revenue increased to million in from million in the primary reason for the increas e in service and other revenue is related to an increase in the number of ou r maintenance and technical support contracts 
since our software was onl y released at the end of the second quarter of  we had limited maintenanc e and technical support revenue in cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of personnel and other cost s associated with providing software implementations  technical support unde r maintenance contracts  and training  all associated with software services an d other revenue  above 
cost of revenues also includes the cost of the purchase d hardware  which is included in software services and other revenue  above 
th e amortization of purchased software licenses and capitalized software developmen t costs  which is associated with software license revenue  is also included i n cost of revenues 
the amortization of purchased licenses for existing softwar e products is recorded as software development expense until the modified produc t is available for resale  and thereafter is recorded in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in the main reason for the increase in cost of revenues is due to the increase in revenues 
as a result of the increase in revenues  we required a higher average number of employees to provide technical support under our maintenance contracts and to help deploy our software 
in addition  amortizatio n of purchased software licenses was million in as compared with  of capitalized software in the hardware costs associated with hardware revenue amounted to million in there were no hardware costs in gross profit for the year ended december  was millio n or compared with million or for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was due to the increase in software licens e revenues  which have a higher gross margin than software services 
the absolut e dollar increase in gross profit was due to the increase in total revenu e compared to the prior year 
software development costs software development costs consist primarily of personnel costs fo r product development personnel and other related costs associated with th e development of new products  enhancements to existing products  qualit y assurance and testing 
software development costs increased to millio n in from million in the increase in software development cost s was partially due to an increase in development personnel 
the increase i n employees was required to enhance and test our core network storage softwar e product  as well as to develop new innovative features and options 
during we released versions and of ipstor and began work on version another reason for the increase is related to the amortization of purchase d software licenses that we further developed during the period 
the amortizatio n of these licenses is recorded as software development expense until the modifie d product is available for resale and then the expenses are recorded in cost o f revenues 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales an d marketing personnel and related costs  travel  public relations expense marketing literature and promotions  commissions  trade show expenses  and th e costs associated with our foreign sales offices 
selling and marketing expense s increased to million in from million in this increas e in selling and marketing expenses was due to our product being released durin g the end of the second quarter of as a result of this release  we expande d our sales force to accommodate our revenue growth and we initiated our marketin g efforts to promote our product and create brand awareness 
in addition  as a result of the increase in revenues our commission expense increased 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personne l costs of general and administrative functions  public company related fees directors and officers insurance  legal and professional fees and other genera l corporate overhead costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased t o million in from million in the decrease in general an d administrative expenses was due to a non cash consulting expense for optio n grants and higher legal fees in these amounts were partially offset by a significant increase in premiums for directors and officers insurance in interest and other income interest and other income increased to million in fro m million in this increase in interest income was due to higher averag e cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as a result of th e merger with npi 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our development and now early stage operations accordingly  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred ta x assets 
impairment of long lived and other assets in october  we entered into an agreement with network security solutions  inc nssi  a publicly traded company  whereby million was paid to nssi  of which million was for the purchase o f convertible preferred stock of nssi accounted for under the cost method  an d million was for a non refundable prepaid royalty recoupable against futur e product sales of nssi s product 
primarily due to the decline since may i n the market value of nssi s common stock underlying the convertible preferre d stock significantly below the company s cost  we have concluded the decline i n the fair value of our investment in nssi s preferred stock is other tha n temporary 
accordingly  in we recorded an impairment charge to write of f our investment in nssi preferred stock 
in addition  due to the lack of marke t acceptance of the nssi product in its current state  we concluded that th e unrecouped prepaid royalty is not recoverable and it was written off 
as a result  in  we recorded a million charge for the impairment o f long lived and other assets related to our nssi agreement  of which millio n was an operating expense 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to th e period from inception february  through december  revenues software license revenue software license revenue was million in for the perio d from inception february  through december  there was n o software license revenue since our principal product was not released until th e end of the second quarter of software services and other revenue software services and other revenue increased to million i n from million for the period from inception february  throug h december  the increase in software services and other revenue was du e to our principal product being released at the end of the second quarter o f as a result  we earned software implementation revenues  engineerin g services revenues related to customizing software product masters for our oe m partners  and maintenance and technical support revenues associated with ou r software license revenues 
for the period from inception february  through december   software services and other revenues were related t o network consulting services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in from millio n in the main reason for the increase in cost of revenues was due to th e increase in revenues 
as a result of the increase in revenues  we increased ou r average number of technical support and consulting employees 
gross profit loss for the year ended december  was million or compared with  or for the period from inceptio n february  through december  the increase in gross margin wa s due to the increase in software license revenues  which have a higher gros s margin than network consulting fees 
in  the cost of employee compensatio n exceeded revenues earned 
software development costs software development costs were million for the year ende d december  compared with million for the period from inceptio n february  through december  the million increase fro m the prior year was mainly due to an increase in development personnel 
th e increase in employees was required to develop our initial core storag e networking infrastructure software product  as well as to develop new innovativ e features and options 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased from approximately  for the period from inception february  through december  t o million for the year ended december  this increase in selling an d marketing expenses was due to our product being released during the end of th e second quarter of as a result of this release  we expanded our sales forc e to accommodate our revenue growth and we initiated our marketing efforts t o promote our product and to create brand awareness 
selling and marketin g expenses were limited in since our product had not yet been released 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the yea r ended december   an increase of approximately million from th e period from inception february  through december  th e increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased salaries a s a result of increased personnel associated with building our basic corporat e infrastructure 
additionally  as a public company  in we began to incu r additional legal and professional fees and corporate directors and officer s insurance expense 
interest and other income interest and other income was million for the year ende d december  compared with approximately  for the period fro m inception february  through december  the millio n increase in interest income was due to higher average cash  cash equivalent an d marketable securities balances as a result of the merger with npi  as well a s the cash we raised from the issuance of series c convertible preferred stock 
income taxes we did not record a tax benefit associated with the pre tax los s incurred from the period from inception february  through december  as we deemed that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset s will not be realized based on our development and now early stage operations and accordingly  we provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred ta x asset 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketabl e securities totaled million at december  as of december  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million i n marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  this was primarily a result of ou r net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable and prepai d expenses and other current assets  and a decrease in accounts payable 
thes e amounts were partially offset by non cash charges of million consisting o f depreciation and amortization  non cash professional services expenses equity based compensation and impairment of long lived and other assets  i n addition to increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
net cash used i n operating activities for the year ended december  was million this was mainly attributable to our net loss of million partially offse t by non cash expenses of million and increases in accounts payable  accrue d expenses and deferred revenue 
the increase in net cash used was als o attributable to increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and othe r current assets 
for the period from inception february  throug h december  the net cash used of million was mainly attributable t o our net loss of million partially offset by non cash expenses of million and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferre d revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  du e primarily to net purchases of marketable securities of million  net cas h paid for acquisitions of million  purchases of property and equipment o f million and purchase of investments  software licenses and intangibl e assets 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the yea r ended december   due primarily to the million of net cash acquire d from the merger with npi 
these amounts were partially offset by net purchase s of marketable securities of million  million in purchases of propert y and equipment  million related to the purchase of software licenses and a million investment in preferred stock of another entity which wa s subsequently written off 
see note of notes to consolidated financia l statements 
for the period from inception february  through decembe r  the net cash used by investing activities of million wa s attributable to purchases of property and equipment of million an d approximately million in security deposits 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for th e year ended december   which was comprised of million related t o proceeds from exercise of stock options offset by million in payments t o acquire treasury stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  which was comprised of millio n raised from our series c preferred stock financing and approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
these amounts were partially offse t by the repurchase of treasury stock totaling million 
for the period fro m inception february  through december   cash provided b y financing activities was million  primarily from the issuance of series a and b preferred stock 
for the year ended december  and  we paid millio n and million  respectively  related to discontinued operations 
as of december   we had million of liabilities relate d to the discontinued operations of npi 
see note to the audited consolidate d financial statements 
in october  our board of directors authorized the repurchase o f up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock  of which  shares were repurchased through december   at an aggregate purchas e price of million 
in connection with our acquisition of ip metrics in july  w e are required to make cash payments to the former shareholders of ip metrics which are contingent on the level of revenues from ip metrics products for a period of twenty four months subsequent to the acquisition 
as of december  the company has accrued million of additional purchase consideratio n related to sales of ip metrics products 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents an d marketable securities  which are expected to be used for general corporat e purposes  including expansion of operations and capital expenditures 
we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents an d marketable securities  and expected cash flows from operations will b e sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accountin g standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposa l activities sfas no 
 which is effective for exit or disposal activitie s initiated after december  sfas no 
applies to costs associated wit h an exit activity including restructuring costs or with a disposal o f long lived assets 
companies will be required to record an expense when a liability for an exit or disposal activity is incurred and can be measured a t fair value 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accountin g and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees o f indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be mad e by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certai n guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fai r value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin clarifies th e requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating t o guarantees 
in general  fin applies to contracts or indemnificatio n agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to th e guaranteed party based on changes in a specified interest rate  security price foreign exchange rate or other variable that is related to an asset  liability or equity security of the guaranteed party  or failure of another party t o perform under an obligating agreement performance guarantees 
certai n guarantee contracts are excluded from both the disclosure and recognitio n requirements of this interpretation  including  among others  guarantee s relating to employee compensation  residual value guarantees under capital leas e arrangements  commercial letters of credit  loan commitments  subordinate d interests in a special purpose entity  and guarantees of a company s own futur e performance 
other guarantees are subject to the disclosure requirements of fi n but not to the recognition provisions and include  among others  a guarante e accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 and a guarante e covering product performance  not product price 
the disclosure requirements o f fin are effective for the company as of december   and requir e disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount o f future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under th e guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin are t o be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december certain guarantees included in software license agreements that have bee n entered into by the company are disclosed in note in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accountin g standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition an d disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting fo r stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock base d employee compensation transition provisions 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require proforma disclosure i n interim financial statements by companies that elect to account for stock base d compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
disclosure provisions 
the transition methods of sfas no 
are effectiv e for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  th e company continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting fo r stock based compensation 
as a result  the transition provisions do not have a n effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company ha s adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
risk factors we have had limited revenues and a history of losses  and we may not achieve o r maintain profitability 
due to the early stage of our product  we have had limited revenue s and a history of losses 
for the years ended december  and  we ha d revenues of million and million  respectively 
the increase in ou r revenues from to is primarily due to the release of our principa l product at the end of the second quarter of for the period from inceptio n february  through december  and for the year ended decembe r   we had a net loss of million and million  respectively 
w e have signed contracts with resellers and original equipment manufacturers  o r oems  and believe that as a result of these contracts  our revenues shoul d increase in the future 
our business model depends upon signing agreements wit h additional oem customers  further developing our reseller sales channel  an d expanding our direct sales force 
any difficulty in obtaining these oem an d reseller customers or in attracting qualified sales personnel will hinder ou r ability to generate additional revenues and achieve or maintain profitability 
failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business and operatin g results 
achieving our anticipated growth will depend on a number of factors some of which include o retention of key management  marketing and technical personnel  o our ability to increase our customer base and to increase the sales of ou r products  and o competitive conditions in the storage networking infrastructure softwar e market 
we cannot assure you that the anticipated growth will be achieved the failure to achieve anticipated growth could harm our business  financia l condition and operating results 
due to the uncertain and shifting development of the network storag e infrastructure software market  we may have difficulty accurately predictin g revenue for future periods and appropriately budgeting for expenses 
due to the early stage of our product  we have only a limite d history from which to predict our revenue 
this limited operating experience combined with the rapidly evolving nature of the network storage infrastructur e software market in which we sell our products and other factors that are beyon d our control  reduces our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly and annua l revenue 
however  we use our forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance o f anticipated revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to decrease our expenses i n a timely manner to offset any shortfall in revenue 
global economic conditions may continue to erode  which could result i n decreased revenues 
the macroeconomic environment and capital spending on informatio n technology have continued to erode  resulting in continued uncertainty in ou r revenue expectations 
the operating results of our business depend on th e overall demand for network storage infrastructure software 
because our sale s are primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses fluctuate wit h general economic and business conditions  continued soft demand for networ k storage infrastructure software caused by a weakening economy and budgetar y constraints may result in decreased revenues 
customers may continue to defer o r to reconsider purchasing our software if they continue to experience a lack o f growth in their business or if the general economy fails to significantl y improve  resulting in a lack of demand for our product 
the markets for storage area networks  network attached storage  and direc t attached storage are new and uncertain  and our business will suffer if they d o not develop as we expect 
the rapid adoption of storage area networks san  network attache d storage nas  and direct attached storage das storage solutions is critica l to our future success 
the markets for san  nas and das solutions are stil l unproven  making it difficult to predict their potential sizes or future growt h rates 
most potential customers have made substantial investments in thei r current storage networking infrastructure  and they may elect to remain wit h current network architectures or to adopt new architecture  in limited stages o r over extended periods of time 
we are uncertain whether a viable market for ou r products will develop or be sustainable 
if these markets fail to develop  o r develop more slowly than we expect  our business  financial condition an d results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we are unable to develop and manufacture new products that achieve acceptanc e in the network storage infrastructure software market  our operating results ma y suffer 
the network storage infrastructure software market continues t o evolve and as a result there is continuing demand for new products 
accordingly we may need to develop and manufacture new products that address additiona l network storage infrastructure software market segments and emergin g technologies to remain competitive in the data storage software industry 
we ar e uncertain whether we will successfully qualify new network storag e infrastructure software products with our customers by meeting custome r performance and quality specifications or quickly achieve high volume productio n of storage networking infrastructure software products 
any failure to addres s additional market segments could harm our business  financial condition an d operating results 
our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted b y customers in our markets 
our current products are only one part of a san  nas or das storag e system 
all components of these systems must comply with the same industr y standards in order to operate together efficiently 
we depend on companies tha t provide other components of these systems to conform to industry standards 
som e industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly  an d competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by oem customers or en d users 
if other providers of components do not support the same industr y standards as we do  or if competing standards emerge  our products may no t achieve market acceptance  which would adversely affect our business 
our complex products may have errors or defects that could result in reduce d demand for our products or costly litigation 
our ipstor platform is complex and is designed to be deployed i n large and complex networks 
many of our customers have unique infrastructures which may require additional professional services in order for our software t o work within their infrastructure 
because our products are critical to th e networks of our customers  any significant interruption in their service as a result of defects in our product within our customers networks could result i n lost profits or damage to our customers 
these problems could cause us to incu r significant service and warranty costs  divert engineering personnel fro m product development efforts and significantly impair our ability to maintai n existing customer relationships and attract new customers 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether successful or not  would likely be tim e consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time an d attention 
further  if we are unable to fix the errors or other problems tha t may be identified in full deployment  we would likely experience loss of o r delay in revenues and loss of market share and our business and prospects woul d suffer 
our oem customers require our products to undergo a lengthy and expensiv e qualification process that does not assure product sales 
prior to offering our products for sale  our oem customers requir e that each of our products undergo an extensive qualification process  whic h involves interoperability testing of our product in the oem s system as well a s rigorous reliability testing 
this qualification of a product by an oem does no t assure any sales of the product to the oem 
despite this uncertainty  we devot e substantial resources  including sales  marketing and management efforts  towar d qualifying our products with oems in anticipation of sales to them 
if we ar e unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any products with an oem  such failure o r delay would preclude or delay sales of that product to the oem  which may imped e our ability to grow our business 
the network storage infrastructure software market is highly competitive an d intense competition could negatively impact our business 
the network storage infrastructure software market is intensel y competitive even during periods when demand is stable 
some of our current an d potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greate r resources  broader name recognition and a larger installed base of customer s than we have 
those competitors and other potential competitors may be able t o establish or to expand network storage infrastructure software offerings mor e quickly  adapt to new technologies and customer requirements faster  and tak e advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily 
our competitors also may o consolidate or establish strategic relationships among themselves to lowe r their product costs or to otherwise compete more effectively against us or o bundle their products with other products to increase demand for thei r products 
in addition  some oems with whom we do business  or hope to do business  ma y enter the market directly and rapidly capture market share 
if we fail t o compete successfully against current or future competitors  our business financial condition and operating results may suffer 
our future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause ou r stock price to decline 
our future performance will depend on many factors  including o the timing of securing software license contracts and the delivery o f software and related revenue recognition  o the average unit selling price of our products  o existing or new competitors introducing better products at competitiv e prices before we do  o our ability to manage successfully the complex and difficult process o f qualifying our products with our customers  o our customers canceling  rescheduling or deferring significant orders fo r our products  particularly in anticipation of new products or enhancement s from us or our competitors  o import or export restrictions on our proprietary technology  and o personnel changes 
many of our expenses are relatively fixed and difficult to reduce o r modify 
as a result  the fixed nature of our expenses will magnify any advers e effect of a decrease in revenue on our operating results 
our board of directors may selectively release shares of our common stock fro m lock up restrictions 
currently  approximately million shares of our common stock ar e subject to contractual lock up restrictions expiring on april   an d approximately million shares of our common stock are subject to contractua l lock up restrictions expiring on april  our board of directors may  i n its sole discretion  release any or all of the shares of our common stock fro m lock up restrictions at any time with or without notice 
any release of suc h shares from lock up restrictions may be applied on a proportionate or selectiv e basis 
if the release is selectively applied  the stockholders whose shares ar e not released will be forced to hold such shares while other stockholders ma y sell 
in addition  the release of any of such shares could depress our stoc k price 
our board of directors has agreed to a phased release of up t o approximately million shares between november  and april  from the shares that are subject to contractual lock up restrictions expiring o n april  our stock price may be volatile the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past an d may be volatile in the future 
for example  during the year ended december  the market price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq nationa l market system fluctuated between and 
the market price of ou r common stock may be significantly affected by the following factors o actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  o failure to meet financial estimates  o changes in market valuations of other technology companies particularly those in the storage networking infrastructur e software market  o announcements by us or our competitors of significant technica l innovations  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint venture s or capital commitments  o loss of one or more key oem customers  and o departures of key personnel 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has bee n unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuation s may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our performance 
we have a significant amount of authorized but unissued preferred stock  whic h may affect the likelihood of a change of control in our company 
our board of directors has the authority  without further action by th e stockholders  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock on such term s and with such rights  preferences and designations  including  withou t limitation restricting dividends on our common stock  dilution of the votin g power of our common stock and impairing the liquidation rights of the holders o f our common stock  as the board may determine without any vote of th e stockholders 
issuance of such preferred stock  depending upon the rights preferences and designations thereof may have the effect of delaying  deterrin g or preventing a change in control 
in addition  certain anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  among other things  ma y restrict the ability of our stockholders to authorize a merger  busines s combination or change of control 
finally  we have entered into change o f control agreements with certain executives 
we have a significant number of outstanding options  the exercise of which woul d dilute the then existing stockholders percentage ownership of our common stock as of december   we have outstanding options to purchase a n aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercis e price of per share 
the exercise of all of the outstanding options would dilute th e then existing stockholders percentage ownership of common stock  and any sale s in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such exercise coul d adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock 
moreover  th e terms upon which we would be able to obtain additional equity capital could b e adversely affected because the holders of such securities can be expected t o exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able t o obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided by suc h securities 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business will suffer our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
currently the ipstor software suite is the core of our proprietary technology 
we hav e nine pending patent applications and multiple pending trademark application s related to our ipstor product 
we cannot predict whether we will receive patent s for our pending or future patent applications  and any patents that we own o r that are issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
i n addition  the laws of certain countries in which we sell and manufacture ou r products  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products an d intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the unite d states 
we also rely on trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well a s the confidentiality and other restrictions contained in our respective sale s contracts and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights these legal protections afford only limited protection 
our technology may be subject to infringement claims that could harm ou r business 
we may become subject to litigation regarding infringement claim s alleged by third parties 
if an action is commenced against us  our managemen t may have to devote substantial attention and resources to defend these claims an unfavorable result for the company could have a material adverse effect o n our business  financial condition and operating results and could limit ou r ability to use our intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may cause us to become involve d in costly and lengthy litigation  which could seriously harm our business
