item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three year period ended december  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis 
general we are a leading north american manufacturer of metal and plastic consumer goods packaging products 
we currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and custom designed plastic containers  tubes and closures for personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical products  and metal  composite and plastic closures for food and beverage products 
we are the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in north america  with a unit sale market share for the year ended december  of approximately percent in the united states  a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in north america for personal care products and a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
sales growth our objective is to increase shareholder value through efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business and reduce costs of existing operations and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns 
we have increased sales and market share in our metal food container and plastic container businesses through acquisitions and internal growth 
as a result  we have expanded and diversified our customer base  geographic presence and product lines 
during the past fifteen years  the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self manufacture their metal food containers 
our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of nestle  dial  del monte  birds eye and campbell  as well as our recently announced acquisition of pcp can manufacturing  reflect this trend 
we have improved the market position of our plastic container business since  with sales increasing more than fivefold to million in we achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions  including most recently thatcher tubes  as well as through internal growth 
the plastic container business of the consumer goods packaging industry is highly fragmented  and we intend to pursue further consolidation opportunities in this market 
we also believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and operating expertise to new markets of the consumer goods packaging industry 
with our acquisition of thatcher tubes in january  we extended our business into decorated plastic tubes primarily for personal care products to complement our plastic container business 
additionally  with our acquisition of rxi in october  we expanded our business into plastic closures  caps  sifters and fitments and thermoformed plastic tubs 
we expect to continue to generate internal growth in our plastic container business 
for example  we intend to aggressively market our decorated plastic tubes and plastic closures to existing customers of our plastic container business 
additionally  we intend to continue to expand our customer base in the markets that we serve  such as the personal care  health care  pharmaceutical  household and industrial chemical  food  pet care  agricultural chemical  automotive and marine chemical markets 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in white cap that we did not already own 
the business is a leading manufacturer of metal and plastic vacuum closures in north america for food and beverage products 
in  the business had approximately million of net sales 
operating performance we use a disciplined approach to acquire businesses that generate attractive cash returns and enhance profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
the additional sales and production capacity provided through acquisitions have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings 
in addition  our acquisitions have enabled us to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling and minimizing product transportation costs 
we have also benefited from our economies of scale and from the elimination of redundant selling and administrative functions 
in addition to the benefits realized through the integration of acquired businesses  we have improved the operating performance of our existing plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements and manufacturing cost reductions 
during  our metal food container business entered into a long term technical agreement with daiwa can company  or daiwa  of tokyo  japan 
daiwa is a major producer of metal food and beverage containers as well as plastic containers for cosmetics and foods in japan  and our relationship with daiwa gives us access to new products  manufacturing processes and materials technologies that have been exclusively developed by daiwa 
we have also invested capital for new market opportunities  such as convenience ends for metal food containers 
over the past five years  we have invested million in capital to maintain our market position  improve our productivity  reduce our manufacturing costs and invest in new market opportunities 
we operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure 
recently  our plastic container business began to experience increased competitive pressures 
for example  some customers have consolidated and are placing larger portions of their business up for competitive bidding 
historically  we have been successful in renewing our multi year supply arrangements with our customers 
in  we extended the term of our supply agreements with various customers in return for price adjustments 
further  the multi year supply agreements that we enter into with many of our customers limit our ability to increase our margins 
we estimate that approximately percent of our projected metal food container sales in and a majority of our projected plastic container sales in will be under multi year arrangements 
many of these multi year supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in material  labor and other manufacturing costs  thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs 
our metal food container business sales and  to a lesser extent  operating income are dependent  in part  upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the united states 
the size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year  depending in large part upon the weather conditions in those regions 
because of the seasonality of the harvests  we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter 
this seasonal impact has been mitigated somewhat by the acquisition of cs can from campbell 
sales to campbell generally have been highest in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal demand for soup products 
use of capital we use leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns 
our stable and predictable cash flow  generated largely as a result of our multi year customer contracts and generally recession resistant business  supports our financial strategy 
we intend to continue using leverage  supported by our stable cash flows  to make value enhancing acquisitions 
in the absence of attractive acquisition opportunities  we intend to use our free cash flow to repay indebtedness or for other permitted purposes 
for example  we did not complete any acquisitions during or  and over that period we reduced our total debt by million and increased our cash balances by million 
to the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods  our interest expense may increase 
further  since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at floating rates  our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and  accordingly  our interest expense may vary from period to period 
after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations  at december  we had million of indebtedness which bore interest at floating rates 
in light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense 
for  our aggregate interest and other debt expense was percent of our income from operations as compared to percent  percent  percent and percent for   and  respectively 
in april  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of our debentures  the proceeds of which were used to repay revolving loans under our previous us senior secured credit facility  or the us credit agreement 
in june  we refinanced the us credit agreement by entering into a new million senior secured credit facility  or the new credit agreement 
the new credit agreement also provides us with an incremental uncommitted term loan facility of up to an additional million million of which has been borrowed as described below which may be used to finance acquisitions and for other permitted purposes 
the new credit agreement provides increased flexibility to  among other things  make acquisitions  pay dividends and incur additional debt 
under the new credit agreement  the interest rate for all loans will be either the eurodollar rate plus a margin or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank trust company americas  or deutsche bank  plus a margin 
initially  the margin for eurodollar rate loans is percent and the margin for prime rate loans is percent 
under the us credit agreement  the interest rate for a term loans and revolving loans was the eurodollar rate plus a margin of percent or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank 
for b term loans  the interest rate was the eurodollar rate plus a margin of percent or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank plus a margin of percent 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of thatcher tubes  a privately held manufacturer and marketer of decorated plastic tubes serving primarily the personal care industry 
thatcher tubes operates manufacturing facilities in woodstock  illinois and culiacan  mexico and had net sales of approximately million in the purchase price  including additional production capacity recently installed and currently being installed  was approximately million in cash 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in white cap that we did not already own for million in cash and refinanced approximately million of debt of the business 
in march  we also completed a million incremental term loan borrowing under the new credit agreement largely to finance the acquisitions of white cap and thatcher tubes 
white cap joint venture effective july   we formed a joint venture company with schmalbach lubeca ag that is a leading supplier of an extensive range of metal and plastic closures to consumer goods packaging companies in the food and beverage industries in north america 
the venture operated under the name amcor white cap llc 
we contributed million of metal closure assets  including our manufacturing facilities in evansville and richmond  indiana  and million of metal closure liabilities to white cap in return for a percent interest in and million of cash proceeds from the joint venture 
net sales of our metal closure business  which was contributed to the white cap joint venture  totaled million and million in and  respectively 
schmalbach lubeca ag contributed the remaining metal and plastic closure operations to the joint venture 
in july  amcor ltd 
purchased schmalbach lubeca ag s interest in the joint venture 
during  we recorded equity in losses of white cap of million  net of income taxes 
as part of the integration of the contributed businesses  the white cap joint venture instituted a program to rationalize its operations 
as a result  our equity in losses of white cap for included million  net of income taxes  for our portion of white cap s rationalization charge to close its chicago  illinois metal closure manufacturing facility and million  net of income taxes  for our portion of white cap s gain on the sale of certain assets at a price in excess of book value 
during  we recorded equity in losses of white cap of million and a gain on the assets contributed to the joint venture of million 
in march  we acquired the remaining percent equity interest in white cap that we did not already own for million in cash and refinanced approximately million of debt of the business 
the business is headquartered in chicago and presently operates seven manufacturing facilities located in athens  georgia  champaign  illinois  west hazleton  pennsylvania  evansville  indiana  richmond  indiana  chicago  illinois  and queretaro  mexico 
the business operates as part of our metal food container business due to similarities in end use markets 
net sales for the business were approximately million in packtion investment in april  we  together with morgan stanley private equity and diamondcluster international  inc  agreed to invest in packtion corporation  or packtion  an e commerce joint venture aimed at integrating the packaging supply chain  from design through manufacture and procurement 
the parties agreed to make the investments through packaging markets llc  a limited liability company 
the joint venture was expected to provide a comprehensive online marketplace for packaging goods and services and to combine content  tools and collaboration capabilities to streamline the product development process and enhance transaction opportunities for buyers and sellers of packaging 
the products that packtion was developing included a web based software tool to enable product and package design  development and collaboration  an internet based secure environment enabling the sharing of packaging related product information and the transaction of business electronically  and an informational source of packaging related knowledge  tools and expert services 
packtion had insignificant sales for internet consulting services and incurred net losses 
in june and august  we invested a total of million in packtion representing approximately a percent interest in packtion 
for the year ended december   we recorded equity in losses of packtion of million 
in the first quarter of in connection with an investment by the procter gamble company and ei du pont de nemours co 
in packtion  we invested an additional million  bringing our total investment to million representing approximately a percent interest in packtion 
packtion was dissolved on may  after its board of directors determined that there had been slower than anticipated market acceptance of its business 
during  we recorded equity in losses of packtion aggregating million  which included our final losses and eliminated our investment

capital resources and liquidity our principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and corporate borrowings under our revolving loan facilities 
our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness  capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs 
on april   we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of our debentures 
the newly issued debentures were an add on issuance under the indenture for our existing debentures originally issued in june and have identical terms to the existing debentures 
the issue price for the new debentures was of their principal amount 
net cash proceeds received from this issuance were approximately million  after deducting selling commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
the net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay a portion of our revolving loan obligations under the us credit agreement 
on june   we completed the refinancing of the us credit agreement by entering into a new million senior secured credit facility 
the new credit agreement provided us with million of a term loans and million of b term loans  and also provides us with up to million of revolving loans 
under the new credit agreement  we may use revolving loans for working capital and other operating needs as well as for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
the new credit agreement also provides us with an incremental uncommitted term loan facility of up to an additional million million of which has been borrowed as described below which may be used to finance acquisitions and for other permitted purposes 
on march   we completed a million incremental term loan borrowing under the new credit agreement 
the proceeds were used largely to finance the acquisitions of white cap and thatcher tubes 
the terms of the incremental term loans are the same as those for b term loans under the new credit agreement 
in  we used proceeds of million from the add on issuance of debentures  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from stock option exercises of million and proceeds from asset sales of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of revolving loans and long term debt of million and debt issuance costs of million and to increase cash balances by million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net decreased million to million as compared to  primarily due to the timing of sales 
inventories increased million to million in as compared to primarily due to the timing of sales and raw material purchases 
in  we used cash generated from operations of million  cash proceeds from the white cap joint venture of million  proceeds from asset sales of million  cash balances of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to fund capital expenditures of million  net repayments of revolving loans and long term debt of million and our investment in packtion of million 
in  trade accounts receivable  net decreased million to million as compared to primarily due to the impact of contributing our metal closure business to the white cap joint venture and the impact of a few customers delaying payments in until the beginning of inventories decreased million to million in as compared to primarily due to the impact of contributing our metal closure business to the white cap joint venture and the timing of raw material purchases and business requirements 
trade accounts payable decreased million to million principally due to the timing of payments and raw material purchases 
in  we used net borrowings of revolving loans of million million under the us credit agreement and million under our canadian senior secured credit facility  cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from asset sales of million and proceeds from stock option exercises of million to fund the acquisition of rxi for million  capital expenditures of million  redemption of the debentures for million  repayment of million of term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities  cash balances of million  our investment in packtion of million  repurchases of common stock of million and debt issuance costs of million 
in december  we redeemed all of our outstanding debentures million principal amount with lower cost revolving loans under the us credit agreement 
the redemption price for all of the debentures  including premiums  was million 
we benefited from this redemption because of the lower interest rate applicable to the revolving loans  despite the slight increase in our indebtedness as a result 
as of december   there were no revolving loans outstanding under the new credit agreement  and  after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the available portion of the revolving loan facility under the new credit agreement was million 
revolving loans under the new credit agreement may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed until their final maturity on june  additionally  as of december   there were no outstanding revolving loans under our canadian senior secured credit facility  and after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  the available portion of the revolving loan facility under our canadian senior secured credit facility was million 
the new credit agreement also provided us with a term loans million outstanding at december  and b term loans million outstanding at december   which are required to be repaid in annual installments through june  and november   respectively 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
under the new credit agreement  the interest rate for all loans will be either the eurodollar rate plus a margin or the prime lending rate of deutsche bank plus a margin 
initially  the margin for eurodollar rate loans is two percent and the margin for prime rate loans is one percent 
starting in  the margins are subject to adjustment quarterly based upon financial ratios set forth in the new credit agreement 
because we sell metal containers used in fruit and vegetable pack processing  we have seasonal sales 
as is common in the industry  we must access working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the summer and fall packing season 
seasonal accounts are generally settled by year end 
due to our seasonal requirements  we incur short term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements 
for  we estimate that we will utilize approximately million of revolving loans under our senior secured credit facilities for our peak seasonal working capital requirements 
we may use the available portion of our revolving loan facilities  after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit  for acquisitions and other permitted purposes 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
as of december   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
the repurchases were financed through revolving loan borrowings under the us credit agreement 
we intend to finance future repurchases  if any  of our common stock with revolving loans from the new credit agreement 
in addition to our operating cash needs  we believe our cash requirements over the next few years taking into account recent acquisitions will consist primarily of o annual capital expenditures of to million  o annual principal amortization payments of bank term loans under the new credit agreement taking into account the recent incremental term loan borrowings of million  o our interest requirements  including interest on revolving loans the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements and bank term loans under the new credit agreement  which bear fluctuating rates of interest  and the debentures  and o payments of approximately million for federal  state and foreign tax liabilities in  which will increase annually thereafter 
we believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under our senior secured credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  planned capital expenditures  debt service and tax obligations for the foreseeable future 
we are also continually evaluating and pursuing acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness  including indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities  to finance any such acquisition 
our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture with respect to the debentures contain restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur debt  sell assets and engage in certain transactions 
we do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations 
we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during with all of these covenants 
our contractual cash obligations at december  are provided below without taking into account the recent incremental term loan borrowings payments due by period total thereafter long term debt minimum rental commitments total contractual cash obligations 
 at december   we also had outstanding letters of credit of million that were issued under our senior secured credit facilities 
taking into account the recent million incremental term loan borrowings  our total contractual cash obligations increase by million annually in through and by million in effect of inflation and interest rate fluctuations historically  inflation has not had a material effect on us  other than to increase our cost of borrowing 
in general  we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials 
because we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates  our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million bore interest at floating rates  after taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
under these agreements  floating rate interest based on the three month libor rate was exchanged for fixed rates of interest ranging from percent to percent 
the aggregate notional principal amounts of these agreements totals million  with million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in and million aggregate notional principal amount maturing in depending upon market conditions  we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements with counterparties that  in our judgment  have sufficient creditworthiness to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility 
rationalization credits charges and acquisition reserves during  we approved and announced to employees separate plans to exit our northtown  missouri and kingsburg  california metal food container facilities and to cease operation of our composite container department at our waukegan  illinois metal food container facility 
these plans included the termination of approximately plant employees  the termination of an operating lease and other plant related exit costs  including equipment dismantle costs 
these decisions resulted in a rationalization charge of million 
this charge consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  million for employee severance and benefits and million for plant exit costs 
during  in order to support new business we decided to continue to operate our kingsburg facility and to continue to utilize certain northtown assets with carrying values that were previously written down as part of this rationalization charge 
as a result  we recorded rationalization credits totaling million  which consisted of million related to certain assets with carrying values that were previously written down but remained in service and million for the reversal of rationalization reserves related to employee severance and benefits and plant exit costs 
the assets that remained in service were recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at their depreciated cost  which approximated fair value 
through december   a total of million  excluding the non cash write down  had been expended related to the rationalization plans for our northtown and waukegan facilities  which consisted of million related to employee severance and benefits and million related to plant exit costs 
during  all actions related to these rationalization plans were completed at amounts less than originally estimated  and  accordingly  we reversed million of rationalization reserves as a rationalization credit 
in addition  during we placed an additional million of metal food container assets with carrying values that were previously written down back in service 
as a result  we recorded million as a rationalization credit and recorded those assets in our consolidated balance sheets at their depreciated cost  which approximated fair value 
during  we approved and announced to employees a plan to exit our fairfield  ohio plastic container facility 
the plan included the termination of approximately plant employees and other related plant exit costs  including equipment dismantle costs and contractual rent obligations 
this decision resulted in a rationalization charge of million  which consisted of million for employee severance and benefits and million for plant exit costs 
through december   a total of million has been expended relating to this plan 
these expenditures consisted of million related to employee severance and benefits and million for plant exit costs 
during  all actions under this plan related to employee severance and benefits were completed at amounts less than originally estimated  and  accordingly  we reversed million of rationalization reserves as a rationalization credit 
at december   this reserve had a balance of million 
although we have closed the plant  the timing of cash payments is dependent upon the expiration of a lease obligation 
accordingly  cash payments related to closing this facility are expected through during  we approved and announced to employees separate plans to exit our san leandro and city of industry  california metal food container facilities 
these plans included the termination of approximately plant employees  termination of two operating leases and other plant related exit costs including equipment dismantle costs and contractual rent obligations 
these decisions resulted in a rationalization charge of million 
this charge consisted of million for the non cash write down in carrying value of assets  million for employee severance and benefits and million for plant exit costs 
through december   a total of million  excluding the non cash write down  has been expended relating to these plans 
these expenditures consisted of million related to employee severance and benefits and million for plant exit costs 
all actions under these plans have been completed 
during  certain assets with carrying values that were previously written down as part of this rationalization charge were placed back in service 
as a result  we recorded a million rationalization credit and recorded those assets in our consolidated balance sheets at their depreciated cost  which approximated fair value 
the timing of cash payments under these plans was primarily dependent upon the resolution of various matters with the lessor of one of the facilities 
acquisition reserves established in connection with our purchase of the food metal and specialty business of american national can company  or an can  in aggregating approximately million were recorded pursuant to plans that we began to assess and formulate at the date of the acquisition and which were finalized in these reserves consisted of employee severance and benefits costs million for the termination of approximately plant  selling and administrative employees  plant exit costs million related to the planned closure of the st

at december   this reserve had a balance of million 
although we have completed our plan  cash payments are expected to continue for pension obligations totaling million which are required to be paid pursuant to a labor agreement in place at the time of acquisition and for the resolution of various environmental liabilities  estimated at million  that existed at the time of the acquisition

critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our accounting policies for deferred income taxes  pension expense and obligations and rationalization credits charges and acquisition reserves reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements 
you should also read our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets relating to million of net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  that expire between and  for which no valuation allowance has been established 
we had nols of approximately million available to offset future consolidated taxable income excluding cs can  and cs can had nols of approximately million available to offset its future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that these nols will be available to reduce future income tax liabilities based on estimated future taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences in future periods and the utilization of tax planning strategies 
current levels of consolidated pre tax earnings excluding cs can are sufficient to generate the taxable income required to realize our deferred tax assets 
pre tax earnings levels for cs can would need to increase from current levels to generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
we would reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it became more likely than not that a portion of these nols would not be utilized 
if a valuation allowance were established  additional expense would be recorded within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income in the period in which that determination was made 
this process requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  we reduced our discount rate from percent to percent to reflect market interest rate conditions 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected returns on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by approximately million 
for  and  we assumed that the expected return on our pension plan assets was percent 
historically  we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities 
acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the acquired entities  which includes eliminating operating redundancies  facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed 
we also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and  when deemed appropriate  we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities 
establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans  actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
revises the accounting treatment for business combinations to require the use of purchase accounting and prohibit the use of the pooling of interests method for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
revises the accounting for goodwill to eliminate amortization of goodwill on transactions consummated after june  and of all other goodwill as of january  as a result  we stopped recording goodwill amortization as of january  intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
also requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
during  we completed our review and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets and expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no

among other provisions  sfas no 
rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and sfas no 
 extinguishment of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements  such that most gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as extraordinary items 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to the rescission of sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for us on january  upon adoption in  we expect to reclassify previously reported extraordinary items from the loss on early extinguishment of debt to interest and other debt expense 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  certifications under section of the sarbanes oxley act of the written certifications of both of our co chief executive officers and of our chief financial officer with respect to this annual report on form k  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of usc section  have been submitted to the securities and exchange commission as additional correspondence accompanying this annual report

important factors that could cause the actual results of our operations or our financial condition to differ from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements include  but are not necessarily limited to o our ability to effect cost reduction initiatives and realize benefits from capital investments  o our ability to locate or acquire suitable acquisition candidates that generate attractive cash returns and on acceptable terms  o our ability to assimilate the operations of our acquired businesses into our existing operations  o our ability to generate free cash flow to invest in our business and service our indebtedness  o limitations and restrictions contained in our instruments and agreements governing our indebtedness  o our ability to retain sales with our major customers  o the size and quality of the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and west regions of the united states  o changes in the pricing and availability to us of raw materials or our ability generally to pass raw material price increases through to our customers  o changes in consumer preferences for different packaging products  o competitive pressures  including new product developments or changes in competitors pricing for products  o changes in governmental regulations or enforcement practices  o changes in general economic conditions  such as fluctuations in interest rates and changes in energy costs such as natural gas and electricity  o changes in labor relations and costs  and o other factors described elsewhere in this annual report or in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we also have limited foreign currency risk associated with our canadian and mexican operations and risk related to commodity price changes for items such as natural gas 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these risks 
interest rate  foreign currency and commodity pricing transactions are used only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our net income and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing cost 
to achieve our objectives  we regularly evaluate the amount of our variable rate debt as a percentage of our aggregate debt 
during and  our average outstanding variable rate debt  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements  was percent and percent of our total debt  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the issuance of million principal amount of the debentures in we manage a significant portion of our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in our variable rate debt through interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements effectively convert interest rate exposure from variable rates to fixed rates of interest 
we have entered into these agreements with banks under the new credit agreement or the us credit agreement  and our obligations under these agreements are guaranteed and secured on a pari passu basis with our obligations under the new credit agreement 
you should also read notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outline the principal and notional amounts  interest rates  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows from these agreements 
based on the average outstanding amount of our variable rate indebtedness in  a one percentage point change in the interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness would have impacted interest expense by an aggregate of approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements during foreign currency exchange rate risk we do not conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing or sales activity in foreign markets 
presently  our only foreign activities are conducted in canada and mexico 
since we do not have significant foreign operations  we do not believe it is necessary to enter into any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
because our canadian subsidiary operates within its local economic environment  we believe it is appropriate to finance such operation with local currency borrowings 
in determining the amount of such borrowings  we evaluate the operation s business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event that the canadian currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
furthermore  our canadian operating profit is used to repay its local borrowings or is reinvested in canada  and is not expected to be remitted to us or invested elsewhere 
as a result  it is not necessary for us to mitigate the economic effects of currency rate fluctuations on our canadian earnings 
commodity pricing risk we purchase commodities for our products such as metal and resins 
these commodities are generally purchased pursuant to contracts or at market prices established with the vendor 
in general  we do not engage in hedging activities for these commodities due to our ability to pass on price changes to our customers 
we also purchase other commodities  such as natural gas and electricity  and are subject to risks on the pricing of these commodities 
in general  we purchase these commodities pursuant to contracts or at market prices 
we manage up to a significant portion of our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations through natural gas swap agreements 
during  we entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december   we had entered into natural gas swap agreements to hedge approximately percent of our expected exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
these agreements effectively convert pricing exposure for natural gas from market pricing to a fixed price 
you should also read note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report which outlines the terms necessary to evaluate these transactions 
based on our natural gas usage in  a ten percent change in natural gas costs would have impacted our cost of goods sold by approximately million  after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our natural gas swap agreements
