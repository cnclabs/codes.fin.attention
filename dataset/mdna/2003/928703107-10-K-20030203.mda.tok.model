item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments  assumptions and valuations that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
future reported results of operations can be impacted if the company s estimates  judgments  assumptions or valuations made in earlier periods prove to be wrong 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant estimates  judgments  assumptions or valuations used in the preparation of the company s financial statements are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue primarily as services are rendered  products are shipped or directories are published 
within the company s operating segments  these services include the billing of labor  material and directory assistance transactions as they are provided 
in addition  the company may provide services under long term contracts 
revenue and costs applicable to long term contracts  including those providing for software customization or modification  are recognized on the completed contract method  upon the customers acceptance  in accordance with aicpa statement of positions no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts and no 
 software revenue recognition and related interpretations and amendments 
the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts when losses become evident 
accumulated unbilled costs on contracts are carried in inventory at the lower of actual cost or estimated realizable value 
the company  through its shaw shaw subsidiary  provides professional employer organizational services peo to certain customers which generally transfer its entire work force or employees of a specific departments or divisions to the company 
peo revenue represented less than of the company s consolidated sales in fiscal the company s peo services include payroll administration  human resource management  consulting on employee legal and regulatory compliance  providing comprehensive benefits  including retirement plans  workers compensation coverage  loss control and risk management and certain other services 
the customer has control over the day to day job duties of the employees 
peo revenue consists of the amounts charged to the customer by the company for the employee s gross pay  the employer s share of related payroll taxes  workers compensation and charges for certain other services provided by the company  and a negotiated percentage markup of the employees gross wages 
based on its analysis of emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company has concluded that it provides its peo services as a principal and  therefore  recognizes all amounts billed to its customers as gross revenues 
peo services revenue in fiscal   and aggregated approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the direct expenses borne by the company are included in cost of sales 
on january   the company received a comment from the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec questioning the company s revenue recognition policy for shaw shaw 
the company understands that its policy is in accordance with the prevailing practice in the peo industry and responded to the comment 
the staff of the sec advised the company that it believes the appropriate presentation should be to report the company s peo revenue net of gross payroll cost 
the company has not been able to resolve this comment to date 
if the company were required to record its peo revenue net of the gross payroll cost component of its services  there would be a reduction of sales and the related cost of sales  but no effect on the company s net income 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued under certain other contracts with customers  the company manages the customers alternative staffing requirements  including transactions between the customer and other staffing vendors associate vendors 
when payments to associate vendors are subject to receipt of the customers payment to the company and the company does not bear credit responsibility  the arrangements are considered non recourse against the company and the revenue  other than management fees payable to the company  is excluded from sales 
allowance for uncollectable accounts the establishment of an allowance requires the use of judgement and assumptions regarding potential losses on receivable balances 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history 
the company believes that these allowances are adequate  however  changes in the financial condition of customers could have an effect on the allowance balance required and a related charge or credit to earnings 
long lived assets as of the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these new rules  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual testing using fair value methodology 
the company engaged independent valuation firms  which primarily used comparable multiples of revenue and ebitda and other valuation methods to assist the company in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units measured 
an impairment charge of million was recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value as of the beginning of fiscal intangible assets with finite  measurable lives continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost  and depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line and accelerated methods at rates calculated to depreciate the cost of the assets over their estimated lives 
property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 these assets are tested for recoverability annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the fair values of the assets are based upon company estimates of the discounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets or the amount that would be realized from an immediate sale 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
although the company believes its estimates are appropriate  the fair value measurements of the company s long lived assets could be affected by using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
capitalized software the company s software technology personnel are involved in the development and acquisition of internal use software to be used in its enterprise resource planning system and software used in its operating segments  some of which are customer accessible 
the company accounts for the capitalization of software in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
subsequent to the preliminary project planning and approval stage  all appropriate costs are capitalized until the point at which the software is ready for its intended use 
subsequent to the software being used in operations  the capitalized costs are transferred from costs in process to completed property  plant and equipment  and are accounted for as such 
all post implementation costs  such as maintenance  training and minor upgrades that do not result in additional functionality  are expensed as incurred 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued securitization program the company accounts for the securitization of accounts receivables in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
at the time a participation interest in the receivables is sold  that interest is removed from the consolidated balance sheet 
on april   under a new securitization program  the company  through a special purpose subsidiary  sold a participation interest of million out of an initial pool of approximately million of receivables 
at november   the participation interest sold was million 
accordingly  the trade receivables included in the november  balance sheet have been reduced to reflect the million participation interest sold and no debt was recorded 
results of operations the information that appears below relates to prior periods 
the results of operations for those periods are not necessarily indicative of the results  which may be expected for any subsequent period 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the operating segment data in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear in item of this report 
fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks results of operations summary net sales decreased by million  or  to billion in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in sales in the staffing services segment and a million decrease in sales in the telecommunications services segment 
the company s operating segments reported an operating profit of million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
contributing to the fiscal decrease in operating profit were a decrease in operating results of million reported by the telecommunications services segment and a decrease of million in operating profit reported by the computer systems segment 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in operating profits of million reported by the telephone directory segment and million by the staffing services segment 
in fiscal  the company reported a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of million in fiscal non recurring items affecting results from continuing operations in fiscal included a gain of million on the sale of an investment in equity securities that had been written off in  partially offset by a write down of an investment in marketable securities of million and a gain on the sale of the company s interest in a real estate partnership of million 
in addition  results from continuing operations for fiscal included amortization of goodwill  which is no longer permitted to be amortized  of million 
in fiscal  the company reported a net loss of million compared with net income of million in the prior year 
results for fiscal included a non cash charge for the write down of goodwill of million reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting and a net gain from discontinued operations  after taxes  of million comprised of a million gain  including a tax benefit of million resulting from a taxable loss versus a gain for financial statement purposes  on the sale of the company s interest in autologic information international inc autologic partially offset by a loss from autologic s operations through the disposal date of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal 
in addition  fiscal results included a million  net of taxes  extraordinary charge for the early payment of the company s remaining million outstanding senior notes 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations by segment staffing services although sales of the staffing services segment decreased by million  or  to billion in fiscal  its operating profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal the technical placement division of the staffing services segment reported an operating profit of million on sales of million for fiscal  compared with an operating profit of million on sales of billion in the prior year 
low margin managed service sales comprised of the reported sales decline of the division 
the decline was due primarily to an increase in the number of associate vendors who agreed to be paid subject to the receipt of the customers payment to the company  resulting in the amounts  other than management fees to the company  associated with those revenues being excluded from sales  as non recourse managed service revenue 
a reduction in the use of managed service programs by several of the division s managed service clients also adversely affected sales 
although the division reported decreases in both traditional and managed service sales  an increase in high margin project management work contributed to an increase in gross margins of percentage points 
in addition  the division s continued overhead reductions and the absence in fiscal of goodwill amortization of million enabled the technical placement division to increase its operating profit and profit margin percentage 
the commercial and light industrial division of the staffing services segment reported an operating loss of million on net sales of million for fiscal compared with an operating loss of million on net sales of million in the prior period 
the decrease in operating loss was the result of lower overhead due to cost reduction efforts partially offset by an decline in revenue and a decrease in gross margins of percentage points due to increased competition  electronic auctions and customers leveraging their buying power by consolidating the number of vendors with whom they deal 
although sequential quarterly operating losses have declined during fiscal  cost control initiatives in the commercial and light industrial division have not fully offset lower revenue and gross margins 
while the staffing services segment is committed to continued cost controls designed to increase profitability for fiscal  a return to substantially higher profit levels is likely to depend on the timing and strength of a general economic recovery 
the company expects that high unemployment and the need for state and local governments to align their revenues with expenditures will result in pressures on margins as jurisdictions increase payroll and various other taxes 
although the markets for the segment s services include a broad range of industries throughout the united states and europe  general economic difficulties in specific geographic areas or industrial sectors have in the past  and could in the future  affect the profitability of the segment 
telephone directory while telephone directory segment s sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal  its operating profit increased by million  or  to million 
the reduction in sales was primarily due to lower printing and advertising revenue in uruguay due to the economic instability in neighboring item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations by segment continued countries  as well as in uruguay itself  along with decreased toll free directory advertising revenue in the united states 
despite the reduced sales  decreases in paper prices  production costs and overhead  along with increased productivity and the absence in fiscal of goodwill amortization of million  resulted in the higher profitability of the segment 
the segment currently has a high margin production contract with a telecommunications company  which accounted for of the segment s annual revenue in fiscal  that will terminate in june as the customer s operations are being sold 
the segment cannot determine the amount of revenue it will receive from the customer through the end of the contract or whether current revenue and profits will be replaced through existing or new customers in the future 
other than the datanational division  which accounted for of the segment s fiscal sales  the segment s business is obtained through submission of competitive proposals for contracts 
these short and long term contracts are re bid after expiration 
while the company has historically secured new contracts and believes it can secure renewals and or extensions of most of these contracts  some of which are material to this segment  and obtain new business  there can be no assurance that contracts will be renewed or extended  or that additional or replacement contracts will be awarded to the company on satisfactory terms 
in addition  this segment s sales and profitability are highly dependent on advertising revenue  which has been and continues to be affected by general economic conditions 
telecommunications services the telecommunications services segment s sales decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal and the segment sustained an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal despite a decrease in overhead of due to the emphasis on overhead reductions  the results of the segment continue to be affected by the decline in spending caused by the depressed conditions within the segment s telecommunications industry customer base 
this factor has also increased competition for available work  pressuring pricing and margins 
during fiscal  the company announced the reorganization of the segment s operations and continues its cost control initiatives in an effort to permit the segment to operate profitably at lower revenue levels without impairing its ability to take advantage of opportunities when the telecommunications industry stabilizes and customers spending increases 
a substantial portion of the business in this segment is obtained through the submission of competitive proposals for contracts  which typically expire within one to three years and are re bid 
while management believes it can secure renewals and or extensions of most of these contracts  some of which are material to this segment  and obtain new business  there can be no assurances that contracts will be renewed or extended or that additional or replacement contracts will be awarded to the company on satisfactory terms 
computer systems the computer systems segment s sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal while its operating profit decreased by million  or  to million 
the higher operating profit in fiscal resulted from the beneficial settlement with a vendor 
an increase in sales  in fiscal  was reported by all of the segment s divisions  including the segment s application service provider directory assistance and web based services provided by its voltdelta resources division  as well as it services provided by its item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations by segment continued maintech division 
this segment s results are highly dependent on the volume of directory assistance calls to the segment s customers that are routed to the segment under existing contracts  the segment s ability to continue to secure comprehensive listings from others  its ability to obtain additional customers for these services and its continued ability to sell products and services to new and existing customers 
results of operations other other items  discussed on a consolidated basis  affecting the results of operations were selling and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year as a result of decreased commissions and incentives due to the lower sales  the company s cost cutting initiatives and reduced financial reporting system expenses in fiscal selling and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of sales  were in fiscal and in fiscal depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal the decrease was attributable to a million reduction in goodwill amortization due to the effect of new rules on accounting for goodwill  which eliminated amortization of goodwill in favor of annual impairment tests which the company adopted at the beginning of fiscal see critical accounting policies  above 
this was partially offset by increased depreciation of fixed assets 
the company incurred other expense of million in fiscal  primarily in conjunction with the initial and subsequent transactions under the company s new securitization program and other sundry expenses 
in fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of securities that had been previously written off in  partially offset by a million write down of an investment in marketable securities  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million 
in fiscal  the company also recognized a pre tax gain of million on the sale of the company s interest in a real estate partnership 
the foreign exchange loss in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase was a result of unfavorable currency movements in the uruguayan and european currency markets 
to reduce the potential adverse impact from foreign currency changes on the company s foreign currency receivables and firm commitments  the company utilizes foreign currency option and forward contracts  when required  that generally settle on the last weekday of each quarter 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal the decrease was attributable to reduced working capital requirements resulting from the sales decline  as well as from the early repayment on march  of the remaining million of senior notes in contemplation of the lower cost accounts receivable securitization program 
the securitization program  costs of which are reflected in other expense see above  also eliminated higher cost borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
throughout fiscal  the company has also benefited from significantly lower market rates for financing  partially offset by an increase in rates in uruguay 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations other continued the company s effective tax rate was a benefit of of its financial reporting pre tax loss from continuing operations in fiscal compared to a tax provision in fiscal the low effective tax benefit in fiscal was primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit was provided 
the million gain  net of taxes  from discontinued operations arose from the company s sale on november  of autologic  the company s owned publicly held subsidiary  that comprised the company s electronic publication and typesetting segment  to agfa corporation through a tender offer for all of autologic s outstanding shares and a subsequent merger 
the company received million for its shares 
the net gain was comprised of a million gain on the sale  including a tax benefit of million resulting from a taxable loss versus a gain for financial statement purposes  partially offset by a loss from autologic s operations through the disposal date of million compared to a loss of million in fiscal 
on march   the company prepaid the remaining million of its senior notes in lieu of seeking amendments to the agreements under which the senior notes were issued that would have been required in order for the company to implement the securitization program discussed below under liquidity and capital resources and that may have been required  depending upon the size of the company s then expected first quarter loss 
the senior notes otherwise would have been due in installments over the two and one half years following the prepayment 
the make whole premium paid to the holders of the senior notes of million  or million net of taxes  was recognized as an extraordinary charge in the second quarter of fiscal for the early payment of that debt 
the million charge to earnings recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting arose from the required adoption  as of the beginning of fiscal  of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are subject to annual testing using fair value methodology 
the company engaged independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of the impairment that may have existed in the million of goodwill recorded as of the beginning of the fiscal year  november  the valuation firms primarily used comparable multiples of revenue and ebitda and other valuation methods to assist the company in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units measured 
the result of testing goodwill for impairment was a non cash charge of million 
the total remaining goodwill of the company at november  was million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks results of operations summary net sales decreased by million  or  to billion in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in sales by the staffing services segment of million and by the telecommunications services segment of million 
the company s income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal the operating profit of the company s segments decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal while operating profits of the staffing services and telecommunications services segments decreased  an increase in the computer systems segment s operating profit and a return to profitability by the telephone directory segment partially offset these decreases

the balance of the reduction was in the technical placement division 
the commercial and light industrial division of the staffing services segment was adversely affected by the nation s economic decline  with sales declining from fiscal the division sustained a loss of million on sales of million during fiscal versus an operating profit of million on sales of million in fiscal traditional temporary recruited revenue of the division  excluding lower margin managed service and professional employer organization services peo revenue  declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the division s results were also adversely affected by the added branch and infrastructure overhead that the division incurred  primarily in fiscal  based on the growth in traditional temporary recruited revenue that the division had experienced that year and in anticipation of continued growth 
the staffing services segment s technical placement division reported sales of billion in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal in fiscal  technical placement operating profit was million  compared with million in fiscal increased overhead associated with the opening of additional project management outsourcing facilities  branch and infrastructure expenses incurred in contemplation of a item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks continued results of operations segments continued continuation of fiscal s increased revenues  a sharp reduction in higher margin permanent placement fees  a reduction in higher margin sales to a major customer and costs associated with the development and implementation of new procurestaff services all negatively impacted operating results

of the million cash paid by volt funding to the company  million was used to repay the entire outstanding principal balance under the company s former revolving credit facility 
the participation interest sold remained at million until august   when it was increased to million 
the securitization program is not an off balance sheet arrangement as volt funding is a owned consolidated subsidiary of the company  with accounts receivable only reduced to reflect the fair value of receivables actually sold 
the company entered into this arrangement as it provided a low cost alternative to other forms of financing 
the securitization program is designed to enable receivables sold by the company to volt funding to constitute true sales of those receivables

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposure in the following areas interest rate market risk the company has cash and cash equivalents million at november  on which interest income is earned at variable rates 
the company also has credit lines with various domestic and foreign banks  which provide for borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million and a million accounts receivable securitization program 
at november   short term borrowings and accounts receivable financing under the securitization program amounted to million under these agreements  of which million was under the securitization program 
the interest rates on these borrowings and financing are variable and  therefore  interest and other expense and interest income are affected by the general level of us and foreign interest rates 
increases in interest and other expense resulting from an increase in interest rates could impact the company s results of operations 
the company policy is to take actions that would mitigate such risk when appropriate and available 
the company s long term debt of million at november  consisted of borrowings at fixed interest rates  and the company s interest expense related to these borrowings is not affected by changes in interest rates in the near term 
equity price risk the company holds short term investments in mutual funds for the company s deferred compensation plan 
at november   the total market value of these investments was million  all of which are being held for the benefit of participants in a non qualified deferred compensation plan with no risk to the company 
foreign exchange market risk the company has a number of overseas subsidiaries and is  therefore  subject to exposure from the risk of currency fluctuations as the value of foreign currencies fluctuate against the dollar  which may impact reported earnings 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by utilizing foreign currency option and exchange contracts  as well as borrowing in foreign currencies  to hedge the adverse impact on foreign currency net assets when the dollar strengthens against the related foreign currency 
at november   the company had entered into foreign currency option and forward contracts in the aggregate notional amount equivalent to million  which approximately offset its exposure in foreign currencies at that date 
as a result  the company believes that it has minimized its exposure to foreign exchange market risk
