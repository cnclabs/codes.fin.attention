item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview we are a leading domestic manufacturer and marketer of premium welded oil country tubular goods  which are steel tubular products used in the completion of and production from oil and natural gas wells 
we are also a major manufacturer of line pipe  which is used in the gathering and transmission of oil and natural gas 
in addition  we are a leading manufacturer of specialty tubing products used in industrial  automotive  construction  agricultural and power technology applications 
effective january   we acquired the assets of fintube technologies  inc fintube  a leading manufacturer in specialty tubing including heat recovery finned tubes  which are used in various applications including fuel economizers  petrochemical plants  refineries and combined cycle electrical power generation 
on april   we also completed an acquisition of the assets of bellville tube corporation bellville  a manufacturer of casing  tubing and line pipe for the oil and gas industry 
on october   we acquired the majority of the assets of wheeling machine products  inc and wheeling machine products of texas  inc 
collectively  wheeling  one of the largest domestic suppliers of couplings used to connect individual sections of oilfield casing and tubing 
manufacturing 
the manufacture of our products is capital intensive 
utilization rates at our manufacturing facilities in lone star  texas increased through the first half of following a brief increase in the drilling rig count around april and then reduced significantly during the second half of the year as demand for our oilfield products declined with the general decrease in drilling  which was down on average from the prior year with rig counts never rising above during the last thirteen weeks of the year 
specialty tubing demand fell with the overall general decline in the domestic economy 
shipments of flat rolled steel were up slightly but any gains in volume were offset by decreases in average price 
overall  total shipment volumes were down in over the prior year 
the reduced production volumes negatively impacted the cost of our products sold throughout the year as fixed and semi fixed costs were absorbed by fewer units produced 
the level of production volume through our various facilities has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing 
key variable costs include costs of labor and raw materials  including scrap steel  steel slabs  wire rod  steel coils  electricity and natural gas 
most of our finned tubes and other heat recovery products are manufactured in specific configurations as ordered 
accordingly  our manufacturing costs are to some extent factored into product prices on an order by order basis 
we have entered into marketing alliances and manufacturing arrangements with several companies 
these alliances and arrangements involve the marketing of their products which provide us access to additional manufacturing capacity 
in addition  we have manufacturing technology licensees in india  italy  japan and korea 
historically  our oilfield products have accounted for the majority of our total revenues 
for fiscal year  they were of total revenues 
as a result  our revenues are largely dependent upon the state of the oil and gas industry  which has historically been volatile 
a general downturn in the oil and gas markets that began in the second half of and geopolitical instabilities in various parts of the world caused demand for our principal products to decrease 
accordingly  our historical operating results have fluctuated based on the demand for our products 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  the level of oil and gas drilling activity and competition from imports 
our finned tubular products are affected by the level of domestic and foreign demand for power generation as well as domestic and foreign competition 
oilfield products 
our oilfield products consist of casing  which acts as a structural retainer wall in oil and natural gas wellbores  production tubing  which transmits hydrocarbons to the surface  line pipe  which is used in gathering and transmitting hydrocarbons  and couplings  which are used to connect individual sections of oilfield casing and tubing 
demand for our oilfield products depends primarily upon the number of oil and natural gas wells being drilled  completed and re worked and the depth and drilling conditions of these wells 
the level of these activities depends primarily on natural gas and oil prices and industry expectations as to future prices 
according to baker hughes rig counts  average domestic drilling activity decreased in to rigs  or by compared to the previous year 
further  distributors chose to fulfill a greater percentage of requirements out of existing inventories during the fourth quarter we expect demand for our oilfield products to increase throughout as the trend of higher oil and gas prices should result in an increase in the number of active drilling rigs and inventory levels at our distributors have been reduced 
the eia reports that the average west texas intermediate wti crude oil price increased by to per barrel from december to january the spot price of natural gas at the henry hub rose above per million btu late in january of spot prices have been consistently above per million btu as gas in underground storage has been significantly reduced compared to the levels of one year ago 
the eia further estimates that high natural gas prices and strong near term demand pressures will drive drilling activity and well completions to very robust levels in and we believe that these are positive indicators of increased demand for our oilfield products in specialty tubing products 
our specialty tubing product segment includes finned tubular products and precision mechanical tubulars 
our precision mechanical tubulars consist of a wide array of high quality  custom made steel tubular products with precise dimensional control and special metallurgical properties which are manufactured by the drawn over mandrel process 
this process allows us to achieve higher critical tolerances and dimensional control than other processes 
these products are used for several industrial applications  including the manufacture of hydraulic cylinders for construction and farm equipment  automotive applications  such as stabilizers and intrusion tubes  and other uses  including machine parts  bearing races  down hole pump barrels  heavy lift crane boom chords  drill rods and liner hangers 
demand for precision mechanical tubulars within the traditional markets was down in due to the economic slowdown  particularly in the industrial sector 
we believe that demand for our precision mechanical tubing products in will continue to be unfavorably impacted until the general economy recovers 
our finned tubular products are used in heat recovery applications such as fuel economizers  petrochemical plants  refineries and combined cycle electrical power generation plants 
demand for finned tubulars and related products was down throughout as a result of curtailed and cancelled power plant construction projects related to the general slowdown in the economy and lack of affordable capital for these projects 
with few exceptions  demand for new power plant construction projects is not likely to return in the near term until existing capacity is utilized 
however  the eia reports that the natural gas share of electricity generation is projected to increase from percent in to percent in finally  our finned tubular business has been reorganized around new marketing and commercial business lines directed at more traditional heat recovery markets including fuel economizers  where demand typically increases with higher natural gas and oil prices  and refineries  where demand typically should increase from facilities that will be retrofitted to comply with new federal regulations for lower sulphur content of gasoline and diesel fuel in and flat rolled steel and other products 
we manufacture and market flat rolled steel  which is primarily used in the manufacture of our oil country tubular products 
we also sell flat rolled steel to fabricators of large diameter transmission pipe  storage tanks  rail cars and a variety of other construction and industrial products 
our other products are principally used for structural and piling applications in the construction industry 
we sell flat rolled steel directly to end users and through service centers primarily in the southwestern region of the united states 
we sell flat rolled steel in highly competitive markets  with price  quality and availability primarily determining customer purchase decisions 
during the first half of  the united states government established antidumping duties and quotas for flat rolled steel suppliers from certain foreign countries which initially served to reduce the amount of imported foreign steel coils 
during  imports of low priced flat rolled steel increased throughout the year reducing our revenues from flat rolled steel by in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter of this surge of low priced imports was in part the cause for bankruptcies of several domestic steel mills 
in march  significant tariffs on imported products from all foreign countries other than canada and mexico were imposed  which will last for up to three years 
revenues from flat rolled steel and other tubular products were essentially flat in compared to although tons shipped increased  the volume increase was offset by lower average prices 
we sell thin strip steel directly to end users in north america through a small sales force 
flat rolled steel processing services are also sold to steel mills where we receive processing revenues but do not take title to the steel 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis  historical results of operations and financial condition are based on the related consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
lone star evaluates its estimates primarily based on historical experience and business knowledge 
these estimates are evaluated by management and revised as circumstances change 
a discussion of the significant estimates made by lone star follows warranty claims our products are used in applications which are subject to inherent risks including well failures  performance deficiencies  line pipe leaks  personal injury  property damage  environmental contamination or loss of production 
we warrant our products to meet certain specifications 
actual or claimed deficiencies in meeting these specifications may give rise to claims 
we maintain a reserve for asserted and unasserted warranty claims 
the warranty claim exposure is evaluated using historical claim trends and information available on specifically asserted claims 
we also maintain product and excess liability insurance subject to certain deductibles that limits our exposure to these claims 
we consider the extent of insurance coverage in our estimate of the reserve 
typically  this reserve is not subject to significant fluctuations from period to period 
however  the incurrence of an unusual amount of claims could alter our exposure and the related reserve 
bad debts our customers are concentrated in markets and industries that are subject to volatility 
in addition  we sell a substantial amount of products to a few customers 
we maintain a reserve for known and unknown bad debts 
we evaluate credit risk and the adequacy of our reserve by monitoring the age of our accounts receivable and the credit worthiness of our customers 
in addition  we monitor the overall status of the industries where our products and services are utilized 
typically  this reserve is not subject to significant fluctuations from period to period 
however  the incurrence of an unusual amount of bad debt could alter our exposure and the related reserve 
environmental obligations our business is subject to numerous environmental regulations 
we are actively remediating a few known exposures and conducting post closure monitoring activities 
our environmental department monitors the status of our environmental exposures and compliance with regulations through various means 
we maintain an environmental reserve to cover the costs of expected remediation and post closure monitoring 
we estimate the range of cost for the remediation and post closure based on historical experience  results of monitoring and the known extent of exposure 
we evaluate the range of exposure and record the reserve at the most probable amount within that range 
typically  this reserve is not subject to significant fluctuations from period to period  although given the nature of environmental exposure  significant changes in the reserve are possible 
revenue recognition product revenues are recognized as sales when revenue is earned and is realized or realizable 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through the receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  which may include delivery to the customer storage warehouse location at one of our subsidiaries in which instance  the risk of loss has been passed to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
freight and shipping that is billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
we have marketing agreements to sell steel oilfield tubular products manufactured by other companies 
revenue is recorded on a gross basis for certain transactions with alliance mills when we are the primary obligor and we have general inventory and credit risk  and certain other transactions are recorded net 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  goodwill  intangible assets and certain other assets  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
historical results of operations our revenues are derived from three business segments oilfield products  specialty tubing products and flat rolled steel and other products and services 
in the last three years  segment revenues were as follows in millions oilfield products specialty tubing products flat rolled steel and other products consolidated net revenues shipments of products by segment were as follows tons tons tons oilfield products    specialty tubing products    flat rolled steel and other products    total shipments    compared with net revenues of million for the year ended december  were down from oilfield products revenues decreased by million  or  to million  and shipment volumes were off by from the prior year 
demand for oilfield products is generally correlated to the number of rigs drilling 
there were average active rigs in compared to  in  a decrease of 
drilling activity decreased steadily through the first quarter of and although the average domestic rig count for the second quarter of was slightly lower than for the first quarter  it did increase by nearly rigs from the low of rigs at the beginning of april according to baker hughes 
however  after the rig increase  the average domestic rig count remained flat through the third quarter and ended the year at an average of active domestic rigs 
although average oilfield product prices were up slightly over  the increases were exclusive to the first three quarters of as average oilfield product prices declined from the third quarter to the fourth quarter due principally to a higher percentage of lower priced line pipe and carbon grade octg in the product mix 
specialty tubing product revenues decreased in to million  a decline from revenues of million due primarily to the general decline of economic conditions during revenues from heat recovery tubular goods and related products were down from to million as a result of delays and cancellations in power plant construction projects 
precision mechanical tubulars accounts for approximately of the total specialty tubing segment and shipments were up in to  tons  or over the prior year 
however  the volume increase was offset by a slight decline in average price resulting in a increase in precision mechanical tubular revenues 
flat rolled steel and other tubular products revenues were up to million 
this increase is attributable to continued improvements in the us steel markets as indicated by a increase in tons shipped over  offset by a decrease in average selling prices 
lower average prices were due to the sale of excess steel coils at fintube and a higher mix of lower priced products in this segment 
gross profit for was million compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to higher unit costs associated with decreased production volumes  increases in steel costs and reduced overall revenues from oilfield and specialty tubing products 
steel costs  which comprise approximately of our total cost of sales  were relatively stable during but increased nearly in the fourth quarter from the first half of these higher steel costs contributed to a significant reduction in gross margins and operating losses in the third and fourth quarters of as compared to selling  general  and administrative expenses increased significantly in by million  or to million compared to million in the increase is attributable to a million charge incurred as a result of a jury verdict against lone star on march  see item  legal proceedings 
the remaining difference relates to significant adjustments to our staffing including employment reductions of approximately before acquisitions  or approximately million  offset by increases in selling costs of approximately million  increase in healthcare costs of approximately million  increase in acquisition related costs of approximately million  and increase in professional fees of approximately million 
interest income decreased slightly in to million from million in due to lower average interest rates on invested cash 
interest expense consists of interest on the million  senior subordinated notes less amounts capitalized 
interest expense decreased slightly in to million from million in due principally to greater interest capitalization in versus income tax benefit 
lone star s effective tax rate is affected by the carryforward of net operating losses nol recognized or not recognized in a particular year and the full valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets 
in  the tax benefit at the us statutory rate of was reduced by million of nol benefit not recognized in the current period as management believes that it is more likely than not the related tax benefits would not be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future 
accordingly  due to the uncertainty regarding possible utilization of nols and the sensitivity of our earnings to the level of domestic drilling activity  we record a valuation allowance to fully reserve the computed net deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit for the year ended primarily consists of the recognition of state income tax benefits 
compared with net revenues of million for the year ended december  were higher than in revenues from oilfield products rose to million from on higher shipment volumes 
demand for oilfield products increased during the first half of due to a consistent increase in drilling activity  with the active rig count rising from  at the end of to  at the end of the second quarter of however  from the end of the second quarter of to the end of the year  the active rig count declined  significantly reducing demand for and revenues from our oilfield products in the second half of the year 
specialty tubing product revenues decreased in by from million in to million in revenues from precision mechanical tubing products were down due to reduced industrial activity associated with slower general economic conditions 
revenues from these products were particularly weak following events of september th as revenues dropped from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of likewise  revenues from specialty finned tubulars and related products fell in the fourth quarter of following the cancellation and curtailment of some power plant construction projects 
flat rolled steel and other tubular products were down from to million in  due to a decrease in shipment volumes and unchanged prices due to reduced industrial demand 
shipments decreased throughout the year as imports steadily increased 
gross profit for decreased to million 
gross profit was down although revenues were higher than due to significantly reduced production volumes in the second half of  which caused fixed and semi fixed cost to be absorbed in less units of production 
unit costs were particularly high in the fourth quarter as shipment volumes were down substantially in our three business segments due to the further slowdown in the economy after september th 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in this was due to increased expenses associated with high sales volumes in the first half of and severance costs related to workforce reductions associated with the business downturn in the second half of interest income increased in to million from million in due to higher cash balances resulting from million in proceeds from the sale of common stock in april of and million in proceeds from sale of bonds in may of  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense decreased from million in to in primarily due to lower interest rates 
other expense  net of million was primarily related to a one time charge of million for the write off of acquisition related expenses and financing costs associated with the uncompleted acquisition and million charge to income from the settlement of our interest rate swap upon early retirement of debt 
income before extraordinary items was million compared to million due to lower gross margins in the second half of resulting from significantly lower production volumes and the million write off of acquisition and financing costs associated with the uncompleted acquisition 
extraordinary loss of million for was due to early retirement of debt associated with the extinguishment of a bank credit facility using proceeds from the sale of stock and bonds 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash from operations in decreased principally due to the net loss of million  offset by reduced accounts receivable and investment in inventories  and lower payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
days sales outstanding was days at the end of  compared to days at the end of and days at the end of excluding our acquisition of wheeling  inventories were reduced in by million in response to the general decline in the domestic us economy including the associated decrease in demand for oilfield and heat recovery products 
cash from operations in increased due to higher sales 
cash used by operating activities in was attributable to increased accounts receivable and the increase in inventories associated with higher oilfield products shipments 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used in relates to our acquisition of wheeling and capital expenditures to improve the efficiencies and effectiveness of our production capabilities and to install new computer based enterprise resource planning systems 
cash used in primarily relates to higher capital expenditures to expand our finned tubular products capacity in mexico and canada and to install new computer based enterprise resource planning systems 
cash used in relates to our acquisitions of fintube and bellville and capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided in relates to proceeds from the offering of million shares of lone star common stock totaling million offset by million purchase of treasury shares 
cash provided by financing activities in was generated from the proceeds of the sale of million senior subordinated notes and million of common stock  offset by repayments on the revolving credit facilities and term loans 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to borrowings to finance the fintube and bellville acquisitions and higher borrowings to fund additional working capital to meet the increased demand for oilfield products 
on april   lone star sold million shares of common stock under a previously filed universal shelf registration statement 
proceeds to lone star were million 
lone star intends to use the remaining net proceeds from this sale to acquire other complementary businesses such as wheeling or to make compatible asset investments and provide funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
on october   lone star filed a universal shelf registration statement to sell from time to time up to a total of million of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  depository shares and warrants 
once this registration statement is effective  lone star will have an aggregate of approximately million of registered securities available  including a previously filed universal shelf registration statement 
also  on october   lone star s board of directors authorized the open market purchase of lone star s common stock from time to time for a total investment not to exceed million 
as of december   the company has  treasury shares at a cost of million 
on may   we issued million senior subordinated notes due june  to qualified institutional buyers 
interest on the outstanding senior subordinated notes accrues at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on each june and december  commencing december  we used the proceeds received from the senior notes to pay down the revolving lines of credit  term loans  slab consignment obligations and for general corporate purposes 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
on may   we sold million shares of our common stock under a previously filed universal shelf registration statement 
the proceeds to us were million 
proceeds of the sale were used to extinguish debt associated with credit facilities at our subsidiaries  lone star steel company steel and fintube technologies  inc fintube  and for general corporate purposes 
in october  lone star and its domestic subsidiaries entered into a three year million senior secured credit facility for use by lone star and our domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes 
under this credit facility  we can borrow an amount based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the availability under this facility was million at december  borrowings under this credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets  other than real estate 
at our option  the interest rate is the prime lending rate or the libor plus the applicable additional interest 
as a result  we will be subject to interest rate risk if we borrow under the credit facility 
at december   no amount was outstanding under this credit facility 
in september  the million credit facility was amended and restated which modified certain financial covenants 
for  we are in compliance with the facility s covenants and we do not anticipate non compliance in the foreseeable future 
in  fintube had a senior credit facility providing a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan used to pay part of the cash portion of the purchase price in the fintube acquisition 
in august  the fintube credit facility was paid in full early and terminated  resulting in the write off of million in deferred financing costs as an extraordinary item 
in addition  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement related to the fintube credit facility 
the settlement of the interest rate swap resulted in a million charge included in other expenses 
we operate in capital intensive businesses 
we have made  and we expect we will be required to make  significant capital expenditures each year for recurring maintenance necessary to keep manufacturing facilities operational  to comply with environmental and other legal requirements and to improve our information systems 
additionally  we regularly make capital expenditures for technological improvements and for research and development projects 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our capital expenditures budget for is approximately million to million 
we require capital primarily to fund general working capital needs and capital expenditures 
principal sources of funds include cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe these sources of funds will provide the liquidity necessary to fund our cash requirements during our operations are subject to environmental compliance and permitting requirements of various foreign  federal  state and provincial governmental agencies 
we believe that the cost of maintaining compliance with environmental requirements will fall within our contemplated operating and capital expenditure plans  averaging million to million annually in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations at december   we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt  to make payments under leases  purchase obligations and commercial commitments in the form of unused lines of credit 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows obligations due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than five years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations commercial commitment expirations are as follows commitment expiration by period total less than one year years years more than five years unused credit facility recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
this interpretation defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we have not completed our assessment as to whether or not the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
forward looking information the statements included in this annual report regarding future financial performance and results and the other statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
the words believes  intends  expects  anticipates  projects  estimates  predicts  and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including  but not limited to  industry and market conditions  environmental liabilities  competitive pricing  practices and conditions  availability and pricing of raw materials  fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas  the trade environment  the impact of current and future laws and governmental regulations particularly environmental laws and regulations and other factors discussed in this annual report and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain risks associated with the change in foreign currency rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we seek to minimize the potential adverse impact of those market risks through the use of appropriate management techniques including the limited use of derivative financial instruments 
our operations in mexico and canada are accounted for in the local currencies  converted to the us dollar equivalent based on published exchange rates for the period reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we believe that our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements is not significant 
our investments in cash equivalents  the weighted average maturity of which is less than one year  are subject to interest rate risk 
the value of these securities would decline in the event of increases in market interest rates 
we manage this risk by investing in securities with short term maturities and varying maturity dates 
in addition  we intend to hold these securities until maturity and  as a result  avoid the losses resulting from sudden changes in interest rates 
to the extent that we borrow against our credit facility  we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from the variable rate nature of the facility 
there were no borrowings on this facility at december  in the past  we have used interest rate swaps to effectively fix a portion of the interest rates on our variable rate credit facilities 
we did not have any interest rate swaps at december  our senior subordinated notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair value of the notes is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of lone star s senior subordinated debt based on quoted market prices was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we are subject to commodity price risk  primarily with respect to purchases of steel and natural gas 
purchased steel represents a significant portion of our cost of goods sold 
as a result  fluctuations in the cost of purchased steel  which can be volatile and cyclical in nature  have a significant impact on our margins both positively and negatively 
we purchase natural gas for our operations and therefore have a limited market risk in natural gas prices 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price of natural gas 
as market conditions dictate  we may enter into contracts to acquire a significant portion of our natural gas requirements over periods ranging from six to eighteen months 
our remaining requirements are purchased on the market at the current value
