item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance standard analog integrated circuits and high speed mixed signal and digital integrated circuits 
these circuits are used in a wide variety of electronics products  including those in the computer  telecommunications  industrial and networking markets 
in addition to standard products  the company manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services 
the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for   and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to original equipment manufacturers oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors  primarily located in north america and europe  significant return rights and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
micrel defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
sales to oem customers and stocking representatives  primarily located in asia  which have limited return rights and pricing adjustments  are recognized upon shipment and a related returns allowance is established based upon historical return rates 
the company s total allowance for returns was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
actual future returns could be different than the returns allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivables 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
the company s total allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company has taken adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
income taxes 
as of december   the company has net deferred tax assets of million  resulting from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities 
the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the company is currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to financial statements and has not accrued a liability for such litigation 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
an estimated liability would be accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the company were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonable estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation manufacturing facility impairment restructuring expense acquisition expenses total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in primarily due to lower custom and foundry revenues and  to a lesser extent  lower standard product revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decrease resulted primarily from decreased average selling prices across all product lines combined with decreased unit shipments of high bandwidth communications products  which were partially offset by increased unit shipments of analog power management products and ethernet communications products 
sales of standard products were led by low dropout regulators  ethernet communications products  computer peripheral products  switching regulators and high bandwidth communications products 
such products were sold to manufacturers in the telecommunications  computing  ethernet communications  high bandwidth communications  and industrial markets 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased unit shipments of foundry products 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
as a result of the slowing global economy  a rapid build up of semiconductor inventories in global sales channels occurred during  causing lead times for components to fall precipitously 
the short lead time environment has continued from the middle of through the end of customers perceive that semiconductor components are readily available and continue to order only for their short term needs 
new order rates have improved during as compared to  however there is not sufficient backlog for the company to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued predict future revenue levels with certainty 
the company s revenue levels are highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product can be delivered to the customer within the same period 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the period are called turns fill orders 
currently  the uncertainty of customer demand  the high turns fill requirement  and associated uncertainty of product mix and pricing  make it difficult to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
for the year ended december   net revenues decreased to million from million in due primarily to lower standard product revenues and lower custom and foundry revenues 
standard product revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decrease resulted from decreased unit shipments across all significant product lines and end markets except ethernet communications  combined with decreases in average selling prices 
sales of standard products were led by low dropout regulators  ethernet communications products  high bandwidth communications products and computer peripheral products 
such products were sold to manufacturers in the computing  ethernet communications  high bandwidth communications  telecommunications  and industrial markets 
custom and foundry revenues decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for such decreases were due primarily to decreased sales of custom high bandwidth communications products and to a lesser extent decreased foundry sales 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar increase in international sales resulted primarily from increased shipments of telecommunications  personal computer and ethernet communications products  primarily in asia 
the increased unit shipments to asian based customers is primarily a result of increased demand from manufacturers of wireless handsets and computers  as well as from customers transferring their manufacturing operations to asia seeking lower cost structures 
the company s international sales are denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price in local currencies of the company s products in foreign markets and make the company s products relatively more expensive than competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments with respect to such fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily reflected decreased average selling prices  a greater sales mix of lower margin products and decreased capacity utilization as compared to the same periods in the high level of semiconductor inventories relative to depressed demand resulted in extremely short lead times from semiconductor suppliers and vigorous price competition as customer unit demand increased in the first half of as a result of slack demand and customer inventory liquidation  the company s utilization of manufacturing capacity ranged from to during despite significant manufacturing cost reductions in  the under utilization of capacity led to a reduction in gross profit due to lower absorption of fixed costs 
consequently  depreciation as a percent of sales rose to in from in and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for the year ended december   the company s gross margin decreased to from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily reflected decreased capacity utilization  a reduced mix of higher margin standard products and custom products and a decrease in average selling prices compared to the same periods in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new processes and the definition  design and development of new products 
the company also expenses prototype wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized by the company and are demonstrated to support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the dollar increase was primarily due to increased prototype fabrication and new process development costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the years ended december  and  research and development expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the dollar increase was primarily due to increased engineering staffing costs and increased prototype fabrication costs and new process development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar decrease was principally attributable to decreased sales commissions and decreased staffing expenses  which were partially offset by increased legal costs 
for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net revenues  respectively 
on a dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the dollar decrease was principally attributable to decreased sales commissions and decreased profit sharing accruals 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the company s practices in effect through december related to employee stock option pricing resulted in stock compensation expense under apb for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million resulted from accelerated amortization of deferred stock compensation associated with options cancelled pursuant to an employee option exchange program see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the million in amortization of deferred stock compensation for the year ended december  consisted of million included in cost of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues and million included in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
as of december  total unamortized stock compensation was million with a future amortization schedule of million in  million in and  in for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million was included in cost of revenues  million was included in amortization of deferred stock compensation and million was included in non recurring acquisition costs 
for the year ended december  total amortization of deferred stock compensation was million of which million was included in cost of revenues and million was included in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
manufacturing facility impairment and restructuring expense 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  ca wafer fabrication facility to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
management believes that these actions are prudent given the current excess capacity levels within its wafer fabrication facilities combined with the uncertain demand in the high speed communications market 
as a result of this action  overall operating expenses are expected to decline by approximately  per quarter beginning in the fourth quarter of  with a total expense reduction of over million per quarter after the santa clara facility is exited in the fall of associated with the facility closure  the company accrued million in restructuring expenses  primarily for equipment disposal costs of million and contractual building lease costs  less estimated sublease income  of million that will provide no future benefit 
these restructuring costs are expected to be paid in cash over the remaining facility lease term  which expires in october of the million in accrued restructuring costs  million has been classified as other current liabilities and the remaining million has been classified as other long term obligations as of december  also related to the planned facility closure  the company concluded that the future undiscounted cash flows from this facility would not be sufficient to recover the net book value of the facility and accordingly recorded a million impairment of long lived assets to reduce the net book value of the facility s leasehold improvements and equipment to fair value 
the fair value was estimated by management based primarily on a third party estimate of the current net sales value of equipment totaling million at september  acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses for the year ended december  reflect million in direct transaction costs and million in stock compensation costs related to the acquisition of kendin 
other income  net 
other income  net reflects interest income from investments in short term investment grade securities and other non operating income  offset by interest expense incurred on term notes 
other income  net decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreased rates of return on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments combined with a non recurring expense in of  for the settlement of a patent dispute  partially offset by  in non recurring other income 
for the year ended december   other income  net increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the receipt of insurance proceeds of million in  combined with decreased interest expense due to a reduction in the average balances of term notes 
provision benefit for income taxes 
for the year ended december  the benefit for income taxes was million or of loss before taxes 
the benefit for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  state management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
for the years ended december  and the provision for taxes on income was of loss before taxes and of income before taxes  respectively 
the and income tax provisions differ from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate due to the effect of state taxes offset by the benefits federal and state research and development credits  and state manufacturing credits 
as of december   the company has net deferred tax assets of million  resulting from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities 
the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  the company s principal sources of funding have been its cash from operations  bank borrowings and sales of common stock 
principal sources of liquidity at december  consisted of cash and short term investments of million and a million revolving line of credit from a commercial bank 
there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit agreement at december  the revolving line of credit agreement expires on june  borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest rates of  at the company s election  the prime rate at december   or the bank s revolving offshore rate  which approximates libor at december  plus 
the agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include a restriction on the declaration and payment of dividends without the lender s consent 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in september  the company borrowed million through a commercial mortgage financing agreement which was associated with the purchase of its previously leased manufacturing facilities in san jose  ca 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest  at the company s election  at the daily floating prime rate at december   or adjustable monthly libor at december  plus 
the principal balance of the loan shall be paid in consecutive monthly installments of  and one final installment in the amount necessary to pay in full the remaining outstanding principal balance 
the mortgage agreement contains certain restrictive covenants 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  the company s working capital decreased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease primarily resulted from cash used to repurchase million of the company s common stock in as compared to million in the company generated million in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreased net income adjusted for non cash activities 
for the year ended december  the company s cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to net income after adding back non cash activities of million 
net income after adding back non cash activities consisted of a million net loss offset by non cash activities of million 
non cash activities for included additions of million for depreciation and amortization  million for stock compensation and million for manufacturing facility impairment which were partially offset by a increase in net deferred income tax assets 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s investing activities during the year ended december  used cash of million as compared to million of cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  this increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a reduction in net sales of short term investments 
cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from in net purchases of property  plant and equipment  which includes million for the purchase of the company s previously leased manufacturing facilities located in san jose  ca  combined with the purchase of million in intangible assets  which was partially offset by million in net sales of short term investments 
the company s financing activities during the year ended december  used cash of million as compared to cash provided of million during the year ended december  this decrease in cash flow primarily resulted from an increase of million in cash used to repurchase shares of the company s common stock combined with a decrease of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock which were partially offset by a million increase in long term borrowings 
cash used by financing activities during the year ended december  was the result of million to repurchase  shares of common stock and million in repayments of long term debt  which was partially offset by proceeds from long term debt borrowings of million related to the purchase of the company s previously leased manufacturing facilities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock through employee stock transactions of million 
the company currently intends to purchase approximately million to million in capital equipment and improvements during the next twelve months 
the majority of the anticipated capital spending is related to equipment and building improvements associated with the consolidation of wafer fabrication operations in its san jose facility 
the company also expects to purchase additional research and development related software and equipment  and manufacturing equipment for product testing of new products 
the company is currently authorized by its board of directors to repurchase an additional million of its common stock in the company expects that its cash requirements through will be met by its cash from operations  existing cash balances and short term investments  and its credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   the company had the following contractual obligations and commitments in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years long term debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements    operating leases see note of notes to consolidated financial statements      other long term liabilities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements    total      management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued factors that may affect operating results the statements contained in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding future products or product development  statements regarding future research and development spending and the company s product development strategy  statements regarding the levels of international sales  statements regarding future expansion or utilization of manufacturing capacity  statements regarding future expenditures  and statements regarding current or future acquisitions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date hereof  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that our actual results could differ materially from those in such forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in item business  item legal proceedings  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the additional factors set forth below 
the company is exposed to risks because of the uncertain rate of growth in the global economy 
although the global economy appears to have grown during after shrinking for a period in  recent events have cast doubt on the sustainability of future economic growth 
consumer confidence is waning due in part to the recent sharp decline in global equity markets 
reduced corporate profits and weak capital spending  especially for technology related end markets that the company serves such as the high speed communications  enterprise computing and telecommunications markets  continue to dampen demand for the company s products 
if economic conditions in the global economy worsen  or if a wider global economic recession materializes  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
the company s operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond the its control 
if the company s operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of its common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect the company s quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult for the company to control or predict are disruption of customer demand  transportation or supplier operations due to war or terrorism the volume and timing of orders received changes in the mix of products sold market acceptance of the company s products and its customers products competitive pricing pressures cyclical semiconductor industry conditions dependence on third party suppliers the ability to introduce new products on a timely basis the timing of new product announcements and introductions by the company or its competitors the timing and extent of research and development expenses fluctuations in manufacturing yields the ability to hire and retain key technical and management personnel access to advanced process technologies the timing and extent of process development costs management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer demand for the company s products is volatile and difficult to predict 
the company s customers continuously adjust their inventories in response to changes in end market demand for their products and the availability of semiconductor components 
this results in frequent changes in demand for the company s products 
the volatility of customer demand limits the company s ability to predict future levels of sales and profitability 
the supply of semiconductors can quickly and unexpectedly match or exceed demand because end customer demand can change very quickly 
also  semiconductor suppliers can rapidly increase production output 
this can lead to a sudden oversupply situation and a subsequent reduction in order rates and revenues as customers adjust their inventories to true demand rates 
a rapid and sudden decline in customer demand for the company s products can result in excess quantities of certain of the company s products relative to demand 
should this occur the company s operating results may be adversely affected as a result of charges to reduce the carrying value of the company s inventory to the estimated demand level or market price 
the weakness in the global economy in and has caused the end markets that the company s customers serve to grow less rapidly  or in some cases  contract 
the resulting uncertainty of demand has caused most of the company s customers to err on the side of caution until they see signs of order strength for their end products 
in addition  many customers are continuing to deplete inventories in response to short supplier lead times 
semiconductors are perceived to be readily available and supplier lead times are at or near historic lows 
in this environment customers are not making large purchase commitments  only ordering small quantities to fill known short term requirements  greatly reducing our visibility into customer demand 
as a result  the company s revenues are highly dependent upon turns fill orders orders booked and shipped in the same quarter 
the reduced level of order backlog coupled with the short term nature of customer demand makes it extremely difficult to predict near term revenues and profits 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  price erosion and increased international competition 
significant competitive factors include product features performance price timing of product introductions emergence of new computer and communications standards quality and customer support in times when economic growth and customer demand is less certain  such as the semiconductor industry is now experiencing  price competition becomes more prevalent 
both the semiconductor industry and the company have experienced significant price erosion since the beginning of if this price erosion continues it will have the effect of reducing revenue levels and gross margins in future periods 
because the standard products market for integrated circuits is diverse and highly fragmented  the company encounters different competitors in various market areas 
most of these competitors have substantially greater technical  financial and marketing resources and greater name recognition than the company has 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in either the standard management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued products or custom and foundry products business in the future or that competitive pressures will not adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the cost reduction actions the company has initiated may not materialize as expected  or be sustained as business improves 
the company has implemented or initiated a variety of cost reduction actions 
the expected future cost savings from these programs may not materialize as anticipated resulting in a smaller benefit to the company s financial results of operations 
furthermore  when customer demand improves and revenues increase  it is unclear whether micrel will continue to benefit from all of the cost reduction actions that have been implemented 
the consolidation of wafer fabrication operations into the company s san jose facility may negatively impact the results of operations or fail to result in expected cost savings 
in september  the company approved a plan to close its santa clara  ca wafer fabrication facility and transfer the production and research and development processes and certain equipment into its san jose  ca facility 
if the transfer of the equipment and manufacturing processes is not successful or is delayed  this could result in the company s inability to manufacture certain products and delay certain new product development 
in addition  expected cost savings related to this consolidation may be delayed or unachieved 
either of these factors could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
market conditions may lead the company to initiate additional cost reduction plans  which may negatively affect near term operating results 
as a result of weak customer demand  competitive pricing pressures  excess capacity  weak economic conditions or other factors  the company may decide to initiate actions to reduce the company s cost structure and improve the company s future operating results 
the cost reduction actions may require incremental costs to implement  which could negatively affect the company s operating results in periods when the incremental costs or liabilities are incurred 
the company s product offering  while diversified  is highly dependent on certain select end markets 
the company currently sells a significant portion of its products in the high speed communications  computer  networking and wireless handset markets 
these markets are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing customer demand  evolving and competing industry standards and seasonal demand trends 
additionally  there can be no assurance that these markets will continue to grow 
if the markets for high speed communications  computers  networking or wireless handsets that the company serves fail to grow  or grow more slowly than it currently anticipates  or if there is increased competition in these markets  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
an important part of the company s strategy is to continue to focus on the market for high speed communications integrated circuits 
if the severe downturn in the telecommunications infrastructure industry continues resulting in lack of demand for the company s high bandwidth products  the company s future revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s ethernet products have become an important portion of the company s revenues 
if the company fails to develop new products to serve this market in a timely manner  or if the market acceptance of the company s new ethernet products is poor  if a competitor s products unfavorably affect pricing or demand for the company s products  the company s revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company currently derives the majority of its product revenues from sales of standard analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and expects these products to continue to account for the majority of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for standard analog integrated and mixed signal circuits  such as competition  product performance or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the markets that the company serves frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if the company s products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  it would likely lose business from existing or potential customers and would not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins until the next product transition 
if the company fails to develop products with required features or performance standards  or experiences even a short delay in bringing a new product to market  or if its customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  its revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period of time 
the company encounters risks associated with its international operations  including geopolitical risks 
it is unclear what effect prolonged military conflict would have on world trade or on economic conditions in specific regions of the world 
reduced levels of economic activity  or disruptions of international transportation  could adversely affect the company s sales on either a global basis or in specific geographic regions 
two of the company s top ten direct customers are located in south korea 
in the event that current political tensions surrounding north korea evolve into military or social conflict  the company s revenues  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the company has generated a substantial portion of its net revenues from export sales 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its future net revenues will depend on export sales to customers in international markets  including asia 
international markets are subject to a variety of risks  including changes in policy by foreign governments  social conditions such as civil unrest  economic conditions including high levels of inflation  fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies and currency exchange rates and trade restrictions or prohibitions 
in addition  the company sells to domestic customers that do business worldwide and cannot predict how the businesses of these customers may be affected by economic or political conditions in asia or elsewhere in the world 
such factors could adversely affect the company s future revenues  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is reliant on certain key suppliers for wafer fabrication  circuit assembly and testing services 
most of these suppliers are based outside of the us the company s supply could be interrupted as a result of any of the previously mentioned risk factors relating to international markets 
the company s international sales are primarily denominated in us currency 
consequently  changes in exchange rates that strengthen the us dollar could increase the price of the company s products in the local currencies of the foreign markets it serves 
this would result in making the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued company s products relatively more expensive than its competitors products that are denominated in local currencies  leading to a reduction in sales or profitability in those foreign markets 
the company has not taken any protective measures against exchange rate fluctuations  such as purchasing hedging instruments 
the company s gross margin is dependent upon a number of factors  including the level of capacity utilization 
semiconductor manufacturing is a capital intensive business resulting in high fixed costs 
if the company is unable to utilize its installed wafer fabrication or test capacity at a high level  the costs associated with these facilities and equipment would not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower sales margins 
the decline in new customer order rates has resulted in reduced capacity utilization of the company s factories as it has attempted to match production with anticipated customer demand 
the company s gross margins have declined as a result of this reduced utilization of production capacity 
gross margins may deteriorate further should production activity be curtailed in response to lower customer demand in the future 
dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that the company will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that its cost of materials will be higher than expected 
the company faces many risks associated with its dependence upon third parties that manufacture  assemble or package certain of our products 
these risks include reduced control over delivery schedules and quality risks of inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to the company potential increases in prices potential misappropriation of the company s intellectual property any of these risks may lead to increased costs or delay delivery of the company s products  which would harm its profitability and customer relationships 
additionally  the company s wafer and product requirements typically represent a relatively small portion of the total production of the third party foundries and outside assembly  testing and packaging contractors 
as a result  micrel is subject to the risk that a foundry will provide delivery or capacity priority to other larger customers at the expense of micrel  resulting in an inadequate supply to meet customer demand or higher costs to obtain the necessary product supply 
also  there is a risk that a third party manufacturer will cease production on an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce the company s products 
the company cannot be certain that its outside manufacturers will continue to devote resources to the production of its products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of its products are based 
each of these events could increase the company s costs and harm its ability to deliver our products on time 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory action in connection with the restatement of its financial statements  and the potential liability from any such litigation or regulatory action could harm its business 
on january   the company announced that it would restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december    and  and the fiscal quarters ended march   june   and september  as a result of this restatement  the company could become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings  or both

there can be no assurance that existing claims or any other assertions or claims for indemnity resulting from infringement claims will not adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company s operating results substantially depend on manufacturing output and yields  which may not meet expectations 
the company manufactures most of its semiconductors at its san jose and santa clara  california fabrication facilities 
manufacturing semiconductors requires manufacturing tools that are unique to each product being produced 
if one of these unique manufacturing tools was damaged or destroyed  then the company s ability to manufacture the related product would be impaired and its business would suffer until the tool was repaired or replaced 
additionally  the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
small impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the company faces risks associated with acquisitions it has completed and will face risks associated with any future acquisitions 
the company has made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future 
the risks involved with acquisitions include diversion of management s attention failure to retain key personnel amortization of acquired intangible assets customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the acquired company the cost associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired operations assumption of unknown liabilities any of these risks could materially harm the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  any acquisition involves a significant amount of integration of two companies that have previously operated independently 
no assurance can be given that difficulties will not be encountered in integrating certain products  technologies or operations of the acquired companies or that the benefits expected from such integration will be realized 
there can be no assurance that any of the acquired companies will retain its key personnel  that the engineering teams of micrel and the acquired companies will successfully cooperate and realize any technological benefits or that micrel or the acquired companies will realize any of the other anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
in addition  the consummation of an acquisition could result in the cancellation  termination or non renewal of arrangements with the acquired company by suppliers  distributors or customers  or the termination of negotiations or delays in ordering by prospective customers as a result of uncertainties that may be perceived as a result of the acquisition 
any significant amount of cancellations  terminations  delays or non renewals of arrangements with the acquired company or loss of key employees or termination of negotiations or delays in ordering could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results or financial condition of the acquired company and micrel after the acquisition 
in addition  some of the past acquisitions have been accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting which means the acquisitions are subject to rules established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
these rules are complex and the interpretation of them is subject to change 
additionally  the availability of pooling of interests accounting treatment for a business combination depends in part upon circumstances and events occurring after the acquisition 
the failure of a past business combination that has been accounted for under the pooling of interests accounting method to qualify for this accounting treatment would materially harm the company s reported and future earnings and likely  the price of its common stock 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company s future success depends in part on the continued service of its key design engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel and its ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design engineers  and the company may not be able to continue to attract and train engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of its business or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave its employ in the future 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to the company s product and process development programs 
our ability to manufacture sufficient wafers to meet demand could be severely hampered by natural disasters 
our existing wafer fabrication facilities are located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes 
a significant natural disaster  such as an earthquake or prolonged drought  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s business could be adversely affected by electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
the majority of the company s administrative  technical and manufacturing facilities are located in northern california and these facilities may be subject to electrical power or natural gas supply interruptions 
in recent months  electrical power suppliers have experienced shortages in electrical power which has resulted in brief electrical power interruptions 
the weak financial condition of california s public utilities may aggravate the situation and shortages may develop for natural gas 
semiconductor manufacturing depends upon a controlled environment that requires high usage of electrical power and natural gas 
frequent or extended electrical power interruptions could have a negative impact on production output  manufacturing yields  and manufacturing efficiencies and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or a cessation of operations 
in addition  these regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities at their present locations or construct or operate a new wafer fabrication facility or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
our failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business
