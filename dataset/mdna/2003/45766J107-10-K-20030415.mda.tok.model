overview we commenced operations in  and currently develop  market and support software technologies that implement accelerated virtual machine technology for memory constrained smart devices 
in january  we announced our intention to launch a new product line called the jeode platform  based on our embedded virtual machine evm technology 
we also explored new markets that would leverage our years of emulation software development experience 
the jeode platform is our implementation of sun microsystems  inc s sun java technology tailored for smart devices 
it leverages patent pending intellectual property to provide these resource constrained devices with high performance  fully compatible java applet and application support 
the product became available for sale in march the jeode platform has been our principal product line since the third quarter of insignia expects that it will continue to rely upon sales of jeode products  plus new products that may be introduced  for our revenue in the foreseeable future 
the jeode product line revenue model is based on original equipment manufacturer s oems and channel partners customer transactions 
during  we began development of a range of products secure system provisioning or ssp products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless carriers to build valuable incremental services 
the ssp product became available for lab and market trials in early and will be available for shipment to customers in the second half of we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
additionally  the sales cycle for the ssp products is expected to take longer than the typical six to nine months to complete as seen with the jeode product 
before  our principal product line was softwindows 
this product enabled microsoft windows windows applications to be run on most apple computer inc apple macintosh computers and many unix workstations 
revenues from this product line grew until  but declined significantly thereafter 
our operations outside of the united states are primarily in the united kingdom  where the majority of our research and development operations and our european sales activities are located 
we distribute our jeode platform through oem s 
our revenues from customers outside the united states are derived primarily from europe and asia and are generally affected by the same factors as our revenues from customers in the united states 
the operating expenses of our operations outside the united states are mostly incurred in europe and relate to our research and development and european sales activities 
such expenses consist primarily of ongoing fixed costs and consequently do not fluctuate in direct proportion to revenues 
our revenues and expenses outside the united states can fluctuate from period to period based on movements in currency exchange rates 
historically  movements in currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our revenues 
we operate with the us dollar as our functional currency  with a majority of revenues and operating expenses denominated in us dollars 
pound sterling exchange rate fluctuations against the dollar can cause uk expenses  which are translated into dollars for financial statement reporting purposes  to vary from period to period 
sale of java virtual machine assets on february   we entered into a million loan agreement with esmertec ag esmertec 
the loan was made in two installments of  each on february  and february  the rate of interest on each loan is at prime plus two percent 
accrued interest is due on the last day of each month 
the principal and any outstanding accrued interest is due on or before february  on march   we entered into several other agreements the agreements with esmertec including a definitive agreement to sell certain assets relating to our java virtual machine jvm line of business in exchange for million payable in installments 
payments under the agreement would be  on april    on july    on october    on january  and  on april  the assets primarily included the fixed assets  customer agreements and employees related to this operation 
the transaction is expected to close in april under the terms of the agreements  esmertec will also become the exclusive master distributor of the jvm technology in exchange for million in minimum guaranteed royalties through june  at which time  the jvm technology rights will transfer to esmertec 
minimum payments under the license are as follows due date payment april   may   july   july   august   october   october   november   january   january   february   april   may   july   august   october   total  in addition  we can earn up to an additional million over the next three years based on a percentage of esmertec s future sales of the jvm product 
additionally  the parties have entered into a cooperative agreement to promote insignia s ssp software product to esmertec s mobile platform customers 
the agreement provides for esmertec to manage the existing insignia jvm customer relationships and license the insignia and esmertec technologies to sell to the then combined customer base and business partners 
esmertec will assume the entire jvm business through a final asset purchase in june as part of the sale of our jvm business  we expect to transfer employees to esmertec  of which were development engineers 
in addition  as part of the sale  esmertec is to enter into an agreement with our uk building landlord to take over the leasehold property on one of the two buildings leased by insignia 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of prepaid royalties  and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts 
actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after the normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue on the earlier of due date or cash collected 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we will defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for all sales  we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order primarily for maintenance renewals as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we will allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we will defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligation is based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we will generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we will assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and will adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of accounts receivables and future operating results 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
prepaid royalties our agreements with licensors sometimes require us to make advance royalty payments and pay royalties based on product sales 
prepaid royalties are capitalized and amortized as cost of sales based on the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales 
we continually evaluate recoverability of prepaid royalties and  if necessary  will charge to cost of sales any amount that we deem unlikely to be recoverable in the future 
the prepaid royalties carried on the balance sheet  under the terms of the distribution agreement between sun and insignia  require us to use these prepaid licenses before june  we have performed an assessment of whether there was an indication that prepaid royalties of million are impaired as of december  our estimation of utilization  based on past revenue history and future revenue estimates using current average per unit selling price ranges  indicates that there could be unused prepaid royalties at the expiration of the distribution agreement 
assuming the completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  esmertec has entered into a master distributor license agreement with insignia  whereby esmertec will license product from insignia which will consume all the prepaids paid to sun 
however  if the esmertec agreement is not completed  we believe that should unused prepaid royalties become predictable in the future  we could reduce the selling price in order to utilize the remaining prepaid balance 
this price reduction would result in lower gross margins 
we will continue to assess this potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
the deterioration of the business climate and lower than expected product sales could potentially impact this assessment and require an impairment charge in a future quarter 
prepaid royalties are classified as current assets based on estimated net product sales within the next year 
revenues year ended december  in thousands license revenues    service revenues    total revenues    the jeode product line was our primary business for  and revenue from the jeode product line is derived from four main sources the sale of a development license  the sale of annual maintenance and support contract services  prepaid royalties and commercial use royalties based on shipments of products that include jeode technology  and non recurring engineering activities 
revenues from the sale of development licenses  packaged products and royalties received from oems are classified as license revenue  while revenues from non recurring engineering activities  training  and annual maintenance contracts are classified as service revenue 
in  and  jeode platform revenues accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
the jeode platform became available for sale in the jeode platform is our principal product 
the jeode platform revenue decreased in compared to due to increased competition as well as the general weakening of the economy 
the jeode platform revenue decreased in compared to  due to the decline in the internet appliance market  a key market target for as well as the general weakening of the economy  principally in the second half of the jeode platform revenue increased in compared to as a result of increased demand 
in and license revenue from the sale of jeode accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues 
service revenue from the jeode platform accounted for and of total revenues for and  respectively 
assuming the completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  we expect minimal revenue from the jvm license and service revenue 
we expect to generate revenue from the ssp product in the second half of license revenues decreased in compared to due to the decline in the internet appliance market and the general weakening of the economy 
there were fewer prepaid royalties in and compared to service revenues decreased in compared to and increased in compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased jeode engineeing and jeode support contracts 
in  and  total revenues from softwindows accounted for  and  respectively  of total insignia revenues primarily due to reduced demand for softwindows and management s decision to discontinue the product line in no future revenues are expected from softwindows 
sales to distributors and oem s representing more than of total revenue in each period accounted for the following percentages of total revenue year ended december  distributors phoenix technologies ltd 
victor data systems company  ltd 
wind river systems  inc all distributors oem s quantum corporation gemstar international group  ltd 
all oems less than sales to customers outside the united states  derived mainly from customers in europe and asia  represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
we currently market jeode to customers in the united states  europe and japan 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on total revenues in  or economic conditions in europe and japan  as well as fluctuations in the value of the euro and japanese yen against the us dollar and british pound sterling  could impair our revenue and results of operation 
international operations are subject to a number of other special risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended december  in thousands  except percentages cost of license revenues    gross margin license revenues cost of service revenues gross margin service revenues total cost of revenues    gross margin total revenues cost of license revenue is mainly comprised of royalties to third parties 
cost of service revenue includes costs associated with non recurring engineering activities and end user support under maintenance contracts 
we believe that the significant factors affecting the jeode platform gross margin include pricing of the technology license  pricing of the unit usage and royalties to third parties such as sun microsystems  inc sun 
in early  we signed a five year agreement with sun under which sun established us as an authorized virtual machine provider 
under this agreement we are required to pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode platform enabled smart device shipped by our customers  plus a royalty on all development licenses put in place between our customers and us 
in the third quarter of  we amended our license agreement with sun 
the amendment expanded the scope of the licensed technology  changed the royalty rate  limited the royalty obligations to only per units licensed  established required prepaid royalties and extended the expiration date of the contract from march to june license revenue gross margins in were compared to in the increase was due to the prior year revenue including a large deal with lower gross margin and the current year including greater license revenue with minimal cost of sales 
license gross margins in decreased to from in due to the prior year including substantial license revenue from one customer at gross margin 
gross margin for service revenue is impacted by the level of and pricing terms of non recurring engineering activities  which can vary from customer to customer  from contract to contract and based on the level of maintenance contracts sold 
gross margin for service revenue in was compared to in the decrease was due to fewer maintenance contracts 
gross margin for service revenue in was comparable to at and  respectively 
operating expenses year ended december  in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues general and administrative    percentage of total revenues restructuring percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs  salesperson commissions  advertising and promotional expenses and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by in over primarily due to decreased personnel costs  decreased recruiting costs and decreased employee travel 
personnel costs decreased due to a decrease in headcount throughout most of the year 
decreased headcount resulted in a decrease in related travel expenditures and a decrease in recruiting fees over the prior year 
legal fees relating to patent and trademarks decreased approximately over the prior year 
sales and marketing expenses increased by in from sales and marketing expenses increased in the first half of and were reduced the second half of the year due to changes in staffing 
we anticipate a moderate decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the next year as we continue to control expenses in our marketing and sales organization for our jeode product line and other product lines  however  assuming the completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease over 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  overhead costs relating to occupancy and equipment depreciation 
research and development expenses in decreased over approximately  of the decrease was due to reductions in personnel related expenses 
there was a slight increase of  relating to an increased reliance on outside consultants 
in addition there was an increase of  for support and maintenance expenditures relating to a software vendor 
research and development expenses in increased over research and development expenses are expected to decrease moderately in the near term 
assuming the completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease approxmately 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established  after which any additional costs are capitalized 
in  and  no development expenditures were capitalized  as there were no amounts that qualified for capitalization 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for finance  information systems  human resources and general management 
general and administrative expenses decreased by in from the decrease was primarily due to  in salary costs and a  decrease in personnel related costs  which consist primarily of recruiting and personnel related expenses 
professional service expenditures decreased by  rent costs decreased by  and bad debt expense decreased by  the decreases were offset in part due to increased insurance costs of  general and administrative expenses increased by in over as a result of former cfo severance costs  new cfo recruiting costs and an additional  increase in the reserve for bad debt expense 
expenses are expected to decrease moderately in the near term 
assuming the completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease moderately 
restructuring in the third quarter of  we completed a worldwide reduction of headcount of approximately of our staff 
restructuring expenses consist of severance payments made during the third and fourth quarters of in october  we reduced headcount by persons 
restructuring expenses which represented and of total revenues in and  respectively  consisted of costs related to terminated employees  including severance payments as well as national insurance costs where legally required 
on february   we announced a restructuring of the organization to focus on the ssp technology 
as part of the restructuring  richard noling resigned as chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer 
mark mcmillan  president and chief operating officer  was promoted to chief executive officer and linda potts  controller  was promoted to chief financial officer 
interest income expense  net year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest income expense  net percentage of total revenues net interest income decreased from income of  in to income of  in this decrease was primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower cash and cash equivalent balances 
our cash  cash equivalents and amounts held in escrow decreased from million at december  to million at december  net interest income increased in to income of  from expense of  in due to larger cash and cash equivalent balances and no debt in net interest income is expected to decrease in other income expense  net year ended december  in thousands  except percentages other income expense  net percentage of total revenues net other income decreased from income of  in to expense of  in the decrease was due mainly to an expense of  relating to the black scholes valuation of million warrants issued to fusion capital see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income of  was due to a combination of foreign exchange gains and losses 
net other income decreased from income of  in to income of  in the decrease was due to a combination of foreign exchange gains and losses 
net other income is expected to increase in approximately of our total revenues and over of our operating expenses are denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
most of our remaining revenues and expenses are british pound sterling denominated and consequently we are exposed to fluctuations in british pound sterling exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material effect on our results of operations in the future 
we did not enter into any currency option hedge contracts in  or we have  at times  an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended december  in thousands  except percentages provision benefit for income taxes  effective income tax rate our benefit for income taxes for primarily represented refunds received from the united kingdom for research and development claims 
the benefit for income taxes for primarily represented the release of a provision for prior year taxes that is no longer required following an agreement in principle with the united kingdom tax authorities which is offset by japanese income tax withholding 
the benefit for income taxes for primarily represented a tax refund from the united kingdom government on taxes paid in the years a more complete analysis of the differences between the federal statutory rate and the effective income tax rates is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets  primarily comprised of net operating losses  on the basis that significant uncertainty exists with respect to their realization 
effective and retroactive to  research and development expenditures incurred in the united kingdom qualified for a tax credit 
the tax credit does not offset tax liability but rather is a refund 
the estimated refund for is  and is recorded as a receivable on the balance sheet 
the actual refund for and was  and  respectively 
the cumulative total for the three years ended was million and was recorded on the income statement as a benefit for income taxes 
a provision of  was recorded in which comprised  for japanese tax withholding for payments made to the us subsidiary   for local japanese tax   for franchise state tax and  for french local tax 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash  working capital    net cash used in operating activities    we have transitioned our product focus from compatibility products to our jeode product line based on our virtual machine technology 
this change in product focus has resulted in a redirection of available resources from our historical revenue base towards the development and marketing efforts associated with the jeode platform  which was released for general availability in march cash used in operating activities totaled million during  compared to million during  and million in in fiscal  cash used in operations resulted primarily from a net loss of million  an increase of tax receivable of  an increase of prepaid royalties of million and a reduction of deferred revenue of million 
offsetting these were a decrease of accounts receivable of million 
the increase in resulted primarily from a net loss of million  an increase of accounts receivable of million and an increase of prepaid royalties of million 
offsetting these were an increase of deferred revenue of million 
cash used in investing activities in was  which consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of million being released from escrow  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of  this compares to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal cash provided by financing activities in was  which consisted primarily of proceeds from exercise of warrants of  and from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans of  cash provided by financing activities in was million  which consisted primarily of proceeds from a private placement of million  proceeds from exercise of warrants of  and issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans of  this compares to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments held in escrow  were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december  the principal source of working capital came from accounts receivable collections and warrant and option exercises 
during the twelve months ended december   our net accounts receivable decreased million from million at december  to  at december  due to firm collection efforts 
capital additions totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures or strategic investment 
we expect that the decrease in accounts receivable  decreased revenues in the quarter ended december  and other factors will substantially decrease our future cash flows for the next several quarter 
as of december   four customers accounted for of the gross accounts receivable balance 
a large portion of the accounts receivable balance for the quarter ended december  is related to one customer  phoenix  and accounted for of the outstanding balance 
on october   we signed a convertible promissory note in favor of quantum corporation quantum for million 
the note is convertible at quantum s option to insignia s shares any time during the lifetime of the note 
all unpaid principal and unpaid interest  accrued at per annum  compounded quarterly  was converted to ordinary shares on december  on march   we entered into a binding agreement with a director and members of his family whereby they would provide the company a million line of credit 
the interest rate on amounts drawn down is at prime plus until june  and thereafter at prime plus per annum simple interest  payable in cash at the repayment date 
we drew down a total of million on the line of credit during on november   we repaid this sum along with all accrued interest and the termination fee due 
we have entered into three employment agreements with key executives which would require us to continue to pay salary for up to one year if any of these employees are terminated under certain circumstances as specified in the agreements 
in september  insignia and sun microsystems  inc sun entered into amendment no 
the amendment to the technology license and distribution agreement the distribution agreement between the two companies 
in addition  in june  the two companies entered into an addendum the addendum to the distribution agreement relating to distribution of products to an insignia customer 
the amendment and the addendum each required us to make non refundable royalty prepayments to sun 
a total of  of prepaid royalties were paid to sun under distribution agreements through the second quarter of there are no additional required royalty prepayments due to sun under these distribution agreements 
the prepaid royalties carried on the balance sheet  under the terms of the agreement between sun and insignia  require us to use these prepaid licenses before june  we continually evaluate the recoverability of these prepaid royalties and  if necessary  will charge to cost of sales any amount that we deem unlikely to be recoverable in the future 
we have performed an assessment of whether there was an indication that the prepaid royalties of million are impaired as of december  our estimation of utilization  based on past revenue history and future revenue estimates using current average per unit selling price ranges  indicates that there could be unused prepaid royalties at the expiration of the license and distribution agreement 
however  we believe that should unused prepaid royalties become predictable in the future  we could reduce the selling price in order to utilize the remaining prepaid balance 
this price reduction would result in lower gross margins 
we will continue to assess this potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
the deterioration of the business climate and lower than expected product sales could potentially impact this assessment and require an impairment charge in a future quarter 
during  we sublet until march facilities we previously occupied in the united kingdom  on substantially the same terms as those applicable to us 
in january  we entered into an agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease on april  on march   our us subsidiary  insignia solutions  inc insignia us entered into an accounts receivable financing agreement with silicon valley bank 
the financing agreement allows insignia us to borrow an amount up to of eligible receivables not to exceed  with interest at the bank s prime rate plus two percentage points 
the agreement was canceled on february   and the ucc filing liens on the assets of insignia us were terminated 
no funds were ever borrowed under this credit facility 
we have granted extended payment terms from time to time and  depending on various factors  including the length of the extended payment period and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we report these future payments as accounts receivable and either recognized revenue or deferred revenue 
deferred revenue decreased  for the three months ended december  and decreased by  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease primarily reflects the recognition of revenue from the phoenix technologies agreement 
insignia  as permitted under delaware law and in accordance with our bylaws  indemnifies our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while the officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we do have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
in our sales agreements  we typically agree to indemnify our customers for any expenses or liability resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
the terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
to date we have not paid any amounts to settle claims or defend lawsuits 
insignia  on a limited basis  has granted price protection 
the terms of these agreements are generally perpetual 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these potential future payments either because they are not probable or we have yet to incur the expense 
insignia warrants its software products against defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of ninety days 
there is no warranty accrual recorded because potential future payments either are not probable or we have yet to incur the expense 
on october   we entered into a securities subscription agreement agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital  pursuant to which fusion capital agreed to purchase  on each trading day following the effectiveness of a registration statement covering the american depository shares adss to be purchased by fusion capital   of our adss up to an aggregate of million over a period of months 
the purchase price of the adss will be equal to a price based upon the future market price of the shares without any fixed discount to the market price 
in order to be in compliance with nasdaq rules  we could not sell our ordinary shares to fusion capital at a price below  which represents the greater of the book value per share of our ordinary shares as of september  or the closing sale price per share of our adss on october  if we elect to sell our shares to fusion capital at a price per share below  we first would be required to obtain shareholder approval in order to be in compliance with applicable nasdaq rules 
under the laws of england and wales  we are not permitted to sell our adss at a purchase price that is less than the nominal value of our ordinary shares 
currently  the nominal value per ordinary share is 
as of march   the closing market price of our shares was per share 
as a result  we do not anticipate selling any shares under our agreement with fusion capital until the market price of our shares increases from current levels 
in addition  the sale of our shares to fusion capital under the agreement is subject to other conditions which have not been met 
under the terms of the agreement  we issued to fusion capital one redeemable warrant for adss representing  ordinary shares  and one non redeemable warrant for adss representing  ordinary shares 
the redeemable warrant may be redeemed by insignia at any time on or before june  for an aggregate redemption price of  the exercise price per ordinary share of each warrant is the us dollar equivalent of pence 
each warrant expires on september  and are partially exercisable 
as of december   the estimated value of the warrants  using the black scholes model  was  unless an event of default occurs under the agreement  the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants must be held by fusion capital until months from the date of the agreement or the date the agreement is terminated 
the warrrants are immediately exercisable  however  fusion capital may not exercise the warrants if fusion capital  together with its affiliates  would beneficially own more than of our shares outstanding at the time of the exercise by fusion capital 
the agreement and the forms of the registration rights agreement  the redeemable warrant and the non redeemable warrant between insignia and fusion capital are filed as exhibits to the k dated october  based upon our current forecasts and estimates  our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from on going operations and other liquid sources of cash including the securities subscription and cash generated from the sale of the jvm business to esmertec available to us may not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures 
if cash currently available from all sources is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek additional sources of financing including selling additional equity or obtaining convertible debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our shares  and the terms of such securities could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing as and when needed and on acceptable terms  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned sales  marketing and product development efforts  which could jeopardize our business 
the size of our accumulated deficit  our losses and our ongoing need for capital in order to continue our operations raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue operations 
failure to reduce expenses and or obtain additional financing will result in a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our business objectives and continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent accountants on our financial statements included in this annual report on form k includes an explanatory paragraph as to the uncertainty that we will continue as a going concern 
private placements and warrants on december   we entered into agreements whereby we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of per share to castle creek technology partners llc and four other investors of whom one is a member of our

in addition  we must issue  in return for payment of the nominal value of per share  ads for each ads purchased in the private placement for each month thereafter until the suspension or stop order is lifted

each unit comprises one ads and one half of one warrant to purchase one ads

on october   we entered into a securities subscription agreement with fusion capital  which is described above and in risk factors we need additional financing to sustain our operations 
dilution adjustments in december  we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price of per share through a private placement 
we received million less offering expenses totaling million 
along with adss  we also issued to the investors warrants that entitle them to purchase a total of  adss at an exercise price of per ads 
as described below  the exercise price and the number of adss issuable under the warrants were subject to potential adjustment 
under the december private placement  the investors received warrants to purchase three adss for every adss they purchased 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at of the original per ads purchase price  or 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss which may be issued if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants  which ends on december  the private placement that closed on november  was a sale which triggered the anti dilution provisions in the warrants  and  as a consequence  the exercise price of the warrants has been decreased from to per ads  and the number of adss purchasable has increased to  the private placement on february  also triggered the anti dilution provisions of the issuance of december  however  the effect of such dilution was less than of the exercise price and consequently such adjustment is deferred until such time as the accumulation of this adjustment and future adjustments exceed at least of the exercise price 
the issuance of warrants to fusion on october  triggered the anti dilution provisions of the issuance of december  the deferred february  adjustment will be added to this recent adjustment  such that the exercise price of the warrants shall be decreased and the number of adss which may be issued shall increase 
in a private placement that closed on november   certain investors purchased from us a total of  units at a price of per unit 
each unit comprises one ads and one half of one warrant to purchase one ads 
the exercise price of the warrants was set at an exercise price per ads equal to the lower of and the average quoted closing sale price of our adss for the ten trading days ending on the day preceding the day we are informed of the investor s intent to exercise  less a discount 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss purchasable if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants  which ends on november  the issuance of warrants to fusion on october  triggered the anti dilution provisions of this november issuance 
on february   we entered into agreements whereby we issued  ordinary shares in ads form at a price per share of per unit to a total of investors 
we also issued warrants to purchase  adss to the investors at an exercise price of the lower of the average quoted closing sale price of our ads s for the ten trading days ending on the day proceeding the date of the warrant holder s intent to exercise less a discount  and 
the warrants expire on february   however  subject to certain conditions  if the quoted sale price of the adss exceed per share for any thirty consecutive trading days  we may cancel the warrants upon sixty days prior written notice 
however  the warrants contain anti dilution provisions which decrease this exercise price and increase the number of adss which may be issued  if we sell or are deemed to sell any shares at below market price during the term of the warrants 
the issuance of warrants to fusion was a sale which triggered the anti dilution provisions in the warrants 
as part of their warrant agreements  the investors may be entitled to cash payments upon the occurrence of certain major transactions  as defined in the warrant agreements  including change of control provisions 
cash payments are determined in a methodology described in the agreement 
such methodology is impacted by market price 
a major transaction is defined as a merger  reorganizations or sale of all or substantially all assets of insignia in which the stockholders of insignia immediately prior to the transaction possess less than of the voting power of the surviving entity or its parent immediately after the transaction 
under the december private placement  the investors were entitled to additional warrants to purchase ads s at nominal value per share if the average of the closing bid price of the ads s over the ten days before an adjustment date was less than 
the adjustment dates commenced on march  and occurred on the th of each month through march   inclusive 
the rights for an adjustment date to occur would terminate upon release of at least million of the funds held in escrow by citrix on december  however  not enough of the funds held were released to trigger this termination 
the calculated average bid price of our ads s on all the adjustment dates exceeded per share and consequently no adjustment occurred 
the adjustment rights have now expired 
we obtained a third party valuation to allocate fair value to amounts received from the private placement between the adss and the warrants 
in the amount allocated to mandatorily redeemable warrants totaled million  of which million was allocated to the warrants  and million was allocated to the additional warrants 
of the remaining net proceeds received  million was allocated to mandatorily redeemable capital 
the million of mandatorily redeemable capital was reclassed when the registration statement for the adss and the adss underlying the warrants issued in the december private placement became effective on march   of which million was classified as ordinary shares and million was classified as additional paid in capital 
amounts classified as warrants will remain outside of shareholders equity for the life of the warrant or until they are exercised  whichever occurs first 
this classification reflects certain potential cash payments that may occur  should we complete a major transaction  such as a takeover  during the life of the warrants 
if a major transaction had occurred as of december   the maximum cash payout would have been approximately  based on the estimated black scholes value of the warrant 
limitations in the transaction agreements preclude these investors in question from achieving certain levels of beneficial ownership 
the securities purchase agreement  the warrants and the additional warrants contain the restriction that we may not issue and a selling investor may not purchase  and the warrants and additional warrants may not be exercised for any adss if doing so would cause such investor to beneficially own more than of the total ordinary shares in issue as determined in accordance with section d of the securities exchange act of under the additional warrants  if such investors are prohibited from exercising the additional warrant as a result of the restriction  the selling investor may  at its option and in addition to its other rights under the securities purchase agreement and the warrant  retain the warrant or demand payment  in cash  from us in an amount calculated by the black scholes formula multiplied by the number of adss for which the additional warrant was exercisable  without regard to any limits on exercise 
the restrictions on the levels of beneficial ownership in these documents do not  however  restrict those investors from exercising the warrants or additional warrants up to those limitations  selling adss to decrease their level of beneficial ownership  and exercising the warrants to receive additional adss 
this could result in additional dilution to the holders of our adss and a potential decrease in the price of the adss 
any significant downward pressure on the price of our adss as a result of the exercise of the warrants or additional warrants and the sale of material amounts of our adss could encourage short sales of our adss 
short sales could place further downward pressure on the price of our adss 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasbs emerging issues task force eitf reached final consensus on eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
eitf generally requires that consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer be clasified in a vendor s financial statements not as an expense  but as an offset to revenue up to the amount of cumulative revenue recognized or to be recognized

sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which was effective january  sfas supersedes fasb statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 

this statement retains many of the fundamental provisions of sfas and expands the scope of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
we adopted sfas effective january  the implementation of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
we will adopt sfas during the first quarter ending march  the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf prior to the adoption of sfas the effect on adoption of sfas will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
we will adopt sfas during the first quarter ending march  and do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the eitf reached a final consensus on income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which was effective for financial statements beginning after december  eitf requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  generally  be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
we adopted eitf effective january  we have historically recorded reimbursements of out of pocket expenses as net amounts in cost of services revenue in the statement of operations 
in accordance with the transition guidance included in eitf  adoption required the reclassification of financial statements for prior periods presented for comparative purposes 
the adoption of eitf did not affect our net loss  financial position or cash flows 
the reclassification did affect the presentation of certain revenue and cost of revenue items contained within our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

we have elected to continue accounting for employee stock option plans according to apb no 
 and we adopted the disclosure requirements under sfas no 
commencing on december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect this adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors in addtion to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we need additional financing to sustain our operations 
we had working capital of million at december   and our cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash totaled million at december  we had an operating cash flow deficit of million for the twelve months ended december  and an operating cash flow deficit of million for the year ended december  the sale of our jvm business to esmertec is expected to provide cash of  in because our current financial resources are not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations or those of our subsidiaries  we need additional funds to continue these operations 
there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on terms that are acceptable  or at all or that the esmertec transaction will be completed 
these circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
accordingly  the report of our independent accountants included on our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report includes an explanation paragraph as to the uncertainty that we will continue as a going concern 
we only have the right to receive  per trading day  up to an aggregate of million over a period of months under the agreement with fusion capital unless our stock price equals or exceeds  in which case the daily amount may be increased  at the option of insignia  as the price of our shares increases 
fusion capital will not have the right nor be obligated to purchase any of our shares on any trading days that the market price of our shares is less than per share 
since we initially registered  shares for sale by fusion capital in addition to  shares exercisable pursuant to warrants held by insignia  the selling price of our shares to fusion capital will have to average at least per share for us to receive the maximum proceeds of million without registering additional shares 
assuming a purchase price of per share the closing sale price per share of our adss on october  and the purchase by fusion capital of the full  shares under the securities subscription agreement with insignia  proceeds to us would be million unless we choose to register more than  shares  which we have the right  but not the obligation  to do 
in order to be in compliance with nasdaq rules  we could not sell our ordinary shares to fusion capital at a price below  which represents the greater of the book value per share of our ordinary shares as of september  or the closing sale price per share of our adss on october  if we elect to sell our shares to fusion capital at a price per share below  we first would be required to obtain shareholder approval in order to be in compliance with the nasdaq rules 
under the laws of england and wales  we are not permitted to sell our adss at a purchase price that is less than the nominal value of our ordinary shares 
currently  the nominal value per ordinary share is 
the extent we rely on fusion capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including our financial performance and ability to generate revenues  the prevailing market price of our shares and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
if obtaining sufficient financing from fusion capital were to prove prohibitively expensive  we may need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs 
even if we are able to access the full million under the securities subscription agreement with fusion capital  we may still need additional capital to implement our business  operating and development plans 
such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  security holders may experience dilution  and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our ordinary shares 
if our stock price does not exceed per share  we could be delisted from nasdaq 
further  we may not be able to develop new products or enhance our existing products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
whether or not additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  sale of additional equity or by other means  insignia s stock price may not remain above 
during the twelve months ended february   the closing price of our shares ranged from a high of to a low of 
under the rules of the nasdaq stock market  our stock price must remain above per share for continued quotation of our shares on the nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market 
we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with this requirement and that we would be provided calendar days  or until december   to regain compliance 
in connection with this notification  we transferred the listing of our shares from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market on january  to obtain additional time and flexibility to meet this requirement 
the sale of our shares to fusion capital may cause dilution  and the sale of the shares by fusion capital could cause the price of our shares to decline 
the purchase price for the shares to be issued to fusion capital pursuant to the securities subscription agreement with fusion capital will fluctuate based on the price of our shares 
all shares sold to fusion capital under the securities subscription agreement will be freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares purchased from us at any time 
we expect that the shares to be sold to fusion capital will be sold over a period of up to months from the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with the transaction 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of such shares at any given time could cause the trading price of our shares to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
we may never achieve profitability if our jeode and ssp product lines do not reach desired sales goals 
our future performance depends upon sales of products within our jeode and ssp product lines 
revenues related to the jeode product line accounted for of our total revenue of million for the twelve months ended december  we incurred an operating loss of million for the twelve months ended december  revenue from the ssp product line is expected in late we have reduced our current expense levels  which will require total revenues of more than million per quarter to achieve an operating profit 
jeode or ssp may not achieve or sustain market acceptance or provide the desired revenue levels 
the jeode and ssp product lines are our sole product lines  and we rely  and expect to continue to rely upon  sales of jeode and ssp products for our revenue in the future 
the long and complex process of licensing our jeode and ssp product makes our revenue unpredictable 
our revenue is dependent upon our ability to license the jeode and ssp product to third parties 
licensing our jeode product is a long and complex process  which usually takes from or months to complete 
the sales cycle for the ssp product is expected to take longer than the typical six to nine months 
before committing to license our products  potential customers must generally consider a wide range of issues including product benefits  infrastructure requirements  ability to work with existing systems  functionality and reliability 
the process of entering into a development license with a company typically involves lengthy negotiations 
because of the sales cycle  it is difficult for us to predict when  or if  a particular prospect might sign a license agreement 
development license fees may be delayed or reduced because of this process 
upon completion of the sale of our jvm business to esmertec  our sole product line  which is still under development  will consist of our ssp products 
the ssp product became available for lab and market trials in early and will be available for shipment to customers in the second half of we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
if products that integrate our jeode technology do not sell well  we will not receive additional royalty payments on our licenses 
our success depends upon the use of our technology by our licensees in their smart devices 
our licensees undertake a lengthy process of developing systems that use our technology 
when a licensee enters into a development license with us  we normally require the licensee to prepay some future commercial use royalties  typically an amount projected to cover to months of future usage 
until a licensee has sales of its systems incorporating our technology which create sufficient commercial use royalties to surpass any prepayment to us  we do not receive any further royalties from that licensee 
we expect that the period of time between entering into a development license and actually recognizing commercial use royalties to be lengthy and difficult to predict 
if our license agreement with sun microsystems  inc is terminated or expires without renewal  we would not be able to market our jeode product line 
in the first quarter of  we signed a five year technology license and distribution agreement distribution agreement agreement with sun microsystems  inc under which sun established insignia as a sun authorized virtual machine provider 
the distribution agreement also grants us immediate access to the java compatibility test suite and the java technology source code 
the distribution agreement includes technology sharing and compatibility verification 
under the distribution agreement  we are required to pay sun a per unit royalty on each jeode enabled smart device shipped by our customers  plus a royalty on all development licenses between our customers and us 
in the third quarter of  we amended our distribution agreement with sun 
the amendment expanded the scope of the licensed technology  changed the royalty rate  limited the royalty obligations to only per units licensed  established a prepaid royalty schedule and extended the expiration date of the contract from march to june if the distribution agreement with sun terminates or expires without renewal  we would not be able to market our jeode product line 
any disruption in our relationship with sun would likely impair our sales of jeode 
in addition  any termination of the distribution agreement with sun would likely adversely impact our ability to receive amounts to be paid under our agreement with esmertec in connection with the sale of the jvm business 
we also license software development tool products from other companies to distribute with some of our products 
these third parties may not be able to provide competitive products with adequate features and high quality on a timely basis or to provide sales and marketing cooperation 
further  our products compete with products produced by some of our licensors 
when these licenses terminate or expire  continued license rights might not be available to us on reasonable terms 
we might not be able to obtain similar products to substitute into our tool suites 
through the date of this report  we have not experienced any major problems with our third party licenses 
we have a history of losses and we must generate significantly greater revenue if we are to achieve profitability 
we have experienced operating losses in each quarter since the second quarter of to achieve profitability  we will have to increase our revenue significantly 
our ability to increase revenues depends upon the success of our jeode product line 
jeode has only been available since march and it may not achieve market acceptance 
if we are unable to create revenues from jeode in the form of development license fees  maintenance and support fees  commercial use royalties and non recurring engineering services  our current revenues will be insufficient to sustain our business 
for the fiscal year and we spent and  respectively  of our total revenues on sales and marketing 
we expect to continue to incur disproportionately high sales and marketing expenses in the future 
to market jeode effectively  we must further develop direct sales channels in the smart device market 
we will continue to incur the expenses for a sales and marketing infrastructure before we recognize significant revenue from sales of the product 
because customers in the smart device market tend to remain with the same vendor over time  we believe that we must devote significant resources to each potential sale 
if potential customers do not design our products into their systems  the resources we have devoted to the sales prospect would be lost 
if we fail to achieve and sustain significant increases in our quarterly sales  we may not be able to continue to increase our investment in these areas 
with increased expenses  we must significantly increase our revenues if we are to become profitable 
if our new products or product enhancements fail to achieve customer acceptance  or if we fail to manage product transitions  our business reputation will likely suffer and revenues may decline 
the market for smart devices such as personal digital assistants pdas and mobile handsets is fragmented and characterized by technological change  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements 
our existing products will become less competitive or obsolete if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that anticipate the features and functionality that customers demand 
the success of our new product introductions will depend on our ability to accurately anticipate industry trends and changes in technology standards  complete and introduce new product designs and features in a timely manner  continue to enhance our existing product lines  offer our products across a spectrum of microprocessor families used in the smart devices market  and respond promptly to customers requirements and preferences 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns 
we have had difficulty managing the transition from older products in the past 
for example  between and  we transitioned from our softwindows product line to our ntrigue product line and began preparations for our jeode product line 
during this same period our yearly revenues dropped from a high of million in to a low of million in the decrease in revenues was partly because we did not timely introduce new products which could compensate for the decreasing demand for our softwindows product line 
development delays are commonplace in the software industry 
we have experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products in the past and are likely to experience delays in the future 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely basis or at all  competitive products  product enhancements and new products that respond to technological change  changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
in addition  we also face significant risks associated with the development and future deployment of our ssp products and the successful execution of the related business strategy 
upon completion of the sale of the jvm business to esmertec  the ssp products will comprise our sole product line 
during  we began development of a range of ssp products for the mobile handset and wireless carrier industry 
these ssp products build on our position as a virtual machine vm supplier for manufacturers of mobile devices and allow wireless carriers to build valuable incremental services 
the ssp product became available for lab and market trials in early calendar and will be available for shipment to customers in the second half of we have limited history with sales initiatives for new products 
additionally  the sales cycle for the ssp products is expected to take longer than the typical six to nine months to complete  as seen with the jeode product 
our targeted market is highly competitive 
our jeode product line is targeted for the smart device market 
the market for these products is fragmented and highly competitive 
this market is also rapidly changing and there are many companies creating products that compete or will compete with ours 
as the industry develops  we expect competition to increase in the future 
this competition may come from existing competitors or other companies that we do not yet know about 
our main competitors include aplix corporation  international business machines  kada systems  inc  and tao group 
the jeode product line is targeted at the emerging java based smart device marketplaces  which are rapidly changing and are characterized by an increasing number of new entrants whose products compete with the jeode platform 
if these competitors develop products that are cheaper or provide better performance or functionality than our jeode product line  our market share will drop 
many of our current competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do  and we might not be able to compete successfully against these companies 
competition could force us to reduce the prices of our products  which would result in reduced profit margins and could harm our ability to provide adequate service to our customers 
our pricing model for our software products is based on a range of mid priced development license packages  combined with low priced per unit royalty payments for each smart device that incorporates our technology  and may be subject to significant pricing pressures  including buy out arrangements 
also  the market may demand alternative pricing models in the future 
a variety of other potential actions by our competitors  including increased promotion and accelerated introduction of new or enhanced products  could also harm our competitive position 
fluctuations in our quarterly results could cause the market price of our shares to decline 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  the mix of and changes in customers to whom our products are sold  the mix of product and service revenue received during the quarter  the mix of development license fees and commercial use royalties received  the timing and acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us or by our competitors  changes in product pricing  buyouts of commercial use licenses  product life cycles  the level of our sales of third party products  variances in costs in fixed price contracts  purchasing patterns of customers  competitive conditions in the industry  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  business cycles and economic conditions that affect the markets for our products  and extraordinary events  such as litigation  and related charges 
all of these factors are difficult to forecast 
our future operating results may fluctuate due to these and other factors  including our ability to continue to develop innovative and competitive products 
an increasing amount of our sales orders involve products and services that yield revenue over multiple quarters or upon completion of performance 
if license agreements entered into during a quarter do not meet our revenue recognition criteria  even if we meet or exceed our forecast of aggregate licensing and other contracting activity  it is possible that our revenues would not meet expectations 
due to all of these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be viewed as an indication of our future performance 
in the past  we have experienced actual performance that did not meet financial market expectations 
it is likely that  in some future quarters  our operating results will again be below the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
international sales of our products  which we expect to comprise a significant portion of total revenues  expose us to the business and economic risks of international operations 
sales from outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal year and  respectively  and are expected to increase over time 
we market jeode to manufacturers of smart devices in europe and asia  particularly in japan 
economic conditions in asia and europe generally and fluctuations in the value of the japanese yen and the euro against the us dollar and british pound sterling could impair our revenues and results of operations 
international operations are subject to a number of other risks 
these risks include foreign government regulation  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries where we do business  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in  or imposition of  regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  potentially adverse tax consequences  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and staffing and managing foreign operations  general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability  hostilities with neighboring countries and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and possible recessionary environments in economies outside the united states 
product defects can be expensive to fix and may cause us to lose customers 
our software products  like all software products  may have undetected errors or compatibility problems 
this is particularly true when a product is first introduced or a new version is released 
despite thorough testing  our products might be shipped with errors 
if this were to happen  our products could be rejected by customers  or there might be costly delays in correcting the problems 
our products are increasingly used in systems that interact directly with the general public  such as in transportation and medical systems 
in systems such as these  the failure of our product could cause substantial property damage or personal injury  which would expose us to product liability claims 
our products are used for applications in business systems where the failure of our product could be linked to substantial economic loss 
our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability and other claims 
it is likely  however  that these provisions are not effective in all circumstances and in all jurisdictions 
we may not have adequate insurance against product liability risks and renewal of our insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
further  our errors and omissions insurance may not be adequate to cover claims 
as of the date of this report  we have not had any product liability claims or recalls against our jeode line of products 
however  a product liability claim or claim for economic loss brought against us in the future could lead to unexpected large expenses and lost sales 
also  if we ever had to recall our product due to errors or other problems  it would cost us a great deal of time  effort and expense 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in our databases against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
we believe we have taken prudent measures to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations 
however  these measures might not be sufficient 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced any major interruptions in our operations because of a catastrophic event 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or sell our products 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  product development  sales  marketing and operations personnel 
we do not have agreements with any of our key personnel that require them to work for us for a specific term  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and operations personnel  many of whom are in great demand 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense in the san francisco bay area  where our us operations are headquartered 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors could introduce similar or superior products  and we could lose market share 
we depend on our proprietary technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary 
our competitors could independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which software piracy of our products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
the status of us patent protection in the software industry is not well defined and will evolve as the united states patent and trademark office grants additional patents 
patents have been granted on fundamental technologies in software  and patents may issue that relate to fundamental technologies incorporated into our products 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may result in lawsuits and prevent us from selling our products 
as the number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights in our industry increases  products based on our technology may increasingly become the subject of infringement claims 
third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future 
infringement claims with or without merit could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  might not be available on terms acceptable to us 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation to determine the validity of any claims  whether or not the litigation is resolved in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks 
if there is an adverse ruling against us in any litigation  we may be required to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to infringing technology 
our failure to develop or license a substitute technology could prevent us from selling our products 
some security holders have rights under their warrants to purchase significant numbers of american depository shares adss at nominal value upon the occurrence of specified events which  if triggered  would dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders 
some security holders have rights to be issued additional adss by insignia if the registration statements covering their shares and the shares underlying their warrants are suspended for more than days in any month period 
we must issue a total of  adss if we suspend registration statement number for more than the days in any month period  and a total of  adss if we suspend registration statement number for more than the days in any month period 
we have not suspended registration statements for more than days in any month period in the past 
however  because registration statement number was not declared effective by the securities and exchange commission by may   we made available to certain investors an additional total of  adss 
three of four investors have purchased their adss and one investor has yet to purchase the shares available to it 
the purchase price shareholders have paid or will pay per additional ads is the nominal value  or per ads  which is the lowest amount these shares can be purchased under english law 
if we issue additional adss under these obligations  the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted 
some security holders have anti dilution rights  which  if triggered  would dilute the ownership interests of existing security holders 
certain investors who participated in our four private placements received warrants which have anti dilution protections 
this means that they are entitled to purchase an additional amount of ordinary shares  in the form of adss  if we issue ordinary shares at a price below market price 
the anti dilution protections  if triggered  increase the number of shares which the investors may purchase with their warrants 
the exact amount of the increase is not known until the anti dilution protections are actually triggered 
there are two ways the anti dilution protections can be triggered if we sell our securities in a transaction  such as a private placement financing  for a price that is lower than the ten day average price of our adss before the transaction  or if the warrants issued in those relevant private placements are exercised at a price less than the ten day average price of our adss at the time of exercise 
the issuance of the warrants to fusion under the securities subscription agreement triggered these anti dilution protections 
further  when some of the warrants we issued in the private placements are exercised  anti dilution protections will likely be triggered 
the amount of the anti dilution adjustment is based on a formula where the lower the price of the our adss as quoted on the nasdaq stock market  the greater the potential increase in the number of shares issuable to the warrants due to the anti dilution protections 
assuming that the warrants are exercised at the lowest exercise price possible under applicable law and pursuant to the terms of their respective agreements  the maximum amount of additional shares issuable to these investors would be approximately  these anti dilution adjustments could accelerate and increase the magnitude of a decline in the quoted share price of our adss 
warrant holders have the right to purchase an increasing amount of shares during a decline in the price of our adss 
if the warrant holders exercise their warrants and sell their shares in the open market during this time  downward pressure is added to the price 
this can further increase the anti dilution adjustments for the remaining warrant holders 
short sales of our shares may further the downward pressure on the price of our adss 
anti dilution adjustments and short sales may accelerate and compound a decline in the price of our adss 
shareholders will also be diluted as warrant holders gain the right to purchase an increasingly large number of shares due to their anti dilution protections 
we are at risk of securities litigation which  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
the prices for our adss have fluctuated widely in the past 
during the months ended february   the closing price per share of insignia ranged from a high of to a recent low of 
under the rules of the nasdaq stock market  our stock price must remain above per share for continued quotation of our shares on the nasdaq smallcap market 
stock price volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by us and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against high technology companies 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
regardless of the outcome  securities litigation may result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
our investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us in us courts because many of our assets and some of our management are located in england 
insignia is incorporated under the laws of england and wales 
one of our executive officers and two of our directors reside in england 
all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons  and a significant portion of our assets  are located outside of the united states 
it may not be possible for investors to serve a complaint within the united states upon these persons or to enforce against them or against us  in us courts  judgments obtained in us courts based upon the civil liability provisions of us securities laws 
there is doubt about the enforceability outside of the united states  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of civil liabilities based solely upon us securities laws 
the rights of holders of our shares are governed by english law  including the companies act  and by our memorandum and articles of association 
the rights of holders of our adss are also affected by english law 
these rights differ from the rights of security holders in typical us corporations 
insignia has undergone a class action lawsuit and an sec investigation in the past seven years 
on april   a class action lawsuit was filed against us alleging that we misrepresented our business  the strength of our sales force and our financial health 
the suit stemmed from our failure to achieve the consensus earnings estimates of research analysts in the first quarter following our initial public offering in november in august  we reached a memorandum of understanding to settle the suits 
although we never agreed with the allegations  we paid million to the plaintiffs  of which our insurance company paid million 
in february  we restated our financial results for the quarters ended march and june  we revised our revenue and net income numbers downward for these two quarters due to inflated revenues resulting from misstatement of inventory levels of one of our resellers by two of our sales and marketing personnel 
we agreed with the sec to cease and desist from engaging in similar accounting practices 
the two insignia sales and marketing people involved in the revenue misstatement are no longer with insignia and were forced to pay significant fines 
we did not have to pay any fines 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had  in cash held in foreign currencies as translated at period end foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our foreign currencies are british pound sterling and are primarily used for paying the local operating expenses of our uk office 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on operations resulted in income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we did not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities
