the bank further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers as well as maintaining the flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities 
the bank s primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities  paydowns of mortgage backed securities  sales calls of investments and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit outflows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank s primary investing activities are originating residential one to four family mortgage loans  commercial business and real estate loans  multi family loans  home equity lines of credit and consumer loans  and investing in mortgage and asset backed securities  us government and agency obligations  corporate bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
these activities are funded primarily by principal and interest payments on loans  maturities of securities  deposits and federal home loan bank of boston advances 
during the years ended december  and  berkshire bank s loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the bank s investments in mortgage and asset backed securities  us government and agency obligations  equity securities and corporate debt obligations totaled million and million  respectively 
the bank experienced a net increase in total deposits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by the bank and its local competitors and other factors 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
if the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  additional sources of funds are available through advances or a line of credit with the federal home loan bank and through a repurchase agreement with the depositors insurance fund 
outstanding commitments for all loans and unadvanced construction loans and lines of credit totaled million at december  management of berkshire bank anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december  totaled million 
the bank relies primarily on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to retain deposits 
occasionally  the bank will also offer special competitive promotions to its customers to increase retention and promote deposit growth 
based upon the bank s historical experience with deposit retention  management believes that  although it is not possible to predict future terms and conditions upon renewal  a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the bank 
the bank must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   berkshire bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with tier capital to average assets of million  or of average assets  which is above the required level of million  or  and total capital to risk weighted assets of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or 
the bank meets the conditions to be considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
the primary source of funding for berkshire hills is dividend payments from berkshire bank  sales and maturities of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  earnings on investments and deposits held by berkshire hills 
dividend payments by berkshire bank have primarily been used to fund stock repurchase programs and pay dividends to berkshire hills shareholders 
the bank s ability to pay dividends and other capital distributions to berkshire hills is generally limited by the massachusetts banking regulations and regulations of the federal deposit insurance corporation 
see regulation and supervision massachusetts regulation additionally  the massachusetts commissioner of banks and federal deposit insurance corporation may prohibit the payment of dividends which are otherwise permissible by regulation for safety and soundness reasons 
any dividend by the bank beyond its current year s earnings and prior two years retained net income would require the approval of the massachusetts commissioner of banks  and notification to or approval of the federal deposit insurance corporation and the office of thrift supervision 
to the extent the bank were to apply for a dividend distribution to berkshire hills in excess of the regulatory permitted dividend amount  no assurances can be made such application would be approved by the regulatory authorities

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
impact of new accounting standards accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  under sfas no 
 acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of sfas no 
and  accordingly  intangible assets related to such transactions continued to amortize upon the adoption of sfas no 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
this statement amends except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope core deposit intangibles of financial institutions 
accordingly  such intangibles are subject to a recoverability test based on undiscounted cash flows  and to the impairment recognition and measurement provisions that are required for other long lived assets that are held and used 
the adoption of these statements did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the principal objectives of berkshire bank s interest rate risk management are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with its established policies 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which meets quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the executive committee of the board of directors and the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the asset liability committee consists of berkshire bank s president and chief executive officer  senior vice president and chief financial officer  senior vice president retail banking and operations  senior vice president retail lending  senior vice president commercial lending  vice president and controller  and vice president of trust 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of berkshire bank 
in recent years  berkshire bank has managed interest rate risk by o emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate loans and  from time to time  selling a portion of its longer term fixed rate loans as market interest rate conditions dictate  o originating shorter term commercial and consumer loans  o investing in a high quality liquid securities portfolio that provides adequate liquidity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from fluctuations in market interest rates  the overall maturity and duration of which is monitored in relation to the repricing of its loan portfolio  o promoting lower cost liability accounts such as core deposits  and o using federal home loan bank advances to better structure maturities of its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
berkshire bank s market risk also includes equity price risk 
berkshire bank s marketable equity securities portfolio had gross unrealized gains of million at december  and gross unrealized losses of  which are included  net of taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of berkshire bank s equity 
if equity securities prices decline due to unfavorable market conditions or other factors  berkshire bank s and berkshire hills capital would decrease 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income  incorporating various assumptions regarding the shape of the yield curve  the pricing characteristics of loans  deposits and borrowings  prepayments on loans and securities and changes in the balance sheet mix 
the model assumes the yield curve is derived from the interpolated treasury yield curve and that an instantaneous increase or decrease of market interest rates would cause a simultaneous parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
loans  deposits and borrowings are expected to reprice at the new market rate on the contractual review or maturity date 
the company closely monitors its loan prepayment trends and uses prepayment guidelines set forth by freddie mac and fannie mae as well as company generated figures where applicable 
all prepayments are assumed to roll over into new loans originated in the same loan category at the new market rate 
berkshire hills further assumes that its securities cash flows  especially its mortgage backed securities cash flows  are such that they will generally follow industry standards and that prepayments will be reinvested in the same category at the prevailing market rate 
finally  the model assumes that its balance sheet mix will remain relatively unchanged throughout the next calendar year 
the tables below set forth  as of december  and  estimated net interest income and the estimated changes in berkshire hills net interest income for the next twelve month period which may result given instantaneous increases or decreases in market interest rates of and basis points 
increase decrease in at december  market interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  increase decrease in at december  market interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands static  the december  table indicates that in the event of a sudden and sustained decline in prevailing market interest rates of basis points and basis points  berkshire hills net interest income would be expected to decrease by  and million  respectively 
the primary reasons for the decreases in a declining interest rate environment are that interest rate floors on deposit accounts would be reached and that the company has a high level of option risk  including the risk that customers will prepay high rate loans 
these figures vary from the results of the december  table that indicates in the event of a sudden and sustained decline of basis points  berkshire hills net interest income would be expected to increase  and in the event of a basis point decline  net interest income would be expected to decrease  the primary reason for this difference is that in many deposit accounts had reached or had come close to reaching company determined floors  while in for a basis point decline in rates the accounts had not yet reached these floors and the company benefited from being liability sensitive 
in the event of a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates of and basis points  the table indicates that net interest income would decrease  and million  respectively 
this result is due to the fact that the company s balance sheet is liability sensitive and predetermined caps on various deposit accounts would not be reached 
this compares to the table that indicates in the event of an increase of basis points  net interest income would decrease  and in the event of an increase of basis points  net interest income would increase  the difference in the positive basis point scenario is that the table indicates that the company s deposit accounts would have reached company determined caps  while in the table the deposit accounts are just approaching these caps 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on a number of assumptions including the level of market interest rates  the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates  the expected prepayment rates on loans and investments  the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and other deposit flows 
as a result  these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates
