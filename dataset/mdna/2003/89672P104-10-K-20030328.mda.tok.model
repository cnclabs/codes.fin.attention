overview we design and sell amplifiers based on our proprietary digital power processing technology 
we currently supply amplifiers for audio electronics applications  and have begun offering amplifiers for dsl applications 
we were incorporated in july  and we began shipping products in the first quarter of accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history for use in evaluating our company and our future prospects 
we incurred net losses before charge for beneficial conversion of million of approximately million in  million in and million in we expect to continue to incur net losses in  and possibly beyond 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to original equipment manufacturers and end users  net of sales returns and allowances 
our sales to distributors are made under arrangements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances and we defer recognition on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
all of our sales are made in united states us dollars 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we contract with third party semiconductor fabricators to manufacture the silicon wafers based on our integrated circuit ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we also contract with third party assembly and test houses to assemble and package our die and conduct final product testing 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers and die manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly and final product testing  as well as salaries and overhead costs associated with employees engaged in activities related to manufacturing 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related overhead costs associated with employees engaged in research  design and development activities  as well as the cost of wafers and other materials and related services used in the development process 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related overhead expenses and advertising and marketing expenses 
stock based compensation expense relates both to stock based employee and consultant compensation arrangements 
employee related stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of options to purchase that stock and is being recognized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the related options  usually four years  or in the case of fully vested options  in the period of grant 
consultant stock based compensation expense is based on the black scholes option pricing model 
future compensation charges will be reduced if any employee or consultant terminates employment or consultation prior to the expiration of the option vesting period 
critical accounting policies use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  accruals  stock options  warrants  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred taxes and restructuring costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from the other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
material differences may occur in our results of operations for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to original equipment manufacturers and end users  net of reserves for estimated returns and allowances  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collectibility of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
sales to distributors are made under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  generally under product warranty provisions  stock rotation rights and price protection on products unsold by the distributor 
in addition  the distributor may request special pricing and allowances which may be granted subject to approval by us 
as a result of these returns rights and potential pricing adjustments  we defer recognition on sales to distributors until products are resold by the distributor to the end user 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventory  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventory 
we determine excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimate of the future demand and estimated selling prices for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for expected demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
if our unit demand forecast is less than our current inventory levels and purchase commitments  during the specified time horizon  or if the estimated selling price is less than our inventory value  we will be required to take additional excess inventory charges or write downs to net realizable value which will decrease our gross margin and net operating results in the future 
during the period ended march   we recorded a provision for excess inventory of approximately million related to excess inventory for our ta product as a result of a decrease in forecasted sales for this product 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for was million  an increase of million or from revenue of million for the increase in revenue resulted primarily from increased shipments of our ta  ta and tk products  offset partially by decreased shipments of our tab and ta products 
revenue for increased million or from revenue of million in the increase in revenue from to resulted primarily from increased shipments of our ta product 
our top five end customers accounted for of revenue in versus and in and respectively 
our primary customers in were apple computer inc and apex digital inc  representing and of revenue  respectively 
in our primary customers were sony corporation and apple computer inc  representing and of revenue  respectively 
sony corporation and apple computer inc were also our top two customers in  representing and of revenue  respectively 
in we were able to offset the decline in revenue from sony with increased shipments related to design wins with existing and new customers 
the percentage of revenue to end customers located outside of the united states was in  in and in gross profit loss 
gross loss for was million including stock based compensation expense of  compared to a gross profit of million including stock based compensation benefit of  for and a gross loss of million including stock based compensation expense of  for the gross loss for was primarily due to a reserve of million for excess inventory during the first quarter of the inventory charge  related to excess inventory for our ta product  was based on a decline in forecasted sales for this product 
excluding the inventory charge  gross profit for the year ended december  was million 
the increase in gross profit was due to increased revenues and ongoing product cost reduction efforts 
the increase in gross profit in compared with the gross loss in was due to better product mix  including increased shipments of higher power higher margin products related to new design wins  as well as ongoing cost reduction efforts 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses for were million including stock based compensation expense of  a decrease of million or from r d expenses of million including stock based compensation benefit of  in the decrease in r d expenses was due to a decrease in personnel costs due to reduced headcount and a decrease in product development expenses 
r d expenses for decreased million or from r d expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of million in excluding stock based compensation expense  r d expenses increased million from to  driven by higher headcount related costs  as well as higher depreciation  rent and insurance expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were million including stock based compensation benefit of  a decrease of million or from sg a expenses of million including stock based compensation expense of  in the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to decreased headcount and related costs and lower professional services costs 
sg a expenses for decreased million or from sg a expenses of million in including stock based compensation expense of million 
excluding stock based compensation expense  sg a expenses were unchanged from to included a one time charge for forgiveness of stockholder notes receivable  which was offset in by higher headcount related costs and professional services expenses 
restructuring and other charges 
on august   we announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan which included a workforce reduction and write off of abandoned assets 
as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  during the quarter ended september  under the restructuring and cost reduction plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees across all functions and mostly located at our headquarters facility in santa clara  california 
the workforce reduction resulted in a  charge relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits 
we also abandoned assets for a charge of  a summary of the restructuring and other charges is as follows total charges non cash charges cash payments work force reduction write off of abandoned assets interest and other income  net 
interest income for was  a decrease of  or from interest income of  in interest income for decreased  or from interest income of million in in and  the decrease resulted from decreases in our average cash equivalents and short term investment balances to fund operations  together with lower interest rates 
accretion on preferred stock 
accretion on preferred stock for was  compared to for the year over year increase was due to the financing transaction that was completed in january  in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private placement of non voting series a preferred stock and warrants 
the accretion related to the beneficial conversion feature represents the difference between the accounting conversion price and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the transaction  after valuing the warrants issued in connection with the financing transaction 
income taxes 
we have incurred no income tax expense to date 
as of december   we had available federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and state purposes 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various times through as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  research and development tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals 
we have recorded no tax benefit in our financial statements for these deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets will be recognized in future periods as any taxable income is realized and consistent profits are reported 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private sale of our equity securities  primarily the sale of preferred stock  through our initial public offering on august  and through a private placement in january net proceeds to us as a result of our initial public offering and our private placement were approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net loss of million  a decrease in inventory purchases of million and a provision for excess inventory of  million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used for operating activities during the year ended december  was million  the majority of which was used to fund operating losses and working capital 
cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to decrease in sale of short term investments and an increase in purchase of property and equipment 
in our investing activities used cash in the amount of million for the purchase of short term investments and capital equipment 
cash provided by financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the additional financing  details of which are summarized below 
in  our financing activities provided cash in the amount of million  the majority of which was derived from our initial public offering 
on january   we completed a financing in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private placement of non voting series a preferred stock and warrants  at per unit to a group of investors 
at a special meeting of stockholders held on march   our stockholders approved the issuance and sale of the series a preferred stock and warrants  which then automatically converted into  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
if our common stock trades at per share or greater for a period of out of trading days  we can require the holders to exercise the warrants 
as a result of the favorable conversion price of the shares and related warrants at the date of issuance  we recorded accretion of approximately million relating to the beneficial conversion feature at the date of the conversion  thereby increasing the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the year ended december  on july   we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a one year revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million  subject to certain restrictions in the borrowing base based on eligibility of receivables 
any advances under the credit agreement will be secured by our personal property and will bear interest at the prime rate plus per annum 
we have agreed to provide a security interest in our intellectual property solely  in the event that a judicial authority holds that this is necessary  to enable the financial institution to perfect the financial institution s security interest in the rights to payment and proceeds from sale of our personal property 
we have also agreed not to pledge our intellectual property to a third party 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and reporting covenants 
covenants relating to meeting minimum quarterly revenues  minimum tangible net worth and meeting the deadline for submission of reporting items were violated during the year ended december  waivers were obtained from the financial institution for each of the covenants that were violated 
the credit agreement was used to issue stand by letters of credit totaling million to collateralize our obligations to a third party for the purchase of inventory and to provide a security deposit for the lease of new office space 
at december   there was up to million available under the credit facility  subject to certain restrictions in the borrowing base 
the company believes that it is eligible to borrow up to million as of march  the amount by which the aggregate face amount of all outstanding stand by letters of credit exceeds the borrowing base  as determined by eligible receivables  represents the amount of restricted cash necessary to secure the letters of credit 
subsequent to december   we have reduced the amount of outstanding stand by letters of credit by million  from million to million 
our total potential commitments on our operating leases and inventory purchases as of december   were as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases capital lease inventory purchase commitments total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest present value of minimum lease payments less current portion of capital lease obligations long term capital lease obligations we expect our future liquidity and capital requirements will fluctuate depending on numerous factors including market acceptance and demand for current and future products  the timing of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products  the success of on going efforts to reduce our manufacturing costs as well as operating expenses and need for working capital for such items as inventory and accounts receivable 
we have incurred substantial losses and have experienced negative cash flow since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million at december  to conserve cash  we have implemented cost cutting measures and in august  implemented a restructuring program 
in addition  on january   we completed financing in which we raised million in gross proceeds through a private equity placement and in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a one year revolving credit facility of up to million  subject to certain restrictions in the borrowing base based on eligibility of receivables 
at march   we believe that we are eligible to borrow up to million against this credit agreement  of which approximately million is still available 
our independent accountants  have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   which indicates that we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a net stockholders deficit that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we respectfully disagree 
while we have incurred losses since our inception and are expected to incur losses this year at our current operating level  we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and could take other measures to reduce operating expenses if necessary to operate as a going concern for the next twelve months and perhaps beyond 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities next year and beyond through public or private equity or debt financings  the formation of strategic partnerships or alliances with other companies or through bank borrowings with existing or new banks 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to our stockholders and us  or at all 
without sufficient capital to fund our operations  we will no longer be able to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have not made any adjustment to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty described above

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report and in the other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this annual report and our other public filings 
risks related to our business our limited operating history and dependence on new technologies make it difficult to evaluate our future products 
we were incorporated in july but did not begin shipping products until some of our products have only recently been introduced 
accordingly  we have limited historical financial information and operating history upon which you may evaluate us and our products 
our prospects must be considered in the light of the risks  challenges and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development  particularly companies in intensely competitive and rapidly evolving markets such as the semiconductor industry 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in addressing these risks and challenges 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses before charge for beneficial conversion feature of million of approximately million in the year ended december   million in and million in we expect to continue to incur net losses and these losses may be substantial 
furthermore  we expect to generate significant negative cash flow in the future 
we will need to generate substantially higher revenue to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow 
our ability to generate future revenue and achieve profitability will depend on a number of factors  many of which are described throughout this section 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain profitability  we will be unable to build a sustainable business 
in this event  our share price and the value of your investment would likely decline and the company might be unable to continue as a going concern 
we may need to raise additional capital to continue to grow our business  which may not be available to us 
because we have had losses  we have funded our operating activities to date from the sale of securities  including our most recent financing in january additionally  in july we put in place a million revolving line of credit whose availability is dependent on meeting certain loan covenants 
however  to grow our business significantly  we will need additional capital 
we cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
moreover  additional equity financing  if available  would likely be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  would likely involve restrictive covenants 
if we cannot raise sufficient additional capital  it would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue as a going concern 
our independent accountants have included a going concern explanatory paragraph in their report on our consolidated fianancial statements 
our independent accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   which indicates that we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have a net stockholders deficit that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in our independent auditor s audit report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  could have a detrimental effect on our stock price  and our ability to raise new capital 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations  which would cause us to be in default under the terms of our credit facility  which would result in harm to our business and financial condition 
on july   we entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution that provides for a one year revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million 
any advances under the credit agreement will be secured by our personal property and will bear interest at the prime rate plus per annum 
we have agreed to provide a security interest in our intellectual property solely  in the event that a judicial authority holds that this is necessary  to enable the financial institution to perfect the financial institution s security interest in the rights to payment and proceeds from sale of our personal property 
we have also agreed not to pledge our intellectual property to a third party 
the credit agreement contains certain financial and reporting covenants 
covenants relating to meeting minimum quarterly revenues  minimum tangible net worth and meeting the deadline for submission of reporting items were violated during the year ended december  waivers were obtained from the financial institution for the covenants that were violated 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations of the credit facility 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations under the credit facility or otherwise  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the credit facility  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the financial institution that provided the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of our obligations 
any such default would harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the credit facility if payment were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any event of default under the terms of the credit facility 
in addition  in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the payments due under the credit facility due to an event of default  our assets would be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after our indebtedness has been paid in full 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to make any distributions to our stockholders 
we must continue to reduce our costs and improve our margins in order to reach profitability 
the market for our products is extremely competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing 
as a result  margins in our market are often low 
traditionally  we have experienced low or even negative margins 
to reach profitability  we must continue to increase our margins by reducing the cost of our products 
we have taken steps in the past and plan to take additional steps in and beyond to reduce our cost of manufacturing and improve our overall profit margin 
these efforts include but are not limited to  reducing the size of the semiconductor die  shifting production to lower cost semiconductor wafer and assembly and test suppliers  using lower cost test equipment and more cost efficient test programs  and moving from higher cost custom to lower cost standard size semiconductor packages 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in our efforts to reduce our manufacturing costs and improve our gross margins in the future 
our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
the many factors that could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate include  in part level of sales  mix of high and low margin products  availability and pricing of wafers  timing of introducing new products  including lower cost versions of existing products  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of products  and rate of development of target markets 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including salaries  rent and capital lease expenses  are fixed 
if we experience a shortfall in revenues relative to our expenses  we may be unable to reduce our expenses quickly enough to off set the reduction in revenues during that accounting period  which would adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in our operating results may also result in fluctuations in our common stock price 
if the market price of our stock is adversely affected  we may experience difficulty in raising capital or making acquisitions 
in addition  we may become the object of securities class action litigation 
as a result  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of future performance 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility 
the stock prices for many technology companies have recently experienced large fluctuations  which may or may not be directly related to the operating performance of the specific companies 
broad market fluctuations as well as general economic conditions may cause our stock price to decline 
we believe that fluctuations of our stock price may continue to be caused by a variety of factors  including announcements of developments related to our business  fluctuations in our financial results  general conditions in the stock market or around the world  terrorism or developments in the semiconductor and capital equipment industry and the general economy  sales or purchases of our common stock in the marketplace  announcements of our technological innovations or new products or enhancements or those of our competitors  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights  developments in our relationships with customers and suppliers  a shortfall or changes in revenue  gross margins or earnings or other financial results from analysts expectations or an outbreak of hostilities or natural disasters  or acquisition or merger activity and the success in implementing such acquisitions 
our customers may cancel or defer product orders  which could result in excess inventory 
our sales are generally made pursuant to individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty 
thus  orders in backlog may not result in future revenue 
in the past  we have had cancellations and deferrals by customers 
any cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in us holding excess inventory  which could seriously harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
during the quarter ended march   we recorded a provision for excess inventory of approximately million 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to the end customer 
although we have not experienced customer refusals to accept shipped products or material difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  such refusals or collection difficulties are possible and could result in significant charges against income  which could seriously harm our revenues and our cash flow 
industry wide overcapacity has caused and may continue to cause our results to fluctuate  and such shifts could result in significant inventory write downs and adversely affect our relationships with our suppliers 
we must build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and in light of the current downturn  which has resulted in excess capacity and overproduction  there is a risk that we will continue to forecast inaccurately and produce excess inventories of our products 
as a result of such inventory imbalances  large future inventory write downs may occur due to excess inventory or inventory obsolescence 
in addition  any adjustment in our ordering patterns resulting from increased inventory may adversely affect our suppliers willingness to meet our demand  if our demand increases in the future 
our product shipment patterns make it difficult to predict our quarterly revenues 
as is common in our industry  we frequently ship more products in the third month of each quarter than in either of the first two months of the quarter  and shipments in the third month are higher at the end of that month 
we believe this pattern is likely to continue 
the concentration of sales in the last month of the quarter may cause our quarterly results of operations to be more difficult to predict 
moreover  if sufficient business does not materialize or a disruption in our production or shipping occurs near the end of a quarter  our revenues for that quarter could be materially reduced 
we rely on a small number of customers for most of our revenue and a decrease in revenue from these customers could seriously harm our business 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for most of our revenues to date 
any reduction or delay in sales of our products to one or more of these key customers could seriously reduce our sales volume and revenue and adversely affect our operating results 
in particular  sales to three large customers  including apex digital inc  apple computer and aiwa which became a wholly owned subsidiary of sony corporation in february accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of revenue for the year ended december     and respectively  of total revenue in and  and respectively in moreover  sales to our five largest end customers represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december   of our total revenue in and of our total revenue in we expect that we will continue to rely on the success of our largest customers and on our success in selling our existing and future products to those customers in significant quantities 
however  we cannot be sure that we will retain our largest customers or that we will be able to obtain additional key customers or replace key customers we may lose or who may reduce their purchases 
we currently rely on sales of six products for a significant portion of our revenue  and the failure of these products to be successful in the future could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely on sales of our tab  ta  ta  ta  ta and tk digital audio amplifiers to generate a significant portion of our revenue 
sales of these products amounted to of our revenue for the year ended december   of our revenue in and of our revenue in we have developed additional products and plan to introduce more products in the future  but there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially successful 
consequently  if our existing products are not successful  our sales could decline substantially 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if or when a sale will be made  to forecast our revenue and to budget expenses  which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results 
because of our lengthy sales cycles  we may continue to experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative efforts  as well as increasing investments in inventory  and the generation of revenue  if any  from such expenditures 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in our loss of anticipated sales 
our new products are generally incorporated into our customers products or systems at the design stage 
to try and have our products selected for design into new products of current and potential customers  commonly referred to as design wins  often requires significant expenditures by us without any assurance of success 
once we have achieved a design win  our sales cycle will start with the test and evaluation of our products by the potential customer and design of the customer s equipment to incorporate our products 
generally  different parts have to be redesigned to incorporate our devices successfully into our customers products 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our products can range from a minimum of three to six months  and it can take a minimum of an additional six to nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
achieving a design win provides no assurance that such customer will ultimately ship products incorporating our products or that such products will be commercially successful 
our revenue or prospective revenue would be reduced if a significant customer curtails  reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
the current general economic downturn in the semiconductor industry has lead and may continue to lead to decreased revenue 
during and  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors has resulted in significant inventory buildups for semiconductor companies 
presently  we have no visibility regarding how long the semiconductor industry downturn will last or how severe the downturn will be 
if the downturn continues or worsens  we may experience greater levels of cancellations and or push outs of orders for our products in the future  which could adversely affect our business and operating results  including the possibility of additional inventory write downs  over a prolonged period of time 
in addition  we reduced our workforce during fiscal by approximately  or about people 
if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any renewed growth opportunities in the future 
we may experience difficulties in the introduction of new or enhanced products that could result in significant  unexpected expenses or delay their launch  which would harm our business 
our failure or our customers failure to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a timely manner would seriously harm our ability to generate revenues 
consequently  our success depends on our ability to develop new products for existing and new markets  introduce such products in a timely and cost effective manner and to achieve design wins 
the development of these new devices is highly complex  and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
the successful introduction of a new product may currently take up to months 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achieving acceptable manufacturing yields  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and market competition 
we seek but cannot guarantee success with regard to these factors 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
we may not be successful in retaining executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
a high level of technical expertise is required to support the implementation of our technology in our existing and new customers products 
in addition  the loss of the management and technical expertise of dr 
adya s 
tripathi  our founder  president and chief executive officer  could seriously harm us 
we do not have any employment contracts with our employees 
our headquarters  as well as the facilities of our principal manufacturers and customers  are located in geographic regions with increased risks of power supply failure  natural disasters  labor strikes and political unrest 
our headquarters is located in san jose  california  an area on or near a known earthquake fault within the state 
in addition  in the past the state of california has experienced a shortage of available electrical power  which has resulted in electrical blackouts for businesses in certain areas 
in the event that california experiences another shortage of available electrical power  and there are additional blackouts  the operations of our facilities within california could be disrupted 
our principal manufacturers and customers are located in the pacific rim region 
the risk of earthquakes in this region  particularly in taiwan  is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines 
earthquakes  fire  flooding and other natural disasters in the pacific rim region likely would result in the disruption of our foundry partners assembly and testing capacity and the ability of our customers to purchase our products 
labor strikes or political unrest in these regions would likely also disrupt operations of our foundries and customers 
in particular  there is a recent history of political unrest between china and taiwan 
any disruption resulting from such events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing  assembly and testing from the affected contractor to another third party vendor 
we cannot be sure that such alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
moreover  any such disruptions could also cause significant decreases in our sales to these customers until our customers resume normal purchasing volumes 
stockholders will incur additional dilution upon the exercise of warrants  and management will have sole discretion to use the proceeds received from exercise of these warrants 
to the extent that the warrants issued in connection with the january series a financing are exercised  there will be additional dilution to your shares 
if all of the warrants are exercised  we will be required to issue an additional  shares of common stock  or approximately of the common stock outstanding as of december  if all of the warrants are exercised in full  we would receive approximately million in proceeds 
our management will have sole discretion over use of these proceeds and may spend the proceeds in ways with which our stockholders may not agree 
the market may be adversely affected due to the large number of shares eligible for sale under the registration statement filed in connection with the january financing 
the shares of common stock eligible for sale under the registration statement filed in connection with the january financing represent a large percentage of our outstanding common stock 
the market for our common stock may be adversely affected as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or the perception that large sales may occur 
we may not maintain the nasdaq small cap market listing requirements  and as a result  our common stock may be subject to delisting 
on august   we received a deficiency notice from the nasdaq stock market  or nasdaq  for failing to maintain the nasdaq national market s minimum bid price requirement for continued listing  which includes meeting a minimum bid price for consecutive trading days 
as we were unable to maintain this requirement  we submitted an application to nasdaq for transfer to their smallcap market 
the application was approved and accordingly we are now listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must meet the minimum listing requirement that the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or higher for a minimum of consecutive trading dates 
as we had not met this minimum listing requirement by the initial deadline of february   we applied for and  on february   were provided with  an additional days  or until august   to gain compliance with the nasdaq smallcap market minimum listing requirement 
if we are unable to meet the minimum listing requirement prior to august   we may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  or  in the alternative  we may be granted an additional grace period to regain compliance 
furthermore  we may be eligible to transfer back to the nasdaq national market if by august  the bid price of our common stock maintains the per share requirement for consecutive trading days and we have maintained compliance with all other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market 
on january   the nasdaq stock market  inc announced plans to extend a pilot program governing bid price rules for all nasdaq national market and nasdaq smallcap issuers 
the pilot program will allow issuers that meet core smallcap initial listing criteria to benefit from extended compliance periods for satisfying minimum bid price requirements 
if this term of the pilot program is extended  and if we meet the core smallcap initial listing criteria  we will be eligible to apply for an extended compliance period for satisfying the minimum bid price requirements 
stock trading on the nasdaq smallcap market is typically less liquid and usually involves larger variations between the bid and ask price than stock trading on the nasdaq national market 
therefore  the transfer of our stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and your ability to sell our common stock 
additionally  if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  sales of our common stock would likely be conducted only in the over the counter market or potentially in regional exchanges 
this may have a negative impact on the liquidity and the price of our common stock  and investors may find it more difficult to purchase or dispose of  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of  our common stock 
in addition  if our common stock is not listed on the nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market and the trading price of our common stock was to remain below per share  trading in our common stock would also be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the exchange act  which require additional disclosures by broker dealers in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally  a non nasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
in such event  the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers to effect transactions in our common stock could further limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock 
we also believe that the current per share price level of our common stock has reduced the effective marketability of our shares of common stock because of the reluctance of many leading brokerage firms to recommend low priced stock to their clients 
certain investors view low priced stock as speculative and unattractive 
in addition  a variety of brokerage house policies and practices tend to discourage individual brokers within those firms from dealing in low priced stock 
such policies and practices pertain to the payment of broker s commissions and to time consuming procedures that make the handling of low priced stocks unattractive to brokers from an economic standpoint 
in addition  because brokerage commissions on low priced stock generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stock  the current share price of our common stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs commissions  markups or markdowns that represent a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were substantially higher 
this factor also may limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock at its current low share price 
if we engage in acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs  and the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions may never be realized 
in the future we may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies and businesses 
we may have to issue debt or equity securities to pay for future acquisitions  which could be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
in addition  we may incur certain liabilities or other expenses in connection with future acquisitions  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any future acquisitions may involve numerous other risks  including difficulties assimilating the operations  personnel  technologies and products of the acquired companies  diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns  increased complexity and costs associated with internal management structures  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
for these reasons  among others  we cannot be certain what effect future acquisitions may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the threat of terrorist attacks in the united states  the current war with iraq and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a substantial adverse impact on the economy 
if consumer confidence does not recover  our revenues may be adversely impacted for fiscal and beyond 
moreover  any further terrorist attacks in the us  or any additional us military actions overseas may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers 
these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers 
this could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  shareholder rights plan  equity incentive plans  bylaws and delaware law may discourage transactions involving a change in corporate control 
in addition to the foregoing  the stockholdings of our officers  directors and persons or entities that may be deemed affiliates  our shareholder rights plan and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a third party from acquiring us and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of our common stock 
risks related to manufacturing we depend on three outside foundries for our semiconductor device manufacturing requirements 
we do not own or operate a fabrication facility  and substantially all of our semiconductor device requirements are currently supplied by three outside foundries  united microelectronics corporation  or umc  in taiwan  stmicroelectronics group in europe and mitsubishi  in japan 
although we primarily utilize these three outside foundries  most of our components are not manufactured at both foundries at the same time 
as a result  each foundry is a sole source for certain products 
there are significant risks associated with our reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of guaranteed wafer supply  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and control  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies 
in addition  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
although we work closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields  our foundries have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
we provide our foundries with continuous forecasts of our production requirements  however  the ability of each foundry to provide us with semiconductor devices is limited by the foundry s available capacity 
in many cases  we place our orders on a purchase order basis  and foundries may allocate capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing the deliveries to us on short notice 
in particular  foundry customers that are larger and better financed than us or that have long term agreements with our foundries may cause such foundries to reallocate capacity in a manner adverse to us 
if we use a new foundry  several months would be typically required to complete the qualification process before we can begin shipping products from the new foundry 
in the event either of our current foundries suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of foundry capacity  we may not be able to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner 
even our current outside foundries would need to have certain manufacturing processes qualified in the event of disruption at another foundry  which we may not be able to accomplish in a timely enough manner to prevent an interruption in supply of the affected products 
if we encounter shortages or delays in obtaining semiconductor devices for our products in sufficient quantities when required  delivery of our products could be delayed  resulting in customer dissatisfaction and decreased revenues 
we depend on third party subcontractors for most of our semiconductor assembly and testing requirements and any unexpected interruption in their services could cause us to miss scheduled shipments to customers and to lose revenues 
semiconductor assembly and testing are complex processes  which involve significant technological expertise and specialized equipment 
as a result of our reliance on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our products  we cannot directly control product delivery schedules  which has in the past  and could in the future  result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products 
almost all of our products are assembled and tested by one of five subcontractors ambit microsystems corporation in taiwan  amkor technology  inc in the philippines  ase in korea  malaysia and taiwan  sgs in china  and st assembly test services ltd 
in singapore 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these suppliers and retain their services on a per order basis 
the availability of assembly and testing services from these subcontractors could be adversely affected in the event a subcontractor suffers any damage or destruction to their respective facilities  or in the event of any other disruption of assembly and testing capacity 
due to the amount of time normally required to qualify assemblers and testers  if we are required to find alternative manufacturing assemblers or testers of our components  shipments could be delayed 
any problems associated with the delivery  quality or cost of our products could seriously harm our business 
failure to transition our products to more effective and or increasingly smaller semiconductor chip sizes and packaging could cause us to lose our competitive advantage and reduce our gross margins 
we evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce costs and have commenced migration of some products to smaller semiconductor processes 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor processes will be important for us to reduce manufacturing costs and to remain competitive 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to migrate to smaller semiconductor processes successfully 
we cannot be sure that our future process migrations will be achieved without difficulties  delays or increased expenses 
our gross margins would be seriously harmed if any such transition is substantially delayed or inefficiently implemented 
our international operations subject us to risks inherent in doing business on an international level that could harm our operating results 
we currently obtain almost all of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states and may expand our manufacturing activities abroad 
approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  was derived from sales to end customers based outside the united states 
in and  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from sales to end customers based outside of the united states 
in addition  we often ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
accordingly  we are subject to risks inherent in international operations  which include political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions and tariffs  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  import and export license requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in collecting receivables  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
all of our international sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of our overseas manufacturing  which would reduce our gross margins 
risks related to our product lines our ability to achieve revenue growth will be harmed if we are unable to persuade electronic systems manufacturers to adopt our new amplifier technology 
we face difficulties in persuading manufacturers to adopt our products using our new amplifier technology 
traditional amplifiers use design approaches developed in the s 
these approaches are still used in most amplifiers and engineers are familiar with these design approaches 
to adopt our products  manufacturers and engineers must understand and accept our new technology 
to take advantage of our products  manufacturers must redesign their systems  particularly components such as the power supply and heat sinks 
manufacturers must work with their suppliers to obtain modified components and they often must complete lengthy evaluation and testing 
in addition  our amplifiers are often more expensive as components than traditional amplifiers 
for these reasons  prospective customers may be reluctant to adopt our technology 
we currently depend on consumer audio markets that are typically characterized by aggressive pricing  frequent new product introductions and intense competition 
a substantial portion of our current revenue is generated from sales of products that address the consumer audio markets  including home theater  computer audio and the automotive audio markets 
these markets are characterized by frequent new product introductions  declining prices and intense competition 
pricing in these markets is aggressive  and we expect pricing pressure to continue 
in the computer audio segment  our success depends on consumer awareness and acceptance of existing and new products by our customers and consumers  in particular  the elimination of externally powered speakers 
in the automotive audio segment  we face pressure from our customers to deliver increasingly higher powered solutions under significant engineering limitations due to the size constraints in car dashboards 
in addition  our ability to obtain prices higher than the prices of traditional amplifiers will depend on our ability to educate manufacturers and their customers about the benefits of our products 
failure of our customers and consumers to accept our existing or new products will seriously harm our operating results 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing new and enhanced products for the dsl high speed communications markets that keep pace with technology and our customers needs  our operating results will suffer 
the market for our dsl products is new and emerging  and is characterized by rapid technological advances  intense competition and a relatively small number of potential customers 
this will likely result in price erosion on existing products and pressure for cost reduced future versions 
we recently started to ship our ta dsl line driver and expect to commence the testing phase of our dual channel line driver in the next couple of months 
implementation of our products require manufacturers to accept our technology and redesign their products 
if potential customers do not accept our technology or experience problems implementing our devices in their products  our products could be rendered obsolete and our business would be harmed 
if we are unsuccessful in introducing future products with enhanced performance  our ability to achieve revenue growth will be seriously harmed 
we may experience difficulties in the development and introduction of a new amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market  which could result in significant expenses or delay in its launch 
we are currently developing an amplifier product for use in the cellular phone market 
we currently have no design wins or customers for this product 
we may not introduce our amplifier product for the cellular phone market on time  and this product may never achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  competition in this market is likely to result in price reductions  shorter product life cycles  reduced gross margins and longer sales cycles compared with what we have experienced to date with our other products 
intense competition in the semiconductor industry and in the consumer audio and communications markets could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the semiconductor industry and the consumer audio and communications markets are highly competitive 
we compete with a number of major domestic and international suppliers of semiconductors in the audio and communications markets 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
many of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than us 
as a result  such competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
in addition  existing or new competitors may in the future develop technologies that more effectively address the transmission of digital information through existing analog infrastructures at a lower cost or develop new technologies that may render our technology obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  or that our business will not be harmed by increased competition 
our products are complex and may have errors and defects that are detected only after deployment in customers products  which may harm our business 
products such as those that we offer may contain errors and defects when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors and defects  in particular in the development stage of a new product 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our reputation and seriously harm our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors and defects could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require substantial redesign  manufacturing and testing which would result in significant expenditures of capital and resources 
despite testing conducted by us  our suppliers and our customers  we cannot be sure that errors and defects will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production 
such errors and defects could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and would likely harm our business 
downturns in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry and rapid technological change could result in substantial period to period fluctuations in wafer supply  pricing and average selling prices  which make it difficult to predict our future performance 
we provide semiconductor devices to the audio  personal computer and communications markets 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
as a result  we have experienced and may experience in the future substantial period to period fluctuations in our results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors  many of which are outside our control 
due to these risks  you should not rely on period to period comparisons to predict our future performance 
risks related to our intellectual property our intellectual property and proprietary rights may be insufficient to protect our competitive position 
our business depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure that such measures will provide meaningful protection for our proprietary technologies and processes 
as of december   we have issued united states patents  and additional united states patent applications which are pending 
in addition  we have international patents issued and an additional international patents pending 
we cannot be sure that any patent will issue as a result of these applications or future applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficient to protect our technology 
in addition  we cannot be sure that any existing or future patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any right granted thereunder would provide us meaningful protection 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products 
in connection with our participation in the development of various industry standards  we may be required to agree to license certain of our patents to other parties  including our competitors  that develop products based upon the adopted standards 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
some of our customers have entered into agreements with us pursuant to which such customers have the right to use our proprietary technology in the event we default in our contractual obligations  including product supply obligations  and fail to cure the default within a specified period of time 
we may be subject to intellectual property rights disputes that could divert management s attention and could be costly 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
from time to time  we may receive in the future notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these actions  or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents  misappropriation or misuse by us of third party trade secrets or the invalidity of one or more patents held by us will not be asserted or prosecuted against us  or that any assertions of infringement  misappropriation or misuse or prosecutions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents will not seriously harm our business 
for example  in a patent or trade secret action  an injunction could be issued against us requiring that we withdraw particular products from the market or necessitating that specific products offered for sale or under development be redesigned 
we have also entered into certain indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims  we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our management and personnel resources with respect to the defense of such claims  which could also seriously harm our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot be sure that under such circumstances a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  we often incorporate the intellectual property of our strategic customers into our designs  and we have certain obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of such intellectual property 
we cannot be sure that the steps taken by us to prevent our  or our customers  misappropriation or infringement of intellectual property will be successful 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
some of the securities that we may invest in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
currently  we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes
