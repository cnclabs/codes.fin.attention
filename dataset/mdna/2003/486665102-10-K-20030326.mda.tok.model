there are a number of important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  those set forth below under the caption certain factors that may affect future results 
overview keane plans  builds  manages  and rationalizes application software through its business consulting  application development and integration ad i  and application development and management outsourcing applications outsourcing services 
keane develops long term relationships with customers by providing a broad range of service offerings delivered on a local basis through an integrated network of branch offices in north america and in the united kingdom 
branch offices work in conjunction with the company s business consulting arm  keane consulting group kcg  and are supported by centralized strategic practices 
the practices focus on developing repeatable approaches to common customer needs and challenges and help to gather and institutionalize the company s best practices 
branch offices are also supported by advanced development centers adcs in the united states  canada  and india  which enable the company to further improve the efficiency and economic advantage of the services it provides customers 
given the recent economic downturn  many customers have deferred their investments in new information systems 
as a result  keane has concentrated its short term efforts on helping customers to more efficiently manage their existing applications 
this mix of services includes applications outsourcing and applications rationalization  a service that helps customers to identify and eliminate higher cost  non core  and end of life applications 
applications outsourcing is the company s flagship service offering  because it represents a large  growing market  and provides keane with long term contracts and a high percentage of recurring revenue 
keane has also increased its focus on providing services to vertical markets  such as healthcare and the public sector  that have been less impacted by reductions in technology spending 
in addition  the company seeks to provide cost effective services and to enhance its operating margins through the use of its near shore advanced development center in halifax  nova scotia  and its offshore advanced development centers in hyderabad and delhi  india 
the company acquired its offshore facilities as a result of its acquisition of signaltree solutions holding  inc signaltree 
the company anticipates that use of its near shore and offshore facilities will increase as a result of its focus on global delivery and the need of customers to continue to decrease costs associated with investments in technology 
finally  keane has maintained tight control of its costs while executing a strategy that has created a business model with high operating leverage 
in order for keane to remain successful in the near term  keane must continue to maintain and grow its client base  provide high quality service and satisfaction to its existing clients  and continue to take advantage of cross selling opportunities 
in the current economic environment  keane must also provide clients with service offerings that are appropriately priced  satisfy clients it needs  and provide clients with measurable business benefit 
keane believes that maximizing the generation of cash from operations is fundamental to building long term per share value 
to accomplish this  keane believes that its ability to sell and deliver applications outsourcing and to cross sell other services is critical to its long term success 
attracting  retaining  and developing talented sales  management  and technical professionals is another essential component 
in addition  the company s ability to leverage selling  general administrative sg a expense over a broader base of revenue is crucial to increasing net income and cash provided from operations 
keane s management measures keane s performance on a quarter by quarter and year over year basis by comparing plan  build  and manage revenues  applications outsourcing revenues  the number of billable personnel  gross margins  and sg a as a percentage of revenues for such periods 
another key metric used by keane s management is bookings  or new sales to customers 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of keane s financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires keane to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of keane s financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
keane s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition keane recognizes revenue as services are performed or products are delivered in accordance with contractual agreements and generally accepted accounting principles 
for general consulting engagements  revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis as services are delivered 
for the majority of our outsourcing engagements  the company provides a specific level of service each month for which it bills a standard monthly fee 
revenue for these engagements is recognized in monthly installments over the billable portion of the contract 
these installments may be adjusted to reflect changes in staffing requirements and service levels consistent with terms of the contract 
for fixed price engagements  revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the life of the contract 
the company uses estimated labor to complete to measure the percentage of completion 
percentage of completion recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of each engagement 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
revenue associated with application software products is recognized as the software products are installed and as implementation services are delivered 
software maintenance fees on installed products are recognized on a pro rated basis over the term of the agreement 
for the majority of outsourcing engagements  the company provides a specific level of service each month for which it bills a standard monthly amount 
revenue for these engagements can be recognized in monthly installments over the billable portion of the contract or on a time and materials basis 
installment amounts may be adjusted to reflect changes in staffing requirements or service level agreements 
costs of transitioning the employees and ensuring the company meets required service level agreements may be capitalized over defined periods of time 
in all consulting engagements  outsourcing engagements  and software application sales  the risk of issues associated with satisfactory service delivery exists 
although management believes these risks are adequately addressed by the company s adherence to proven project management methodologies  proprietary frameworks  and internal project audits  the potential exists for future revenue charges relating to service delivery issues 
allowance for bad debts each accounting period  keane evaluates accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of keane s services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue in the period the risk is identified 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if the company s evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  the company may incur future adjustments to revenue 
property and equipment the company periodically reviews its property and equipment for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  the company must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset  and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and was  therefore  required to perform an impairment test on its goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives during the first six months of  and then on a periodic basis thereafter 
the company s initial goodwill impairment analysis was completed during the second quarter of  and was based on january  balances 
through this analysis it was determined that there was no impairment as of that date 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment review based on september  balances and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 
future changes in estimates may result in a non cash goodwill impairment that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the company periodically reviews its identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
in determining whether an intangible asset is impaired  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if the estimates or the related assumptions used to determine the value of the intangible assets change  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes keane accounts for income taxes in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on prior taxable income and estimates of future taxable income  the company has determined that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
if actual taxable income varies from these estimates  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense which will be recorded in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation the company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the shares at the date of grant 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of fas  fas accounting for stock based compensation  and applies apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  to its grants of stock options and accordingly  recognizes no compensation expense for stock based employee compensation provided options are issued at the current market value 
the company also grants restricted stock for a fixed number of shares to employees for nominal consideration 
compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is recorded ratably over the restriction period 
restructuring keane has recorded restructuring charges and reserves associated with restructuring plans approved by management over the last four years 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and real estate lease obligations 
the reserve associated with lease obligations could be materially affected by factors such as the ability to obtain subleases  the creditworthiness of sub lessees  market value of properties  and the ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors 
while the company believes that its current estimates regarding lease obligations are adequate  future events could necessitate significant adjustments to these estimates 
future changes in estimates may result in adjustments to the company s consolidated financial statements

impact of inflation and changing prices inflationary increases in costs have not been material in recent years and  to the extent permitted by competitive pressures  are passed on to clients through increased billing rates 
rates charged by the company are based on the cost of labor and market conditions within the industry 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
keane s quarterly operating results have varied  and are likely to continue to vary significantly 
this may result in volatility in the market price of keane s shares 
keane has experienced and expects to continue to experience fluctuations in its quarterly results 
keane s gross margins vary based on a variety of factors including employee utilization rates and the number and type of services performed by keane during a particular period 
a variety of factors influence keane s revenue in a particular quarter  including general economic conditions which may influence investment decisions or cause downsizing  the number and requirements of client engagements  employee utilization rates  changes in the rates keane can charge clients for services  acquisitions  and other factors  many of which are beyond keane s control 
a significant portion of keane s expenses do not vary relative to revenue 
as a result  if revenue in a particular quarter does not meet expectations  keane s operating results could be materially adversely affected  which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the market price of keane common stock 
in addition  many of keane s engagements are terminable without client penalty 
an unanticipated termination of a major project could result in an increase in underutilized employees and a decrease in revenue and profits 
keane has pursued  and intends to continue to pursue  strategic acquisitions 
failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets may adversely affect keane s financial performance 
in the past five years  keane has grown significantly through acquisitions 
from january  through december   keane has completed eleven acquisitions 
the aggregate merger and consideration costs of these acquisitions totaled approximately million 
keane s future growth may be based in part on selected acquisitions 
at any given time  keane may be in various stages of considering acquisition opportunities 
keane can provide no assurances that it will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that it will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target 
in addition  even if keane reaches a definitive agreement with a target  there is no assurance that keane will complete any future acquisition 
keane typically anticipates that each acquisition will bring benefits  such as an increase in revenue 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if keane can realize these benefits 
accordingly  there is a risk that an acquired company may not achieve an increase in revenue or other benefits for keane 
in addition  an acquisition may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the process of integrating acquired companies into keane s existing business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which keane might otherwise devote to its existing business 
in addition  the process may require significant financial resources that keane might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of keane s existing operations 
finally  future acquisitions could result in keane having to incur additional debt and or contingent liabilities 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition  and result of operations 
keane may not realize the expected benefits or synergies of its acquisitions of metro and signaltree solutions 
although the integration of the operations and personnel of metro  which keane acquired in november  and signaltree solutions  inc  which keane acquired in march  are complete  keane may not achieve the anticipated benefits or synergies of each acquisition 
achieving the benefits of these acquisitions will depend in part on keane s ability to retain clients acquired through the mergers and cross sell services to these new clients and the ability of keane s sales organization to satisfactorily meet the needs of these new clients 
if keane is unable to retain metro and signaltree solutions clients or effectively cross sell to such clients  the combined company could suffer a loss of momentum in the activities of its business  which could have a material adverse effect on keane s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
keane faces significant competition for its services  and its failure to remain competitive could limit its ability to maintain existing clients or attract new clients 
the market for keane s services is highly competitive 
the technology for custom software services can change rapidly 
the market is fragmented  and no company holds a dominant position 
consequently  keane s competition for client assignments and experienced personnel varies significantly from city to city and by the type of service provided 
some of keane s competitors are larger and have greater technical  financial  and marketing resources and greater name recognition in the markets they serve than does keane 
in addition  clients may elect to increase their internal information systems resources to satisfy their custom software development and integration needs 
in the healthcare software systems market  keane competes with some companies that are larger in the healthcare market and have greater financial resources than keane 
keane believes that significant competitive factors in the healthcare software systems market include size and demonstrated ability to provide service to targeted healthcare markets 
keane may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures faced by keane may materially adversely affect its business  financial condition  and results of operations 
keane conducts business in the united kingdom  canada  and india  which exposes it to a number of difficulties inherent in international activities 
as a result of its acquisition of signaltree solutions in march  keane has two software development facilities in india and has added approximately technical professionals to its professional services organization 
india is currently experiencing conflicts with pakistan over the disputed territory of kashmir as well as clashes between different religious groups within the country 
these conflicts  in addition to other unpredictable developments in the political  economic  and social conditions in india  could eliminate or reduce the availability of these development and professional services 
if access to these services were to be unexpectedly eliminated or significantly reduced  keane s ability to meet development objectives important to its new strategy would be hindered  and its business could be harmed 
if keane fails to manage its geographically dispersed organization  it may fail to meet or exceed its financial objectives and its revenues may decline 
keane performs development activities in the united states  canada  and in india  and has offices throughout the united states  the united kingdom  canada  and india 
this geographic dispersion requires substantial management resources that locally based competitors do not need to devote to their operations 
keane s operations in the united kingdom  canada  and india are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  changes in taxation  and other difficulties in managing operations overseas 
keane may not be successful in its international operations 
keane may be unable to redeploy its professionals effectively if engagements are terminated unexpectedly  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
keane s clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with keane on short notice 
if they do so  keane may be unable to reassign its professionals to new engagements without delay 
the cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could  therefore  reduce the utilization rate of keane s professionals  which would have a negative impact on keane s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
keane believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and it expects that results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
keane s growth could be limited if it is unable to attract personnel in the information technology and business consulting industries 
keane believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
the competition for such personnel is intense 
keane may not succeed in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to develop its business 
if keane does not  its business  financial condition  and result of operations could be materially adversely affected
