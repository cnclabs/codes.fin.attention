this increase in net income was primarily the result of strong loan growth  maintaining strong asset quality and expense control and resulted in returns on average assets of   and and returns on average common shareholders equity of   and for the years ended  and  respectively 
return on average assets is calculated by dividing annualized net income by the daily average of total assets 
return on average common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income by the daily average of common shareholders equity 
results of operations net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest income  the principal source of the company s earnings  has declined as a percent of net revenues  defined as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income  due to growth in the company s fee income 
in  net interest income provided of the company s net revenues  compared with in and in interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income

the impact of the growth in average interest earning assets was partially offset by a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities  offset by a decrease in the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points to in for the year ended december   the net interest margin  defined as annualized net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  decreased to compared to for the prior year 
this decrease resulted from a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the current year 
this decrease in the yield on interest earning assets was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of funds of for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net interest margin risk is typically related to a narrowing of the yield on interest earning assets and cost of funds 
the company managed this risk with asset and liability pricing to minimize the impact of declining rates  lowering the average costs of deposits and adding interest rate floors to some of its loan agreements 
on november  the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate and discount rate by basis points 
due to the bank s asset sensitivity  the net interest margin decreased after this rate cut 
this resulted in net interest margins of and and net interest spreads of and for the years ended december  and  respectively

although no assurance can be given  management believes that the present allowance for loan losses is adequate considering loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
management regularly reviews the company s loan loss allowance in accordance with its standard procedures

the principal balances of mortgage loans sold were million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
mortgage servicing fees  net of amortization and impairment were million for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period last year 
this decrease is primarily due to a provision established for capitalized mortgage servicing rights in excess of fair value  net of recovery  in the amount of million during the decrease in the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights is a result of historically low mortgage rates resulting in an increase in prepayments of mortgages serviced by the company 
in addition  the company recorded million of payoff amortization in compared to million of payoff amortization in noninterest expenses for the year ended december   noninterest expenses totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million during  which had increased from million during the increase in noninterest expenses during these periods was due primarily to salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expenses by net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net security gains losses 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
the company s efficiency ratios were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in the efficiency ratio in is primarily a result of the decline in the net interest margin discussed in results of operations net interest income above 
the efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in management s evaluation of the company and is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles 
it may not be a comparable measurement among different financial institutions 
salaries and employee benefits expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  from the same period in these increases were due primarily to hiring additional personnel required to accommodate the company s growth 
total full time equivalent employees for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
occupancy expense rose million to million in major categories included within occupancy expense are depreciation expense and maintenance contract expense 
depreciation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to additional depreciation resulting from the purchase of the downtown operations center and capitalized leasehold improvements associated with renovations at the company s headquarters

this increase is primarily due to charge offs of deposit accounts related to a deposit product introduced in in addition  the company charged off  in related to check kiting 
income taxes income tax expense includes the regular federal income tax at the statutory rate  plus the income tax component of the texas franchise tax 
the amount of federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income  the amount of nondeductible interest expense  and the amount of other nondeductible expenses 
taxable income for the income tax component of the texas franchise tax is the federal pre tax income  plus certain officers salaries  less interest income from federal securities 
in income tax expense was million  an increase of million  or  from the million of income tax expense in which increased million  or  from the million of income tax expense in the company s effective tax rates were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reduced tax rate is primarily due to an increase in tax exempt income earned on the company s bank owned life insurance and other tax exempt securities 
impact of inflation the effects of inflation on the local economy and on the company s operating results have been relatively modest for the past several years 
since substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature  such as cash  securities  loans and deposits  their values are less sensitive to the effects of inflation than to changing interest rates  which do not necessarily change in accordance with inflation rates 
the company attempts to control the impact of interest rate fluctuations by managing the relationship between its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities

financial condition loans held for investment loans held for investment were billion at december   an increase of million  or from december  loans held for investment were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from billion at december  during the past five years loans have grown at an annualized rate of 
this growth is consistent with the company s strategy of targeting corporate middle market and private banking customers and providing innovative products with superior customer service 
this plan also includes establishing new branches in areas that demographically complement existing or targeted customer base  pursuing selected mergers acquisitions that will add new markets  delivery systems and talent to the company  and leveraging new or existing technology to improve the profitability of the company and its customers 
loans increased during as the company continued to expand its market presence in its defined primary market 
the company continues to take a conservative approach to credit underwriting  which it believes is a prudent course of action  especially in uncertain economic conditions 
while the short term outlook for economic conditions is unclear  the company is optimistic about the future and has continued to invest in new products  services  and personnel that it believes will bring excellent opportunities for growth and expansion 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in loans to commercial  real estate construction and land development enterprises  with the balance in residential and consumer loans 
while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  lending operations are located primarily in an eight county area in and around houston 
an economic recession over a prolonged period of time in the houston area could cause increases in nonperforming assets  thereby causing operating losses  impairing liquidity and eroding capital 
there can be no assurance that future adverse changes in the local economy would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the following table summarizes the loan portfolio of the company by major category as of the dates indicated december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial    real estate construction and land development    family residential    commercial owner occupied    farmland    other    consumer    total loans held for investment    december  amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands commercial and industrial   real estate construction and land development   family residential   commercial owner occupied   farmland   other   consumer   total loans held for investment   the primary lending focus of the company is on small and medium sized commercial  construction and land development  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the company offers a variety of commercial lending products including term loans  lines of credit and equipment financing 
a broad range of short to medium term commercial loans  both collateralized and uncollateralized  are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables  business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment and machinery 
the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure 
the company s commercial loans are generally underwritten on the basis of the borrower s ability to service such debt from cash flow 
as a general practice  the company takes as collateral a lien on any available real estate  equipment  or other assets and personal guarantees of company owners or project sponsors 
working capital loans are primarily collateralized by short term assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by long term assets 
a substantial portion of the company s real estate loans consists of loans collateralized by real estate  other assets and personal guarantees of company owners or project sponsors 
additionally  a portion of the company s lending activity consists of the origination of single family residential mortgage loans collateralized by owner occupied properties located in the company s primary market area 
the company offers a variety of mortgage loan products which generally are amortized over five to years 
loans collateralized by single family residential real estate are typically originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value 
the company typically requires mortgage title insurance and hazard insurance in the amount of the loan 
although the contractual loan payment periods for single family residential real estate loans are generally for a to year period  such loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms 
the company originates and purchases residential and commercial mortgage loans to sell to investors with servicing rights retained 
the company also provides residential and commercial construction financing to builders and developers and acts as a broker in the origination of multi family and commercial real estate loans 
residential construction financing to builders generally has been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value 
the company requires a mortgage title binder and builder s risk insurance in the amount of the loan 
the contractual loan payment periods for residential constructions loans are generally for a six to twelve month period 
consumer loans made by the company include automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  home improvement loans  personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateral ized loans 
the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan 
the contractual maturity ranges of the commercial and industrial and funded real estate construction and land development loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with fixed interest rates and floating interest rates in each maturity range as of december  are summarized in the following table december  after one one year or through after less five years five years total dollars in thousands commercial and industrial     real estate construction and land development     total     loans with a fixed interest rate     loans with a floating interest rate     total     loans held for sale loans held for sale of million at december  increased from million at december  these loans are carried at the lower of cost or market and are typically sold to investors within one year of origination 
the market value of these loans is impacted by changes in current interest rates 
an increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the market value of these loans while a decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the market value of these loans 
the business of originating and selling loans is conducted by the company s mortgage segment 
loan review and allowance for loan losses the company s loan review procedures include a credit quality assurance process that begins with approval of lending policies and underwriting guidelines by the board of directors  a loan review department staffed  in part  with office of the comptroller of the currency experienced personnel  low individual lending limits for officers  senior loan committee approval for large credit relationships and a quality control process for loan documentation 
the company also maintains a monitoring process for credit extensions in excess of  the company performs quarterly concentration analyses based on various factors such as industries  collateral types  business lines  large credit sizes  international credit exposure and officer portfolio loads 
the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers 
the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
the company continues to invest in its loan portfolio monitoring system to enhance its risk management capabilities 
the company s loan portfolio is well diversified by industry type but is generally concentrated in the eight county region defined as its primary market area 
historically  the houston metropolitan area has been affected both positively and negatively by conditions in the energy industry 
it is estimated that approximately of economic activity currently is related to the upstream energy industry  down from in since the mid s  the economic impact of changes in the energy industry has been lessened due to the diversification of the houston economy driven by growth in such economic entities as the texas medical center  the port of houston  the johnson space center  among others  and government infrastructure spending to support the population and job growth in the houston area 
as a result  the economy of the company s primary market area has become increasingly affected by changes in the national and international economies 
the company monitors changes in the level of energy prices  real estate values  borrower collateral  and the level of local  regional  national  and international economic activity 
recently  several major employers in the houston market have either experienced financial difficulties or reductions in employment due to changes in the energy trading markets  corporate consolidations  or political events affecting the global economy 
while these factors are significant  the company s primary market area has managed to show a month gain of approximately  jobs on an employment base estimated to be million as of december  as of december   other than million in charge offs related to four commercial credits  these events have had no material effect on the company s loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   net charge offs to average loans was 
the average for all fdic insured banks was for the nine months ended september  there can be no assurance  however  the company s loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to changes in general economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly analysis of the allowance for loan losses to a committee of the board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making its evaluations  management considers both quantitative and qualitative risk factors in establishing an allowance for loan losses that it considers to be appropriate at each reporting period 
quantitative factors include historical charge off experience  delinquency and past due trends  changes in collateral values  changes in energy prices  changes in the level of borrower covenant violations  the level of nonperforming loans  changes in the risk classification of credits  growth and concentrations of credit in the loan portfolio  the results of regulatory and internal loan review examinations  and changes in the loan portfolio s composition by both industry and by borrower 
qualitative factors include an evaluation of the economic factors affecting the company s primary market area  changes in the type and complexity of credit extensions  the experience levels of its lending and loan review staff  new lending products  the age of the loan portfolio  and other factors 
in order to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs periodic reviews of the loan portfolio  either individually or in pools 
generally  commercial and real estate loans are reviewed individually and consumer and single family residential loans are evaluated in pools 
a general allowance for loan losses is established based upon i the historical loss experience by loan type  ii management s internal grading of the loans resulting in an allowance based upon the historical loss experience by grade applied to the outstanding principal balance of the adversely graded loans  and iii certain subjective factors such as economic trends  performance trends  portfolio age and concentrations of credit 
in addition  specific allowances may be established for loans which management believes require greater reserves than those allocated based on the above methodology 
future changes in economic conditions  circumstances  or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as necessary 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of such date 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  the following table presents  for the periods indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses  beginning balance      provision charged against operations      charge offs commercial and industrial   real estate construction and land development family residential commercial owner occupied farmland other consumer    total charge offs      recoveries commercial and industrial real estate construction and land development family residential commercial owner occupied farmland other consumer total recoveries net charge offs      adjustment to conform reporting periods adjustment for sale of subsidiary allowance for loan losses  ending balance      allowance to period end loans net charge offs to average loans allowance to period end nonperforming loans the following table reflects the distribution of the allowance for loan losses among various categories of loans for the dates indicated

loans are designated as nonaccrual when reasonable doubt exists as to the full collection of interest and principal 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of interest and principal is probable 
interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when  in the judgment of management  the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest 
gross interest income on nonaccrual loans that would have been recorded had these loans been performing as agreed was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company regularly updates appraisals on loans collateralized by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible writedowns or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if management believes that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a loan is not considered impaired during a period of delay in payment if the company expects to collect all amounts due  including interest past due 
an insignificant delay up to days or insignificant shortfall in the amount of payment does not constitute an impairment 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  an impairment is recognized through the provision for loan losses 
all nonaccrual loans and accruing loans or more days past due are considered impaired at december  the following is a summary of loans considered to be impaired december  dollars in thousands impaired loans with no valuation allowance impaired loans with a valuation allowance   total recorded investment in impaired loans   valuation allowance related to impaired loans   the average recorded investment in impaired loans during   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest income on impaired loans of   and million was recognized for cash payments received in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the valuation allowance related to impaired loans is the result of a change in the composition of these loans and charge offs recorded in securities at the date of purchase  the company classifies debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at each reporting date  the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed 
investments in debt securities classified as held to maturity are stated at cost  increased by accretion of discounts and reduced by amortization of premiums  both computed by the interest method  only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading are classified as available for sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized 
gains and losses on sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
the company has classified all securities as available for sale at december  the amortized cost of securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity is as follows december  dollars in thousands available for sale us government and agency securities      mortgage backed securities      municipal securities      federal reserve bank stock      federal home loan bank stock      other securities      total securities available for sale      held to maturity us government us   mortgage backed securities   municipal securities   other securities  total securities held to maturity   the amortized cost and approximate fair value of securities classified as available for sale is as follows december  december  gross gross unrealized unrealized amortized fair amortized fair cost gain loss value cost gain loss value dollars in thousands available for sale us government and agency securities       mortgage backed securities         municipal securities       federal reserve bank stock     federal home loan bank stock     other securities     total securities available for sale         december  gross unrealized amortized fair cost gain loss value dollars in thousands available for sale us government and agency securities    mortgage backed securities     municipal securities   federal reserve bank stock   federal home loan bank stock   other securities   total securities available for sale     in connection with the citizens merger  the company transferred all of citizens held to maturity debt securities to the available for sale category in the amortized cost of these securities at the time of transfer was million and the unrealized gain was   net of income taxes

at december   approximately million of the company s mortgage backed securities earned interest at floating rates and repriced within one year and  accordingly  were less susceptible to declines in value should interest rates increase 
the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investments and their weighted average yields at december  the yield on the securities portfolio is based on average historical cost balances and does not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a separate component of other comprehensive income

factored receivables result from providing operating funds to businesses by converting their accounts receivable to cash 
during  factored receivables decreased million to million 
this decrease was due to unusual customer cash needs at december  that were not experienced in deposits the company offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the company s deposits consist of demand  savings  interest bearing demand  money market and time accounts 
the company relies primarily on its product and service offerings  high quality customer service  advertising  and competitive pricing policies to attract and retain these deposits 
deposits provide the primary source of funding for the company s lending and investment activities  and the interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense 
the company had million and  of its deposits classified as brokered funds at december  and  respectively 
the growth in brokered deposits is attributable to a major new treasury management relationship whereby the bank provides banking and treasury management services to mortgage companies throughout the united states 
under this relationship  a referring source  whose business is to lend money to mortgage companies  introduces its customers to the bank 
deposits garnered as a result of those introductions are classified as brokered deposits for financial and regulatory reporting purposes 
in spite of this classification  management believes that the deposits in question are core and relationship in nature and that they do not have the characteristics or risks normally associated with brokered deposits

short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and other bank borrowings 
the company s long term borrowings generally consist of borrowings with the federal home loan bank maturing within one year 
information relating to these borrowings for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows december  dollars in thousands securities sold under repurchase agreements average   period end   maximum month end balance during period   interest rate weighted average for the period weighted average at period end long term borrowings average   period end   maximum month end balance during period   interest rate weighted average for the period weighted average at period end short term borrowings average   period end   maximum month end balance during period   interest rate weighted average for the period weighted average at period end interest rate sensitivity asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets as compared to liabilities 
it is the objective of the company to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company adjusts its interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities and may use interest rate products such as interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the company s asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee the alco  which is composed of senior officers of the bank and two outside directors  in accordance with policies approved by the bank s board of directors 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of the bank s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to the bank s overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews the bank s liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  retail and institutional deposit activity  current market conditions  and interest rates on both a local and national level 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the company uses simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends  and strategies 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the company s net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
the data used to prepare the table is as of december   which may not be representative of average balances found at year end or any other time period 
the analysis is a tool used by management that changes every month based on changes in the composition of the balance sheet 
management believes that  based on available information  the bank has been and will continue to be slightly asset sensitive 
the interest rate scenarios presented in the table include interest rates at december  and and as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on the company 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the twelve month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that the company might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on the company 
changes in interest rates impact on net interest income december  december  impact on market value of portfolio equity december  december  the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
while the gap is a useful measurement and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates solely on that measure 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the company s one year cumulative gap position at december  was a positive million or of assets 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not indicative of the company s position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
the following table sets forth an interest rate sensitivity analysis for the company as of december  one to after days days three years three years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets money market funds   securities      loans      federal funds sold   total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities demand  money market and savings deposits      certificates of deposit and other time deposits      short term borrowings   long term borrowings    total interest bearing liabilities      period gap      cumulative gap     period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors  and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets  and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year  and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
the company relies primarily on customer deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements and shareholders equity to fund interest earning assets 
the federal home loan bank fhlb is also a major source of liquidity for the bank 
the fhlb allows member banks to borrow against their eligible collateral to satisfy liquidity requirements 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  competitively pricing deposit products  and extending the contractual maturity of liabilities  reduces the company s exposure to roll over risk on deposits and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits that provide a sizable source of relatively stable and low cost funds 
core deposits include all deposits  except certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  and over 
average core deposits funded approximately of total interest earning assets for the year ended december  and for the same period in management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor  and creditor needs in the present economic environment 
in addition  the bank has access to the fhlb for borrowing purposes 
the company has not received any recommendations from regulatory authorities that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or operations 
subject to certain limitations  the bank may borrow funds from the fhlb in the form of advances 
credit availability from the fhlb to the bank is based on the bank s financial and operating condition 
borrowings from the fhlb to the bank were approximately million at december  in addition to creditworthiness  the bank must own a minimum amount of fhlb capital stock 
this minimum is of outstanding fhlb advances 
unused borrowing capacity at december  was approximately million 
the bank uses fhlb advances for both long term and short term liquidity needs 
other than normal banking operations  the bank has no long term liquidity needs 
the bank has never been involved with highly leveraged transactions that may cause unusual potential long term liquidity needs

critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management utilizes historical experience as well as other factors including the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values  the effect on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers and increases or decreases in nonperforming and impaired loans 
changes in these factors may cause management s estimate of the allowance to increase or decrease and result in adjustments to the company s provision for loan losses 
see financial condition loan review and allowance for loan losses and note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies for a detailed description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights assets are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about loan repayment rates  credit loss experience  and costs to service  as well as discount rates that consider the risk involved 
because the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is considered a critical accounting estimate 
see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies and note mortgage servicing rights for further discussion on the accounting for these assets

capital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations 
the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the occ 
both the federal reserve board and the occ have adopted risk based capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy 
these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and off balance sheet exposure  adjusted for credit risk 
the risk based capital standards currently in effect are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among bank holding companies and banks  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate relative risk weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
bank regulatory authorities in the united states have issued risk based capital standards by which all bank holding companies and banks are evaluated in terms of capital adequacy 
the risk based capital standards issued by the federal reserve board apply to the company  and the occ guidelines apply to the bank 
these guidelines relate a financial institution s capital to the risk profile of its assets 
the risk based capital standards require all financial organizations to have tier capital of at least of risk adjusted assets and total risk based capital tier and tier of at least of risk adjusted assets 
tier capital includes  generally  common shareholders equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interest in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less deductions for goodwill and various other intangibles 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  certain hybrid capital instruments and other debt securities  preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  and a limited amount of the general valuation allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the agencies have also adopted guidelines which supplement the risk based capital guidelines with a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets leverage ratio of for institutions with well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings  and that are generally considered to be strong banking organizations  rated composite under applicable federal guidelines  and that are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth 
other banking organizations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to 
these rules further provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels and comparable to peer group averages  without significant reliance on intangible assets

also pursuant to fdicia  each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution would be considered well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized

management may use derivative contracts to manage its exposure to commitments to originate mortgage loans 
all of the derivatives utilized by the company are for purposes other than trading 
the derivatives utilized consist of purchased options on fnma or fhlmc guaranteed mortgage backed securities and forward delivery commitments with fnma and other secondary market investors 
these financial instruments are used to reduce the company s exposure to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on the company s lending and secondary marketing activities 
the notional amount and fair value of such derivatives was immaterial at december  and interest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates 
this risk is addressed by the company s alco  which includes senior management and board of director representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
the alco manages the company s balance sheet in part to minimize the potential impact on net portfolio value and net interest income despite changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in net portfolio value in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
if potential changes to net portfolio value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest rate changes are not within the limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company has implemented strategies to more closely match its balance sheet composition 
interest rate sensitivity is computed by estimating the changes in net portfolio of equity value  or market value over a range of potential changes in interest rates 
the market value of equity is the market value of the company s assets minus the market value of its liabilities plus the market value of any off balance sheet items 
the market value of each asset  liability  and off balance sheet item is its net present value of expected cash flows discounted at market rates after adjustment for rate changes 
the company measures the impact on market value for an immediate and sustained basis point increase and decrease shock in interest rates
