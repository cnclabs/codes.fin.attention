sales of urethane products were up slightly year over year 
operating profit in fiscal for the elastomerics segment decreased million from million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the decrease resulted principally from lower sales volumes  prices and margins on roofing products

jps glass net sales in the glass segment  which includes substrates constructed of synthetics and fiberglass for lamination  insulation and filtration applications  decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the significant decline in demand for electronics related substrates 
the electronics industry represents the largest customer base for the company s fiberglass products and dramatic demand decreases were only partly offset by higher sales of filtration  quartz and other industrial substrates 
operating profit in fiscal for the glass segment decreased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal lower unit sales and prices of electronic substrates combined with higher insurance and manufacturing costs to account for the majority of the operation profit reduction  more than offsetting the contribution from higher sales of filtration  quartz and industrial substrates

other interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total long term debt was reduced by approximately million in fiscal as a result of cash flow from operations and payment received on the sale of the company s apparel division 
the company has also benefited from interest rate reductions 
on november  the company sold the assets of its greige apparel fabric business  which included three manufacturing facilities in south boston  virginia  greenville  south carolina  and laurens  south carolina  and administrative offices in greenville  south carolina  new york and los angeles  thereby exiting its apparel business 
the business accounted for sales of million in fiscal the consideration for the sale consisted of approximately million in cash and future consideration in the form of an earn out based on earnings before interest  depreciation and amortization  as defined  for the month period following the transaction plus certain assumed liabilities 
the company has accounted for the results of the apparel fabric business as a discontinued operation and a charge for loss on disposal of discontinued operations of million was recorded in fiscal related primarily to the writedown of disposed plant assets and related reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets  and other exit costs 
the net proceeds from the sale of million were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness on its revolving credit facility which was amended in connection with the transaction to reflect the company s lower borrowing requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity for operations and expansion are funds generated internally and borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility is with wachovia bank 
on april   the company amended the revolving credit facility to increase its flexibility and reduce the unused line fee 
the facility  as amended  provides for a revolving credit loan facility and letters of credit in a maximum principal amount equal to the lesser of a million or b a specified borrowing base  which is based upon eligible receivables  eligible inventory  and a specified dollar amount currently million subject to amortization 
the revolving credit facility restricts investments  acquisitions  and dividends

in  the company received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of its apparel division as discussed above under the caption fiscal compared with fiscal 
such funds were used to reduce the company s outstanding indebtedness under its revolving credit facility and certain equipment loans 
based upon the ability to generate working capital through its operations and its new revolving credit facility the company believes that it has the financial resources necessary to pay its capital obligations and implement its business plan 
inflation and tax matters the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
it has historically been able to pass along inflationary increases in its costs by increasing the prices for its products or by increasing manufacturing efficiencies  however  market conditions have precluded raising prices in and and  in some cases  the company experienced selling price decreases for its products 
for fiscal  the company recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of million  a effective rate 
the company had net operating loss carryovers of approximately million as of november  a portion of these losses are subject to annual limitations on usage as a result of the ownership change that occurred as determined under the internal revenue code of see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the effective rates for all years are higher than the combined federal and state statutory rate due to the impact of nondeductible costs 
for  these costs are primarily travel costs  for and  the nondeductible costs were primarily excess reorganization costs 
although the deferred tax asset reflected in the financial statements would not be realized should the company continue to have losses as in fiscal  the company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized utilizing future income 
such realization requires that the company generate on average approximately  of pre tax income increasing at approximately per year 
the company believes that such minimum level of income will be obtained through certain cost reductions as well as improvements in profitability resulting from increased sales 
in addition  the company believes that historical operations clearly support the ability of current operations to generate the income needed to realize this asset 
the ability of the company to utilize net operating loss carryforwards  which contribute to its deferred tax asset  is enhanced by the fact that net operating loss carryforwards sufficient to utilize the entire deferred tax asset do not expire until the fiscal year ending critical accounting policies and other matters the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to inventories  the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for self insurance liabilities  the reserve for roofing products sold under warranties  income taxes  pension and other post retirement benefits and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of operations and financial condition  as well as in the notes to the financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect the company s reported and expected results 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time ownership of goods transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no

guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company has exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to interest rate changes under its revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility bears interest at rates which vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
the company does not speculate on the future direction of interest rates 
currently  all of the company s debt bears interest at the day libor rate plus an applicable margin based upon the company s debt to ebitda ratio 
the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would not be material 
raw material price risk 
a portion of the company s raw materials are commodities and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties  and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
in most cases  essential raw materials are available from several sources 
for several raw materials  however  branded goods or other circumstances may prevent such diversification and an interruption of the supply of these raw materials could have a significant impact on the company s ability to produce certain products 
the company has established long term relationships with key suppliers and may enter into purchase contracts or commitments of one year or less for certain raw materials 
such agreements generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the contract or commitment 
the company believes that any changes in raw material pricing  which cannot be adjusted for by changes in its product pricing or other strategies  would not be significant 
general economic conditions 
demand for the company s products is affected by a variety of economic factors including  but not limited to  the cyclical nature of the construction industry  demand for electronic and aerospace products that ultimately utilize components manufactured by the company  and general consumer demand 
adverse economic developments could affect the financial performance of the company  and these factors include  but are not limited to  the general economic and business conditions affecting the company s industries  actions of competitors  changes in demand in certain markets  the company s ability to meet its debt service and pension plan obligations  the seasonality of the company s sales  the volatility of the company s raw material costs  claims and energy  and the company s dependence on key personnel and certain large customers
