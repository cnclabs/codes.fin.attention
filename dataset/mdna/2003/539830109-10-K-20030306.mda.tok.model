item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations lockheed martin corporation december  industry considerations defense business considerations in recent years  domestic and worldwide political and economic developments have had a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems  products and services 
markets for defense and advanced technology systems during and in the foreseeable future will continue to be affected by the worldwide war against terrorism and threats created by the potential widespread availability of weapons of mass destruction 
these realities have increased the need for greater attention to the security of our homeland and for better communication and interplay between law enforcement  civil government agencies and our military services 
our nation s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more capabilities based structure  which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility  stronger space capabilities  better missile defense and improved information systems security 
the president s budget for the us department of defense dod for fiscal year and beyond reflects the transformation of the country s national defense posture and responds to increased needs for homeland security and defeating terrorism 
this is evidenced by budget increases for operational readiness and personnel needs  as well as for both procurement and research and development 
while there is no assurance that the increased dod budget levels will be approved by congress  the current defense budget outlook is one of modest growth 
however  the level of growth and the amount of the budget that will ultimately be allocated to the investment accounts ie  procurement  research and development is unknown 
our broad mix of programs and capabilities gives us the ability to support the needs of the various agencies of the us government that require our products and services 
our product areas and programs include missile defense  space intelligence  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr  air mobility aircraft  and air power projection precision strike capability 
in terms of size and long term potential impact  two of our more important programs are the f a fighter aircraft program and the f joint strike fighter program 
we are also represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the pac and thaad programs 
in the areas of space intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on the milstar  advanced extremely high frequency aehf and space based infrared system high sbirs h programs  and in battle management command and control capabilities 
in airlift  we have the c j program and are under contract to upgrade the c strategic airlift aircraft 
many of these programs are large and require funding over several budget cycles 
there are risks associated with these and other large  highly visible programs that are subject to appropriation by congress which  because of their size  could be expected to become potential targets for reductions or extensions of their funding to pay for other programs 
in addition  the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  information systems security and other technical systems solutions 
recent trends have indicated an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems 
this is an area where we have continued to focus our resources 
in prior years  companies in our industry had reacted to historically shrinking defense budgets for procurement  research and development by combining to maintain critical mass and achieve cost savings 
more recently  we have focused our efforts on cost savings and improving efficiency  as well as generating cash to repay debt incurred during the period of consolidation 
through our consolidation activities  we have been able to pass along savings to our customers  mainly the dod 
non us defense budgets have generally been declining over the past decade 
as a result  consolidation has also been occurring in the european aerospace industry  resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors  potentially resulting in an environment where there could be less demand abroad for products from us companies 
this type of environment could reduce opportunities for european partnerships and sales potential for us exports 
other business considerations as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we do not believe that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
changes in government procurement policies and practices over the past several years  such as increases in the progress payment rate and the use of performance based payments  have had a positive effect on our financial position and cash flows 
but we are still exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties and obsolescence  and having to depend on congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost overruns and failures can occur 
in addition to our defense businesses  we also provide products and services to civil government customers  as well as commercial customers 
relative to civil government customers  in  a joint venture in which we are participating was awarded the contract for deepwater  a modernization program for the coast guard s fleet and systems 
our role will be to provide systems integration and engineering  cisr  air assets  and integrated logistics support 
in addition  we provide products and services to agencies such as the us postal service  the federal aviation administration  nasa and the transportation security administration 
although our lines of business in civil government and commercial markets are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses  as well as other risks unique to their particular marketplaces 
these risks may include development of competing products  technological feasibility and product obsolescence 
with respect to our work with nasa  we provide products and services for the space shuttle program mainly through our space systems and technology services business segments 
in  work for nasa accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  of which approximately one half was related to the space shuttle program 
we also have a equity interest in united space alliance  llc  which provides ground processing and other operational services to the space shuttle program 
we are working with the columbia accident investigation board and nasa in the investigation of the february accident involving the space shuttle columbia 
this tragic event did not impact our results of operations for  and it is too early to determine whether the accident will affect our business operations for and beyond 
we have entered into various joint venture  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in commercial space as well as other lines of business 
for additional information about these ventures  see the discussion in the next section concerning our commercial space business  the discussion on page captioned write off and restructuring of investment in astrolink  and the discussion on page relating to space imaging under the caption capital structure and resources 
these arrangements generally include a formal plan for funding the business which usually requires commitments from the partners  and may require the business to get financing from other sources as well 
to the extent the business is unable to get financing from other sources  the business partners  ourselves included  would be required to look at alternatives for funding the business 
some of these business arrangements include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
commercial space business the launch vehicle industry has continued to be affected by low demand for products and services due mainly to low demand for satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
concerns over uncertainty in the economy have made it difficult for many ventures  especially telecommunications and other high technology companies  to obtain funding from capital markets 
reduced demand and increased competition have also caused pricing pressures in the launch vehicle market 
this comes at a time when we have been making significant investments in the evolved expendable launch vehicle atlas v program  our next generation launch vehicle 
this program has required investment of funds for research and development  start up and other nonrecurring costs  and launch facilities 
some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the us government 
we had our first atlas v launch in august  successfully delivering a eutelsat satellite into orbit 
orders to date for the atlas v launch vehicle have been lower than expected and at lower prices 
similar to the launch vehicle market  the commercial satellite market is experiencing pricing pressures due to excess capacity and lower demand 
satellite demand also has been impacted by the business difficulties encountered by some companies in the commercial satellite services industry which have resulted in reduced access to capital and a reduction in the total market size in the near term 
we expect to continue to reduce costs in our commercial satellite manufacturing business while keeping our focus on providing a reliable product 
in  we entered into a joint venture with two russian government owned space firms to form lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei 
we own of lkei 
lkei has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton family of rockets from a launch site in kazakhstan 
in  another joint venture was formed  international launch services ils  with lockheed martin and lkei each holding a ownership 
ils was formed to market commercial atlas and proton launch services around the world 
we consolidate the results of operations of lkei and ils into our financial statements 
contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer before the launch 
at the end of  million of advances received from customers for proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability on our balance sheet in the caption customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
a sizable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for proton launch services are sent to khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev  the manufacturer of the launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in russia 
if a contracted launch service is not provided  a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer 
in addition  we have sent advances to khrunichev for launches we purchased which have not yet been assigned to customers 
the advances sent to khrunichev are included on our balance sheet in inventories 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement with khrunichev to eliminate the requirement to provide launch services for our prior advances that were not associated with specific customer launch orders in exchange for an arrangement to reduce future launch payments from us to khrunichev  contingent on the receipt of new orders as well as a minimum number of actual launches each year 
due to the continuing overcapacity in the launch vehicle market  we do not expect to recover amounts previously advanced for an extended period of time 
in addition  we assessed the likelihood of customer terminations for convenience for launches currently under contract 
a contract termination would require khrunichev to refund a portion of the advances we have made to them and would require us to refund a portion of the advances received from the customer 
as a result of these factors  we reduced the carrying value of our advances to khrunichev and recognized a charge  net of state income tax benefits  of million in the fourth quarter of the charge reduced net earnings by million per share 
at year end  million of payments to khrunichev were included in inventories 
our ability to realize the remaining amounts may be affected by khrunichev s ability to provide the launch services and the political environment in russia 
through the end of  launch services through lkei and ils have been provided according to contract terms 
the corporation has entered into an agreement with rd amross  a joint venture of the pratt whitney division of united technologies corporation and the russian firm npo energomash  for the development and purchase  subject to certain conditions  of rd booster engines for use in the corporation s atlas launch vehicles 
terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to rd amross upon the achievement of certain milestones in the development and manufacturing processes 
approximately million of payments made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the corporation s inventories at december  critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition a large part of our business is derived from long term development and production contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing revenue 
for certain other long term fixed price contracts which  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  revenues are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method of accounting 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting versus when we use the units of delivery method 
we have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long term contracts 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
estimates of award fees are also a significant factor in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards 
products and services provided under long term development and production contracts make up a large portion of our business  and therefore the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
we follow us government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel perform reviews of the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
post retirement benefit plans most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with income or expense for qualified defined benefit plans pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
we account for our pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions fas 
those rules require that the amounts we record  including the income or expense for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year end assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the following fiscal year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
we use judgment in selecting these assumptions each year because we have to consider not only current market conditions  but also make judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
an actual example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in based on our review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets  and other factors  we lowered the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our year end actuarial calculations to  versus for this rate is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which results in an amount that is included in pension income or expense in the following year 
we also lowered the discount rate assumption to at year end  versus used for these changes  together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets  result in our projecting a substantial amount of pension expense for  compared to recording pension income in also  at the end of  we recorded an adjustment in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for most of our pension plans 
this adjustment is calculated on a plan by plan basis  and is determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation abo for the plan to the fair value of that plan s assets 
the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets  after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan  must be recorded as a minimum pension liability  with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset  if appropriate  and a reduction to stockholders equity  consistent with fas the noncash after tax adjustment related to our recording of a minimum pension liability in did not impact earnings  but reduced our stockholders equity by billion 
this adjustment is computed at each year end and could potentially reverse in the future if financial markets improve and interest rates increase  or could potentially increase if financial market performance and interest rates continue to decline 
the total funding requirement for our pension plans under us government cost accounting standards cas in was million 
cas is a major factor in determining our funding requirements and governs the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
for  we expect our funding requirements under cas to increase substantially 
this amount is recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore is recognized in our net sales 
also in  funding in addition to the amount calculated under cas will likely be required under internal revenue code rules 
any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules  and therefore are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
impairment of investments in equity securities we have investments in equity securities of several companies  some of which are publicly traded entities 
we review these investments each quarter to evaluate our ability to recover our investments 
we record an impairment charge if the fair value of the investment has declined below our carrying value  and that decline is viewed to be other than temporary 
for publicly traded companies  the fair value of the equity securities is determined by multiplying the number of shares we own by the stock price  as well as by computing estimates of the fair values based on a variety of valuation methods eg  discounted cash flow analyses  sum of the parts valuations and trading multiples 
for those companies that are not publicly traded  we prepare discounted cash flow analyses to compute an estimate of the fair value of the investment 
since we generally do not have access to internal projections of those companies  we prepare projections based on information that is publicly available 
we use judgment in computing the fair value based on our evaluation of the investee and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions  we consider the investee s ability to execute their business plan successfully  including their ability to obtain required funding  general market conditions  and industry considerations specific to their business 
it is likely that we could compute a materially different fair value for an investment if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
many of our investments are concentrated in the satellite services and telecommunications industries  including intelsat  ltd 
intelsat  inmarsat ventures plc inmarsat and new skies satellites  nv new skies 
these industries continue to be affected by the capital markets  excess satellite capacity and competition from other kinds of telecommunications services  including fiber optic cable and other wireless communication technologies 
this has been evidenced by recent bankruptcy filings by some telecommunications companies 
intelsat  inmarsat and new skies are also subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc 
fcc decisions and policies have had  and may continue to have  a significant impact on these companies 
in  congress passed the open market reorganization for the betterment of international telecommunications act the orbit act that  among other things  established deadlines for intelsat and inmarsat to complete their initial public offerings 
under the orbit act  intelsat and inmarsat were required to complete their initial public offerings by december  however  inmarsat has received an extension from the fcc until june  in october  legislation was enacted which extends the deadline for intelsat to complete its initial public offering to december   or june  if approved by the fcc 
unless there are changes in the current trends and market conditions in the telecommunications industry  as well as in the capital markets  intelsat and inmarsat may have difficulty in completing their initial public offerings by the orbit act deadlines 
if those deadlines are not met or extended by further amendments to the legislation  the fcc may limit access by us users to the satellite capacity of the privatized entities for some services 
if this were to occur  the value of our investments could be adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter  as part of the ongoing evaluation of our ability to recover our investments  we calculated an estimate of the current fair values of our investments in intelsat and inmarsat 
for our investment in new skies  we calculated the current fair value based on the publicly traded stock price and  for analysis purposes  also calculated an estimate of the fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
in each case  the fair value of our investment was less than our carrying amount 
we then made an assessment as to whether the decline in the value of these investments was other than temporary 
we reviewed investment analyst reports to the extent they were available 
we also assessed future business prospects for the companies and reviewed information regarding market and industry trends for their businesses 
based on our evaluation  including the factors discussed above  we determined that the decline in values of these investments was other than temporary  and recorded impairment charges related to these investments in the fourth quarter of the impact of the unusual charges on operating profit earnings from continuing operations before interest and taxes  net earnings and diluted earnings per share was as follows in millions operating profit net earnings earnings per diluted share write down of investment in intelsat inmarsat new skies total write down of telecommunications investments environmental liabilities we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note to the financial statements 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to  along with other factors  difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  and agreements between potentially responsible parties prps to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent of our obligation 
these agreements usually cover several years which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due  for example  to changing remediation technologies 
to determine total costs at clean up sites  we have to assess the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  as well as continually evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remedial actions 
given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur as described above  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
under agreements reached with the us government in and  some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government businesses  after deducting any recoveries from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
at the end of and  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million and million  respectively 
we have recorded an asset for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for us government businesses 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are pursuing as required by agreement and us government regulation 
any recoveries we receive would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future us government sales and cost of sales 
exit from the global telecommunications services business in december  we announced that we would exit our global telecommunications services business as a result of continuing overcapacity in the telecommunications industry and weakening business and economic conditions in latin america 
we also decided in the fourth quarter of not to provide further funding to astrolink international  llc astrolink and  mainly due to astrolink s inability to obtain additional funding from other sources  wrote off our investment in astrolink 
we recorded unusual charges  net of state income tax benefits  of approximately billion in the fourth quarter of related to these actions 
the charges reduced net earnings by about billion per diluted share 
the global telecommunications services businesses included the operations of comsat corporation 
we completed our merger with comsat corporation in august the operations of comsat were included in the results of our operations since august  the total purchase price for comsat was approximately billion 
the comsat transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  where the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
these allocations included adjustments totaling approximately billion to record investments in equity securities ie  intelsat  inmarsat and new skies at fair value  and goodwill 
the global telecommunications businesses that we retained included the systems technology line of business and the comsat general telecommunications business unit  which were realigned with the space systems segment  and enterprise solutions us  which was realigned with the technology services segment 
the equity investments retained  including intelsat  inmarsat and new skies  aces international  ltd 
aces  americom asia pacific  llc and astrolink  had a combined carrying value of about million at december  the following discussion describes the components of the billion in charges based on their classification in our financial statements 
discontinued operations the billion in charges in included an amount  net of state income tax benefits  of approximately billion related to global telecommunications services businesses held for sale and exit costs for the elimination of the administrative function supporting the global telecommunications businesses and investments 
these charges  which reduced net earnings for the year by billion per diluted share were included in discontinued operations in our statement of operations 
the status of the businesses held for sale is as follows satellite services businesses in  we completed the sale of comsat mobile communications and comsat world systems 
these transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we also reached an agreement to sell lockheed martin intersputnik lmi in the third quarter of this transaction is expected to close in  subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other conditions  including a requirement that we move the lmi satellite to another orbital slot 
the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
comsat international in  we completed the sale of an ownership interest in comsat international 
the transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
of the billion of charges included in discontinued operations  about billion related to impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill was recorded when we acquired comsat as discussed above 
approximately million of the billion related to impairment of some of the long lived assets employed by foreign businesses held for sale  mainly comsat international 
the rest of the charge related to costs associated with elimination of administrative functions  including severance and facilities 
effective january   we adopted fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
since the operating businesses we identified for divestiture met the requirements of fas to be classified as discontinued operations  their results of operations  as well as the impairment and other charges related to the decision to exit the businesses  are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented  and have been excluded from business segment information 
also  the assets and liabilities of these businesses have been shown separately in the balance sheet as being held for sale 
depreciation and amortization expense were not recorded for these businesses after the date they were classified as held for sale consistent with fas lmi is recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell at december  changes in the estimated fair value of lmi will be recorded in the future if appropriate 
we also completed the sale of lockheed martin ims corporation ims  a wholly owned subsidiary  for million in cash in august this transaction resulted in a gain  net of state income taxes  of million and increased net earnings by million per diluted share 
the results of ims s operations for all periods presented  as well as the gain on the sale  are classified as discontinued operations in accordance with fas net sales recorded in up to the effective date of the divestiture totaled approximately million  excluding intercompany sales 
the transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately million after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
other charges related to global telecommunications the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of also included unusual charges  net of state income tax benefits  of approximately million related to commitments to and impairment in the values of investments in satellite joint ventures  primarily aces and americom asia pacific 
we had previously recorded unusual charges related to other than temporary declines in the values of these investments as follows in the first quarter of  a charge  net of state income tax benefits  of million was recorded related to americom asia pacific  and in the fourth quarter of  a charge  net of state income tax benefits  of million was recorded related to aces see note to the financial statements for more discussion of these charges 
in addition  as part of the billion in charges recorded in the fourth quarter  about million related to severance  facilities costs and impairment of certain fixed assets associated with the business units we retained 
these unusual charges reduced net earnings for by million per diluted share 
write off and restructuring of investment in astrolink through  we had invested million in astrolink  a joint venture that planned to develop a broad band satellite system 
in the fourth quarter of  in light of market conditions affecting the telecommunications industry and the difficulty astrolink was having raising external capital  we decided not to make an additional equity investment in astrolink and wrote off our equity interest 
as a result  we recorded an unusual charge of million  net of state income tax benefits  in other income and expenses to reflect the other than temporary decline in the value of our astrolink investment 
we also recorded charges of approximately million  net of state income tax benefits  in cost of sales for certain other costs related to astrolink 
on a combined basis  these charges reduced net earnings for by approximately million per diluted share 
after several months of negotiation  in january  we finalized an agreement with astrolink s other members to restructure astrolink 
as part of the transaction  liberty satellite technology  a subsidiary of liberty media corporation  may acquire substantially all of astrolink s assets and pursue a business plan to build a one or two satellite system 
the transaction is subject to regulatory approval  financing and other closing conditions 
upon closing of the asset transfer  we would continue to provide launch services and be a satellite vendor  but would retain only a limited indirect equity interest in the restructured business 
the restructuring also entails the settlement of existing claims related to termination of astrolink s major procurement contracts 
as part of that settlement  if liberty satellite technology does not elect to proceed with the new system  we would acquire the remaining assets of astrolink  including work in process under our procurement contracts with astrolink 
certain other of the members also would retain their work in process 
under either scenario  the restructuring is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other divestiture activities in january  we completed the divestiture of two business units in the environmental management line of business 
the impact of these divestitures was not material to our results of operations  cash flows or financial position due to the effects of unusual impairment losses recorded in prior years related to these business units 
those losses were included in other income and expenses as part of other portfolio shaping activities in the respective years 
in november  we sold our aerospace electronics systems aes businesses for billion in cash the aes transaction 
we recorded an unusual loss  including state income taxes  of million related to this transaction which is included in other income and expenses 
the loss reduced net earnings for by million per diluted share 
although the aes transaction resulted in a pretax loss for book purposes  it resulted in a gain for tax purposes primarily because goodwill related to the aes businesses was not included in the tax basis of the net assets of aes 
therefore  we were required to make state and federal income tax payments associated with the divestiture 
the aes transaction generated net cash proceeds of approximately billion after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
net sales included in the year related to the aes businesses totaled approximately million  excluding intercompany sales 
in september  we sold lockheed martin control systems control systems for million in cash 
this transaction resulted in the recognition of an unusual gain  net of state income taxes  of million which is reflected in other income and expenses 
the gain increased net earnings for the year ended december  by million per diluted share 
this transaction generated net cash proceeds of million after related transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
net sales for the first nine months of related to control systems totaled approximately million  excluding intercompany sales 
in september  we sold approximately one third of our interest in inmarsat for million 
the investment in inmarsat was acquired as part of the merger with comsat 
as a result of the transaction  our interest in inmarsat was reduced from approximately to 
the sale of shares in inmarsat did not impact our results of operations 
the transaction generated net cash proceeds of about million after transaction costs and federal and state income tax payments 
on an ongoing basis  we will continue to explore the sale of various non core businesses  passive equity investments and surplus real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such holdings or real estate  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses  if any  would be recorded when they are probable and estimable 
we also continue to review our businesses on an ongoing basis to identify ways to improve organizational effectiveness and performance  and to focus on our core business strategy 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
effective january   we adopted fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the financial statements 
we completed the initial step of the goodwill impairment test required by the new rules and concluded that no adjustment to the balance of goodwill at the date we adopted the standard was required 
we also reassessed the estimated remaining useful lives of other intangible assets as part of our adoption of the statement 
as a result of that review  we extended the estimated remaining useful life of the intangible asset related to our f fighter aircraft program from six to ten years  effective january  the most important factors considered in making this determination included the existing backlog for f deliveries which extends production beyond the life we originally anticipated  and our outlook for potential new orders for the f during the next ten years 
relative to new orders  we expect that the f will continue to be the dominant fighter aircraft available for many countries in the international market until the f joint strike fighter is available 
as a result of the adoption  amortization expense for goodwill and certain other intangibles for was lower compared to by million  and was lower compared to by million 
logo continuing operations for  net sales were billion  an increase over sales 
sales for were billion  a decrease of compared to sales increased in all segments during as compared to sales growth in our aeronautics and technology services segments during were more than offset by decreases in the remaining business segments as compared to adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures  sales would have remained comparable when comparing to the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our sales for compared to in and in our results of operations for  and included the effects of various unusual items

interest expense for was million  million lower than the comparable amount in mainly due to reductions in our debt portfolio and the benefit from interest rate swap agreements 
interest expense for was million  million lower than the amount for mainly as a result of reductions in our debt portfolio 
our effective tax rate was for  for and for the rate for each year was affected by the tax impact from unusual items 
included in the unusual items for was a million tax benefit related to the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim 
in addition  for years prior to  the rates were increased by non deductible goodwill that was being amortized for financial accounting purposes 
for  the tax rate was further increased by write offs of non deductible goodwill for businesses divested in that year 
adjusting for the impact of unusual items and the adoption of fas  our effective tax rates would have been for  for and for for and these adjusted effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the lower tax rates on extraterritorial income 
for  the adjusted rate was higher than the statutory rate due to adjustments for revisions to prior year estimates 
for  we reported earnings from continuing operations of million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share for in  we reported a loss from continuing operations of million per diluted share 
these amounts included the after tax effects of unusual items which reduced earnings for  and by million  million and million  respectively

when recording the sale of ims in  we established transaction related reserves to address various indemnity provisions in the sale agreement 
the risks associated with certain of these indemnity provisions have been resolved and million  net of taxes  was reversed through discontinued operations in included in the loss from discontinued operations was an unusual after tax charge of billion per diluted share related to our decision to exit the global telecommunications services business 
the results also include an unusual after tax gain of million per diluted share from the third quarter sale of lockheed martin ims corporation

the results for and included after tax amortization expense of million and million  respectively  for goodwill and certain other intangibles that was not included in due to the adoption of fas logo discussion of business segments we changed the way we report the results of our business segments in the fourth quarter of the change in presentation is being made to align the way segment operating results are reported to senior management for their evaluation of segment operating performance 
we continue to operate in four principal business segments systems integration  space systems  aeronautics and technology services 
the changes include the following the corporate and other segment has been eliminated  operating profit loss from the operations of the four principal business segments is reconciled to the reported consolidated results utilizing the following items unallocated corporate income expense  net this caption includes unusual items discussed under results of operations above the effects of unusual items that are not considered part of management s evaluation of the segment s operating results eg  sales of surplus real estate  impairment charges  divestitures and other portfolio shaping activities are excluded from the business segment results  the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cost accounting standards cas  which are reported in the business segment results  and pension expense or income determined in accordance with fas as reported in note to the financial statements fas cas adjustment 
this amount was previously allocated to the business segments  the costs of our common stock based compensation plans  including our long term incentive performance award program 
this amount was also allocated to the business segments previously  corporate costs not allocated to the business segments and other miscellaneous corporate activities  including interest income and earnings and losses from our equity investments 
impact of adoption of fas discussed under results of operations above the impact of goodwill no longer being amortized and the change in the estimated remaining useful life of the contract intangible asset related to the f program is now excluded from segment results for all periods before january  for more information on the changes in our segment presentation and the reasons for the changes  see note to the financial statements 
the following tables of financial information and the discussions of the results of operations of our business segments have been adjusted to reflect the new presentation of segment operating results and correspond to segment information presented in note this table shows net sales and operating profit of the business segments and reconciles to the consolidated total 
in millions net sales systems integration space systems aeronautics technology services total business segments other operating profit loss systems integration space systems aeronautics technology services total business segments unallocated corporate expense  net impact of fas adoption the space systems and aeronautics segments generally include fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
therefore  due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the systems integration and technology services segments  the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments 
systems integration systems integration s operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit net sales for systems integration increased in as compared to sales increased as a result of higher volume in three of the segment s four lines of business 
increased sales at missiles fire control m fc of million were mainly due to higher volumes on the theater high altitude area defense thaad missile program and on certain tactical missile programs 
command  control  communication  computers and intelligence ci sales increased by million mainly as a result of volume on information superiority programs 
naval electronics surveillance systems ne ss sales increased by million primarily due to higher volumes on surface systems and radar systems programs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales related to volume declines on platform integration programs in the systems integration owego line of business 
net sales for the segment declined by in compared to sales would have increased for compared to had the sales attributable to the segment s aerospace electronic systems aes and control systems businesses  which were divested in the second half of  and the transfer of the payload launch vehicle plv contract to the space systems segment at the start of  been excluded from the comparisons 
sales increased by million as a result of volume increases in ne ss  primarily on tactical systems and surface systems programs  and undersea and radar systems activities 
m fc sales increased by million  mainly due to higher volume on certain tactical missile programs and the thaad missile program 
ci sales increased slightly year over year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales related to volume declines on platform integration programs at systems integration owego 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to increased operating profit of million from the sales growth at m fc  ci and ne ss more than offset lower operating profit of million at systems integration owego 
overall  a decline in volume on mature production programs at owego and m fc and higher volume on development programs at ne ss and m fc contributed to the slight decline in margins 
operating profit for the segment decreased in compared to operating profit would have increased by for from the previous year had the operating profit related to the divested aes and control systems businesses  as well as the plv contract transfer  been excluded from the comparisons 
increased operating profit of million from the sales growth at ne ss  ci  and m fc more than offset the decrease resulting from the volume decline at systems integration owego 
space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit net sales for space systems increased by in compared to the increase in sales for resulted from higher volume in government space of million and commercial space of million 
in government space  increases of million in government satellite programs and million in ground systems activities more than offset volume declines of million on government launch vehicles and million on strategic missile programs 
the increase in commercial space sales is primarily attributable to an increase in launch vehicle activities  with nine commercial launches during compared to six in net sales for the segment decreased by in compared to the decrease in sales for resulted from volume declines in commercial space of million  which more than offset increases in government space of million 
in commercial space  sales declined due to volume reductions of million in commercial launch vehicle activities and million in satellite programs 
there were six launches in compared to launches in the increase in government space resulted from a combined increase of million related to higher volume on government satellite programs and ground systems activities 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to volume declines in government launch vehicle activity  primarily due to program maturities  and by million due to the absence in of favorable adjustments recorded on the titan iv program in operating profit for the segment increased in as compared to  mainly driven by the commercial space business 
reduced losses in commercial space during resulted in increased operating profit of million when compared to commercial satellite manufacturing losses declined million in as operating performance improved and satellite deliveries increased 
in the first quarter of  a million loss provision was recorded on certain commercial satellite manufacturing contracts 
due to the industry wide oversupply and deterioration of pricing in the commercial launch market  financial results on commercial launch vehicles continue to be challenging 
during  this trend led to a decline in operating profit of million on commercial launch vehicles when compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower profitability of million on the three additional launches in the current year  additional charges of million net of a favorable contract adjustment of million for market and pricing pressures and included the adverse effect of a million adjustment for commercial launch vehicle contract settlement costs 
the results also included charges for market and pricing pressures  which reduced that year s operating profit by million 
the million decrease in government space s operating profit for the year is primarily due to the reduced volume on government launch vehicles and strategic missile programs  which combined to decrease operating profit by million  partially offset by increases of million in government satellite programs and million in ground systems activities 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to operating profit increased in due to a million increase in government space partially offset by higher year over year losses of million in commercial space 
in government space  operating profit increased due to the impact of higher volume and improved performance in ground systems and government satellite programs 
the year to year comparison of operating profit was not affected by the million favorable titan iv adjustment recorded in discussed above  due to a million charge related to a more conservative assessment of government launch vehicle programs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of in commercial space  decreased operating profit of million on launch vehicles more than offset lower losses on satellite manufacturing activities 
the commercial launch vehicle operating results included million in higher charges for market and pricing pressures when compared to these negative adjustments were partially offset by million of favorable contract adjustments on certain launch vehicle contracts 
commercial satellite manufacturing losses decreased slightly from and included the adverse impact of a million loss provision recorded in the first quarter of for certain commercial satellite contracts related to schedule and technical issues 
aeronautics aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to the higher sales were primarily driven by volume increases of million on the f joint strike fighter program  million on f a production contracts and a combined increase of million from higher volume on the f and c programs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline resulting from seven fewer c j deliveries compared to and a million decrease due to lower volume on f a engineering  manufacturing and development emd activities 
net sales for the segment increased by in compared to during  sales increased by million primarily due to the initial ramp up on f a production contracts and increased volume on f programs 
volume increases from f and c support activities also increased sales by million 
these increases were partially offset by declines in sales of million resulting from fewer f and c j deliveries in operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to increased operating profit of million primarily resulted from the higher volume on the programs noted in the discussion of sales 
operating profit for was negatively affected by a million charge recorded in the third quarter for performance issues on an aircraft modification contract and by a million change in estimate adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter related to cost growth on f a emd activities 
margins in were favorably affected by having seven fewer c j deliveries in the year as compared to the c j deliveries do not impact operating profit due to the previously disclosed suspension of earnings recognition on the program 
operating profit for the segment increased by for compared to for the year  operating profit increased by million due to increased volume and performance on the f a program  development activities on f and other aeronautical programs 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in f deliveries 
margins in were favorably affected by having five fewer c j deliveries as compared to technology services technology services operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit net sales for technology services increased by in compared to for the year  the increase in sales was primarily attributable to growth of million in the government information technology line of business  due to increased volume on existing programs and the acquisition of oao corporation effective december   and million in the defense line of business 
this growth was partially offset by a combined million decline in sales related to volume on the commercial information technology and nasa lines of business 
net sales for the segment increased by in compared to excluding the sales attributable to lockheed martin energy technologies and retech  two business units that were divested in  and the acquisition of oao corporation  sales would have increased for the year 
sales increased million primarily due to increased volume in the government information technology and military aircraft lines of business 
this growth was partially offset by lower sales volume associated with the segment s energy related contracts due to program completions 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to the increase is mainly due to improved performance in commercial information technology and the higher volume in government information technology  which together  increased operating profit by million 
these increases were partially offset by a combined decrease in operating profit of million on the military aircraft  nasa  defense and energy lines of business 
operating profit for the segment increased by for compared to operating profit increased by million in from higher volumes in the government information technology and military aircraft lines of business 
this improvement was partially offset by a million reduction in operating profit due to the completion of energy related contracts 
the technology services segment has a business unit which provides services to the government of argentina 
at december   we had investments in and advances to the business unit totaling about million 
while we expect that these amounts will be recoverable  there is always the potential that further devaluation of the argentine peso  deterioration in the argentine economy or other factors could adversely affect our ability to recover those amounts 
unallocated corporate income expense  net the following table shows the components of unallocated corporate income expense  net in millions unallocated corporate income expense  net unusual items fas cas adjustment other for information about unusual items  see the table under the previous discussion of continuing operations 
the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas and pension expense or income determined in accordance with fas is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit fas cas adjustment 
the cas funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments cost of goods sold 
this cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing  and is consequently included in the segments sales 
the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas income  and the fas cas adjustment in millions fas income cas funding and expense fas cas adjustment income logo backlog total negotiated backlog was billion at december  this amount includes both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for our products for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
funded backlog was billion at december  the following table shows total backlog by segment at the end of each of the last three years in millions backlog systems integration space systems aeronautics technology services logo liquidity and cash flows operating activities operating activities provided billion of cash in  compared to billion in and billion in operating activities included earnings loss from continuing operations  as adjusted for noncash items  and the cash provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
management of our working capital accounts accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and customer advances contributed million of cash flow in  billion in and million in the timing of income tax payments or refunds also affects our operating cash flows 
in  we received million from the settlement of the r d tax credit claim while in  we paid million of income taxes related to divested businesses 
included in operating activities is cash provided from discontinued operations of million in  million in and million in operating cash flows were sufficient to operate our businesses  finance capital expenditures and to pay dividends on our common stock each year 
investing activities investing activities used million of cash in  compared to providing million in and billion in cash used for property  plant and equipment expenditures increased in and in and included million in  million in and million in for the discontinued businesses 
during  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our discontinued telecommunications businesses and million primarily from the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
investments of million were made in  primarily related to our acquisition of oao corporation 
during  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our ims business 
investments in affiliated companies of million primarily consisted of million to complete our funding commitment to astrolink and million to intelsat 
the remainder of the activity was attributable to proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment  and various other investing activities 
during  we received billion from the sale of our aes business  million from the sale of our control systems business and million from the sale of a portion of our investment in inmarsat 
investments in affiliated companies of million mainly consisted of our funding commitment to astrolink of million and an additional investment in intelsat of million 
proceeds from the sale of property and other activities contributed million to our investing activities 
financing activities financing activities provided million of cash in  as compared to using billion in and billion in proceeds of million from stock option activity more than offset dividend payments of million  repayment of debt primarily esop obligations of million and million for the repurchase of million shares of common stock in including the million of debentures we called in to be repaid early and the million of debt we recorded relating to our guarantee of space imaging  llc s existing credit facility see the related discussions under capital structure and resources  debt maturities will amount to  million in during  improved operating cash flows and cash provided by investing activities allowed us to reduce our long term debt by approximately billion 
the reduction in long term debt was primarily attributable to the pre payment of notes issued to a wholly owned subsidiary of general electric company ge  payments on scheduled debt maturities  and the early retirement of certain other debt instruments 
debt retirements in were mainly attributable to our completing tender offers for some of our long term debt during the fourth quarter of we used billion to consummate the tender offers  resulting in the early repayment of billion in long term debt and an unusual loss  net of state income tax benefits  of million  or million after tax 
we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in other we receive advances on some contracts to finance inventories 
at december  and  approximately billion and billion  respectively  in advances  performance based payments and progress payments for work in process were received from customers and recorded as a reduction to inventories in our balance sheet 
also at december  and  million and million  respectively  of customer advances  performance based payments and progress payments were recorded in receivables as a reduction to unbilled costs and accrued profits 
approximately billion and billion of customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  which are usually from foreign governments and commercial customers  were included in current liabilities at the end of and  respectively see note 
capital structure and resources total debt increased by million during from a balance of billion at december  current maturities of long term debt at december  included million of debentures we called in to be repaid early and million of debt we recorded relating to our guarantee of space imaging  llc s existing credit facility see the related discussions below 
our long term debt is mainly in the form of publicly issued  fixed rate notes and debentures 
at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of billion  some of which will be used to meet scheduled long term debt maturities in total stockholders equity was billion at december   a decrease of million from december  this decrease was mainly attributable to our recognition of an additional minimum pension liability  which reduced stockholders equity on an after tax basis by billion  the payment of dividends of million and the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million 
stock option and esop activity of million and net earnings of million during the year partially offset the decline 
as a result of the above factors  our total debt to capitalization ratio increased from at december  to at december  in  in order to reduce interest expense and improve our debt to capitalization ratio  we decided to issue irrevocable redemption notices to the trustees for two issuances of callable debentures totaling million 
these debentures have interest rates that are higher than current market rates 
one notice was for million of debentures due on march   which were callable on or after march  the second was for million of debentures due on april   which were callable on or after april  we expect to repay amounts due on march  and april   respectively 
therefore  we have included the million in current maturities of long term debt on our balance sheet at december  we expect to incur a loss on the early repayment of the debt  net of state income tax benefits  of approximately million  or million after tax 
at the end of  we had in place a billion revolving credit facility  no borrowings were outstanding 
this credit facility will expire in november borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank base rate as defined 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
in october  we terminated our billion year credit facility 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
our management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
periodically  we may refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents including temporary investments  internally generated cash flow from operations and other available financing resources  including those described above  are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  as well as discretionary investment needs  during the next twelve months 
consistent with our desire to generate cash to reduce debt and invest in our core businesses  we expect that  subject to prevailing financial  market and economic conditions  we will continue to explore the sale of non core businesses  passive equity investments and surplus real estate 
at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt including capital lease obligations  and to make payments under operating leases 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt and capital lease obligations a operating lease commitments b total contractual cash obligations a amounts exclude a million adjustment to the fair value of long term debt relating to the corporation s interest rate swap agreements which will not be settled in cash 
b includes future payments related to a leasing arrangement with a state government authority for atlas v launch facilities 
total payments under the arrangement are expected to be approximately million over a year period 
lease payments began in august we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts to provide products and services to customers 
at december   we had contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit  guarantees and other arrangements  as follows commitment expiration per period in millions total commitment less than year years years after years surety bonds a standby letters of credit a guarantees total commitments a approximately million and million of surety bonds in the less than year and year periods  respectively  and approximately million and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year and year periods  respectively  are expected to automatically renew for additional one to two year periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
we have issued standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling billion related to advances received from customers and or to secure our performance under long term contracts 
amounts included in the table above totaling million are those amounts over and above advances received from customers which are recorded in the balance sheet as either offsets against inventories or in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
of the billion recorded in the balance sheet  approximately billion relates to a standby letter of credit to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
this letter of credit is available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance 
similar to the letter of credit for the f contract  letters of credit and surety bonds for other contracts are available for draw down only in the event of our nonperformance 
we hold a interest in a joint venture called space imaging  llc space imaging which we account for under the equity method 
space imaging was recently successful in obtaining certain long term commitments from the us government for purchases of commercial satellite imagery on an as needed basis 
however  to execute its current business plans and fund future replacement satellites  space imaging will likely need  but has not been able to obtain commitments for  additional investment or funding 
in addition to our equity investment  we also guarantee up to million of space imaging s borrowings under a credit facility that matures on march   and have about million in receivables from the joint venture at the end of in light of our decision and the decision of the other major member in the joint venture not to provide further funding at this time  our assessment that space imaging will likely not be able to repay its obligation under the credit facility when due  and the uncertainties as to whether space imaging will be successful in obtaining the additional investment necessary to fund replacement satellites  we wrote off our investment in the joint venture and recorded the obligation to fund amounts due from us under the guarantee 
as a result  we recorded a charge  net of state income taxes  of million which reduced net earnings by million per diluted share  and increased current maturities of long term debt by million  representing our obligation under the guarantee  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of in march  we converted our million shares of loral space communications ltd 
series a preferred stock into an equal number of shares of loral space common stock 
due to the market price of loral space stock and the potential impact of underlying market and industry conditions on loral space s ability to execute its current business plans  we recorded an unusual charge  net of state income tax benefits  of million in the third quarter of related to our investment in loral space 
the charge reduced net earnings by million  or per diluted share see note to the financial statements 
the value of our investment continues to be impacted by adverse market and industry conditions  including low demand for commercial satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
we satisfied our contractual obligation relating to our guarantee of certain indebtedness of globalstar  lp globalstar with a net payment of million on june  to repay a portion of globalstar s borrowings under a revolving credit agreement 
this payment resulted in our recording an unusual charge  net of state income tax benefits  of approximately million in which reduced net earnings for the year by million  or per diluted share see note to the financial statements for more information 
we have no remaining guarantees related to globalstar 
on february   globalstar and certain of its affiliates filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk mainly include commercial paper and fixed rate long term debt 
at december   we did not have any commercial paper outstanding 
we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates 
at the end of the year  we had agreements in place to swap fixed interest rates on about million of our long term debt for variable interest rates based on libor 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedges of the fair value of the underlying fixed rate debt instruments 
at december   the fair values of interest rate swap agreements outstanding totaled about million 
the amounts of gains and losses from changes in the fair values of the swap agreements were entirely offset by those from changes in the fair value of the associated debt obligations 
the interest rate swaps create a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
to the extent that the libor index on which the swaps are based increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by million annually on a pretax basis 
changes in swap rates would affect the market value of the agreements  but those changes in value would be offset by changes in value of the underlying debt 
a rise in swap rates from those at december  would result in a decrease in market value of about million 
a decline would increase the market value by a like amount 
we use forward foreign exchange and option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
these contracts are designated as qualifying hedges of the cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions  and related gains and losses on the contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized currently 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange and option contracts outstanding  as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year  were not material 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
environmental matters as more fully described in note to the financial statements  we have property that is subject to environmental matters 
in our opinion  the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
certain expenditures related to the recorded liabilities discussed below  after deducting any recoveries from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing the prices of our products and services under contracts with the us government 
the recorded amounts do not reflect the possible future recoveries of portions of the environmental costs through insurance policy coverage or from other prps  which we are pursuing as required by agreement and us government regulation 
these matters include the following items we are responding to three administrative orders issued by the california regional water quality control board in connection with our former facilities in redlands  california 
we are also coordinating with the us air force  which is working with the aerospace and defense industry to conduct preliminary studies of the potential health effects of perchlorate exposure associated with several sites across the country  including the redlands site 
the results of these studies are intended to assist us in determining our ultimate clean up obligation  if any  with respect to perchlorates 
in january  the state of california reduced the provisional standard for perchlorate concentration in water from parts per billion ppb to ppb 
although this provisional standard does not create a legally enforceable requirement for us at this time  we have developed a preliminary remediation plan that would meet the provisional standard if it were to become final 
because this plan entails a long lead time to be implemented  we have decided to begin implementing the plan and recognize the increased costs that are associated with the plan 
the balance sheet at december  includes a liability of approximately million which is our estimate of the remaining expenditures necessary to implement the remediation and other work at the site over the next years 
this amount is approximately million more than the amount recorded at december  as at other sites  we are pursuing claims against other potentially responsible parties prps  including the us government  to help with clean up costs 
we have also been conducting remediation activities to address soil and groundwater contamination by chlorinated solvents at our former operations in great neck  new york 
until the third quarter of  all of the remediation work associated with this site had been performed on the site itself 
in the third quarter  we entered into negotiations with the state of new york to implement an off site interim remedial measure intended to address an off site plume of groundwater contamination that was found to be moving more rapidly than originally anticipated 
this has led to an increase of approximately million in the projected future costs for the site 
total projected future costs are now estimated to be about million through this amount is included in our balance sheet at december  as at other sites  we are pursuing claims against other prps  including the us government  to help with clean up costs 
since  we have been responding to various consent decrees and orders relating to soil and regional groundwater contamination in the san fernando valley associated with our former operations in burbank and glendale  california 
under an agreement reached with the us government in  we will continue to be reimbursed in an amount equal to about of future expenditures for certain remediation activities by the us government in its capacity as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act 
we have recorded a liability of approximately million representing our estimate of the total expenditures required over the remaining terms of the consent decrees and orders for the glendale and burbank sites  net of the effects of the agreement 
we are a party to other proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental clean up issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a prp by the epa or by a state agency 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual burden for the costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site clean up and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  however  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
in addition to the amounts related to the redlands  burbank  glendale and great neck sites described above  a liability of approximately million for the other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years in which an estimate of financial exposure can be determined has been recorded 
we believe that it is unlikely that any additional liability we may have for known environmental issues would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
as described in note to the financial statements  we are continuing to pursue recovery of a significant portion of the unanticipated costs we incurred for a million fixed price contract with the us department of energy doe for the remediation of waste found in pit we have been unsuccessful to date in reaching agreement with the doe on cost recovery or other contract restructuring matters 
in  the management contractor for the project  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  at the doe s direction  terminated the pit contract for default 
we sued the doe in the us court of federal claims seeking to overturn the default termination and to recover our costs 
the management contractor  at the doe s direction  sued us in the us district court in idaho seeking  among other things  recovery of about million previously paid to us under the contract 
we filed counterclaims  again seeking to overturn the default termination and recover our costs 
in  the court of federal claims dismissed our lawsuit against the doe  finding that we lacked privity of contract with the doe 
on september   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the dismissal 
we did not appeal the decision further and will continue to seek resolution of the pit dispute through non litigation means while pursuing our remedies in the idaho proceeding  which is set for trial in august controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the sec is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo  as appropriate  to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures  management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily was required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost to benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries 
within days prior to the date of this report  we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures 
the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
based on the evaluation  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls after the date we completed the evaluation
