liquidity and capital resources working capital 
we had working capital of million as of december  compared to million as of december   with current ratios of to and to  respectively 
the increase of million was primarily due to the improved cash position resulting primarily from increased profitability 
we purchase large quantities of manufacturers close outs and direct imports  particularly in footwear and apparel merchandise categories

this can result in increased inventory levels and lower inventory turnover  thereby increasing our working capital requirements and related carrying costs

all borrowings are subject to various covenants 
the most restrictive covenants include a limit on quarterly measurements of year to date earnings loss  minimum gross margin percentage  maximum days inventory levels as defined and maximum annual spending levels for capital assets and prohibits the payment of dividends to shareholders
