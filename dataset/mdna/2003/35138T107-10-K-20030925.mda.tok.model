the company manages and reports its businesses in four segments filmed entertainment  which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media primarily in the united states  canada and europe  and the production of original television programming in the united states and canada  television stations  which principally consists of the operation of broadcast television stations in the united states  television broadcast network  which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the united states  and cable network programming  which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed through cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite dbs operators in the united states and professional sports team ownership in the united states 
sources of revenue filmed entertainment 
the filmed entertainment segment derives revenue from theatrical distribution  home video and dvd sales and distribution through pay per view  pay television services and broadcast television 
the revenues and operating results of the filmed entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the company s theatrical  home video and dvd releases  the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and the number of its television series in off network syndication 
theatrical release dates are determined by several factors  including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace 
each motion picture is a separate and distinct product  and its financial success depends upon many factors  including public acceptance 
television stations and television broadcast network 
the two reportable television segments derive their revenues principally from the sale of advertising time 
generally  advertising time is sold to national advertisers by the fox broadcasting company fox and to national spot and local advertisers by the company s group of owned and operated full power television broadcast stations o os in their respective markets 
the sale of advertising time is affected by viewer demographics  program ratings and general market conditions 
adverse changes in the general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues 
cable network programming 
the cable network programming segment derives revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from cable television systems and dbs operators based on the number of subscribers  net of the amortization of cable distribution investments  as well as from the sale of advertising time 
monthly affiliate fees are dependent on maintenance of carriage arrangements with cable television systems and dbs operators 
the sale of advertising time is affected by viewer demographics  program ratings and general market conditions 
adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued emerging issues task force no 
eitf  accounting for the consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which was effective for the company as of january  this eitf  among other things  codified the issues and examples of eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf states that customer incentives  which 
table of contents consist of the amortization of cable distribution investments capitalized fees paid to a cable or dbs operator to facilitate the launch of a cable network  should be presented as a reduction in revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
as required  the company has classified the amortization of cable distribution investments against revenues for all periods presented 
operating income loss  net income loss and earnings loss per share are not affected by this classification 
this classification affects the company s and the cable network programming segment s revenues 
the effect of the classification on the company s revenues is as follows for the year ended june  in millions gross revenues amortization of cable distribution investments revenues components of expenses filmed entertainment 
operating costs incurred by the filmed entertainment segment include exploitation costs  primarily prints and advertising  the amortization of capitalized production  overhead and interest costs  and participations and talent residuals 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  employee benefits  rent and other routine overhead 
television stations  television broadcast network and cable network programming 
operating expenses of the two reportable television segments and the cable network programming segment include expenses related to acquiring programming and rights to programming 
operating expenses also typically include production and technical expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcaster or cable network 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the broadcaster or cable network and sales commissions paid to the in house sales force involved in the sale of advertising as well as salaries  employee benefits  rent and other routine overhead 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of property and equipment  as well as amortization of finite lived intangible assets 
through fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense also included the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  resulting in a reduction of depreciation and amortization expense beginning in fiscal other operating charge 
the company has several multi year sports rights agreements  including a contract with the national football league nfl through fiscal year  contracts with the national association of stock car auto racing nascar through fiscal year and a contract with major league baseball mlb through fiscal year these contracts provide the company with the broadcast rights to certain national sporting events during their respective terms 
the nascar contract contains certain early termination clauses that are exercisable by nascar 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the rights costs against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related direct expenses over the expected contract lives 
at december   the company recorded an other operating charge of million 
this charge related to a change in accounting estimate on the company s national sports rights agreements caused by the downturn in the advertising market  which caused the company to write off programming costs inventory and to provide for estimated losses on these contracts over their estimated terms 
this evaluation considered the severe downturn in sports related advertising  the lack of any sustained advertising rebound subsequent to september th and the 
table of contents industry wide reduction of projected long term advertising growth rates  all of which resulted in the company s estimate of future directly attributable revenues associated with these contracts being lower than previously anticipated 
because the vast majority of costs incurred under these contracts are fixed  such as the rights costs and production costs  the results of these lower revenue estimates indicated that the company would generate a loss over the estimated remaining term of the sports contracts 
in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  the company has determined that the impact of the charge on basic and diluted earnings loss per share  net of tax benefit of million  for the year ended june  was loss per share 
the costs of these sports contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s operating profits to estimated total remaining operating profit of the contract 
considering the provision of million for estimated losses and absent a difference between the actual future revenues and costs as compared to the estimated future revenues and costs  no operating profit or loss will be recognized by the company over the estimated remaining term of the sports contracts 
the profitability of these long term national sports contracts as discussed above is based on the company s best estimates at june  of directly attributable revenues and costs  such estimates may change in the future  and such changes may be significant 
should revenues decline from estimates applied at june   an additional loss will be recorded 
should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues  none of the recorded loss will be restored  but the company will have a positive operating profit  which will be recognized over the estimated remaining contract term 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates 
filmed entertainment and television programming costs 
accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting by producers or distributors of films sop  which requires management s judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period 
these judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments 
filmed entertainment and television programming costs are amortized in the statement of operations in the direct proportion that revenues currently recognized bears to management s estimate of total future revenues to be received throughout the life of each motion picture or television program 
estimates of revenues are reviewed and reassessed periodically on a title by title basis 
in the television broadcast network segment  we amortize the costs of multi year sports contracts based on the ratio of each period s operating profit earned on the contract to the estimated total operating profit expected to be earned over the remaining life of the contract from all segments 
estimates of total operating profit to be earned over the life of the contract are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary 
management s estimates of total operating profit over the life of the contract are primarily dependent upon their 
table of contents projections of the revenue to be derived from selling advertising spots in the games and other directly attributed revenue sources as well as direct selling costs and the direct costs associated with broadcasting the games or events 
at the inception of these contracts and periodically thereafter  the company evaluates the recoverability of the costs associated therewith against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related expenses 
sales returns 
at the time of sale of home entertainment product  the company records as a reduction of revenue the estimated impact of returns  rebates and other incentives 
in determining the estimate of home entertainment product sales that will be returned  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of the company s product 
based on this information  management reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales that provide the customer with the right of return 
accounts receivable 
the company continuously monitors its customers payment profile and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
property  plant and equipment 
land  buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model or changes in the company s capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened  the company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
intangible assets 
the company has a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill  federal communications commission fcc licenses  sports franchises  and other copyright products and trademarks 
intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair market value at the date of acquisition 
goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity as compared to estimated amounts assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income 
the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives  and market multiples  among other items 
carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of the cash flows for that reporting unit 
an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key personnel  and acts by governments and courts  may signal that an asset has become impaired 
income taxes 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of its deferred tax assets  as the company believes that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
in making this estimate  management has considered in accordance with the tax sharing agreement as defined below future 
table of contents taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event that management determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded against the deferred tax asset with a corresponding charge to provision for income tax expense recognized in the period such determination was made 
employee costs 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  differences between actual results and assumptions are accumulated and amortized as part of net periodic pension costs over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
industry accounting practices revenue recognition 
revenues from theatrical distribution of feature films are recognized in accordance with sop paragraph 
specifically  revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited and revenues from home video and dvd sales  net of a reserve for estimated returns  together with related costs  are recognized on the date that video and dvd units are made widely available for sale by retailers and all company imposed restrictions on the sale of video and dvd units have expired 
revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast 
television advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired  net of agency commissions 
subscriber fees received from cable systems and dbs operators are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided  net of amortization of cable distribution investments 
revenues from professional team ownership are recognized on a game by game basis 
operating expenses 
in accordance with gaap  the company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual film forecast method 
under the individual film forecast method  such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management s estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title 
the costs of multi year national sports contracts for the television broadcast network segment are charged to expense based on the ratio of each period s operating profit to estimated total remaining operating profit of the contract 
the costs of sports contracts for the cable network programming segment and program rights for entertainment programs for the television stations and television broadcast network segments are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  generally based on the usage of the program or term of the license 
original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title and contract basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or a writedown of the film or television asset to fair value 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company adopted sop  which established new accounting standards for producers and distributors of films and supersedes sfas no 
sop establishes new accounting standards for  among other things  marketing and development costs 
the company recorded a one time  non cash charge of million  net of million tax  as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of july  this charge primarily reflects the elimination of marketing and certain development costs  which were previously capitalized under sfas no 
and are no longer capitalizable under sop subsequent to the adoption of sop  the company s accounting policy is to expense marketing and certain development costs as incurred

table of contents effect across all business segments of non cash depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of property and equipment  as well as amortization of finite lived intangible assets 
in fiscal and  depreciation and amortization expense also included the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
amortization of cable distribution investments represents a reduction against revenues over the term of a carriage arrangement and as such it is excluded from operating income before depreciation and amortization 
since operating income before depreciation and amortization is a non gaap measure  it should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  operating income loss  net income loss  cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
operating income before depreciation and amortization does not reflect cash available to fund requirements  and the items excluded from operating income before depreciation and amortization  such as depreciation and amortization  are significant components in assessing the company s financial performance 
management believes that operating income before depreciation and amortization is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company s business segments 
operating income before depreciation and amortization  which is the information reported to and used by the company s chief decision maker for the purpose of making decisions about the allocation of resources to segments and assessing their performance  provides management  investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment and enterprise value against historical and competitors data  although historical results  including operating income before depreciation and amortization  may not be indicative of future results as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences 
the following comparative discussion of the results of operations of the company includes  among other factors  an analysis of changes in business segment operating income before depreciation and amortization

for the year ended june   the company s revenues increased  million from  million for the year ended june  to  million 
this increase was primarily due to revenue increases at the filmed entertainment and cable network programming segments 
operating expenses 
table of contents increased approximately for the year ended june  due to increased theatrical and home entertainment marketing costs and home entertainment production costs at the filmed entertainment segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately as compared to the year ended june  due to the consolidation of the acquired stations as defined below and the wpwr television station 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased approximately due to the company s adoption of sfas no 
resulting in the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which impacted primarily the television stations and cable network programming segments 
for the year ended june   operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization increased  million to  million and  million to  million  respectively  from the corresponding period of the prior year 
these increases were in part due to the company s million other operating charge during the year ended june  for the write down of the company s national sports contracts without a comparative charge in the current year 
in addition  increased results at the television stations and cable network programming segments contributed to the increases in operating income and operating income before depreciation and amortization

on july   equity losses of affiliates would have improved by million for the year ended june  net income for the year ended june  was  million per share  an improvement of million from million per share for the corresponding period of the prior year 
this improvement is due to the increased operating results noted above for the year ended june  as compared to the corresponding period of the prior year and the company s million other operating charge during the year ended june  for the write down of the company s national sports contracts without a comparative charge in the current year 
these improvements were partially offset by the non recurring gains recognized on the sales of ffw and outdoor life network in the prior year without comparative gains in the current year 
filmed entertainment 
revenue at the filmed entertainment segment increased from  million for the year ended june  to  million  or 
this increase was primarily due to increased worldwide home entertainment revenues  most notably from the strong worldwide performance of ice age and shallow hal  and increased worldwide theatrical revenues due to the strong releases of x x men united and daredevil 
during fiscal  the company had several additional successful theatrical releases  including the domestic theatrical launches and subsequent strong home entertainment performances of like mike and drumline and the international theatrical launches and subsequent strong home entertainment performances of minority report and road to perdition 
prior year results included the strong worldwide theatrical  worldwide home entertainment

for the year ended june   the filmed entertainment segment reported operating income of million as compared to million for the prior year 
operating income before depreciation and amortization increased to million as compared to million for the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to the revenue increases noted above  most notably from ice age  and improved margins on dvd product due to increased volume  which were partially offset by increased home entertainment marketing costs 
at twentieth century fox television tcftv  for the year ended june   contributions increased due to increased worldwide home entertainment revenues for  angel  buffy the vampire slayer and the simpsons  higher network revenues for the practice and the domestic syndication of the x files and king of the hill 
improved profit rates on series due to dvd products and lower series production costs due to fewer episodes being produced also contributed to tcftv s increased results 
television stations 
on july   the company acquired the television broadcasting business of chris craft as defined below  consisting of ten television stations and subsequently exchanged four former chris craft stations with viacom  inc  clear channel communications  inc 
and meredith corporation for five other television stations after giving effect to these transactions the acquired television stations are referred to as the acquired stations 
in addition  in august  the company acquired wpwr in the chicago designated market area dma from newsweb corporation 
these acquisitions increased the number of the company s o os to full power stations  including nine duopolies 
for the year ended june   the television stations segment s revenues increased to  million from  million in the corresponding period of the prior year 
this million  or increase primarily resulted from higher advertising revenues  the impact of the acquired stations and the acquisition of wpwr 
advertising revenues in the markets of the company s o o s continued to improve versus the prior year  up approximately 
this increase is primarily due to the market rebounding and heavy political spending 
automotive  movies  telecommunications and political spending are all stronger than the prior year 
the revenue increases noted above contributed to the company s o os market share increase of percentage points from the prior year 
this market share gain was partially offset by heavy political spending on competitor stations this year  the loss of the new york yankee broadcasts in the new york market and the loss of the boston red sox broadcasts in the boston market 
for the year ended june   the television stations segment generated operating income of million  which was million  or higher than the prior year 
this increase was due to the revenue increases noted above and lower local program production costs as a result of the non renewal of new york yankee and boston red sox baseball game broadcasts 
this increase was partially offset by higher fringe benefits expenses  a full year of the acquired stations operating expenses in the current year  higher marketing costs to promote the fox prime time schedule and operating expenses of wpwr 
operating income before depreciation and amortization increased million to million from million 
television broadcast network 
for the year ended june   the television broadcast network segment s revenues increased million to  million from  million in the prior year 
this increase is due to higher ratings and pricing increases for prime time programming  most notably from american idol and joe millionaire  higher ratings for the nfl  and the daytona  which was not telecast on fox in the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by the non recurring telecast of the super bowl on fox in the prior year 
operating losses for the television broadcast network segment improved million to a loss of million and operating income before depreciation and amortization improved million to a loss of million compared to the corresponding period of the preceding year 
these operating improvements were driven by the revenue increases noted above and lower programming rights costs due to the non recurring telecast of the super bowl on fox in the prior year 
these improvements are partially offset by higher prime time license fees for returning series  increased costs for series cancellations  higher programming costs related to the company s national sports contracts  and increases in advertising expenses for prime time series 

table of contents cable network programming 
total revenues for the cable network programming segment increased by million or approximately from  million to  million for the year ended june  this increase reflects improved results across all of the cable network programming channels

the cable network programming segment reported operating income of million  an increase of million from the prior year 
these improvements were primarily driven by the revenue increases noted above  lower amortization expense due to the company s adoption of sfas no 
on july   the prior year bad debt provision related to adelphia communications corporation adelphia receivables and the consolidation of sunshine for the full year 
partially offsetting these improvements were higher expenses for programming enhancements and consumer marketing at fox news  higher programming costs at fx and speed channel  inc speed channel  higher average rights fees for professional events at the rsns and the consolidation of expenses from sunshine and fox sports international for the full year 
operating income before depreciation and amortization increased million to million from million from the prior year 
other operating charge 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the rights costs against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related direct expenses over the expected contract lives 
at december   the company recorded an other operating charge of million in its consolidated statement of operations 
this charge related to a change in accounting estimate on the company s national sports rights agreements caused by the downturn in the advertising market  which caused the company to write off programming costs inventory and to provide for estimated losses on these contracts 
this evaluation considered the severe downturn in sports related advertising  the lack of any sustained advertising rebound subsequent to september th and the industry wide reduction of projected long term advertising growth rates  all of which resulted in the company s estimate of future directly attributable revenues associated with these contracts being lower than previously anticipated 
because the vast majority of costs incurred under these contracts are fixed  such as the rights costs and production costs  the results of these lower revenue estimates indicated that the company would generate a loss over the remaining term of the sports contracts 
the charge  by contract was as follows nfl for million  mlb for million and nascar for million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million for the year ended june  from million to million due to the decreased interest expense resulting from the redemption of the notes as defined below in liquidity and capital resources and from reduced amounts due to affiliates of news corporation resulting from repayments

the company s share of rpp s income was million for the year ended june   as compared to losses of million in the prior year 
this improvement is primarily due to the prior year charges from madison square garden associated with the termination of two professional player contracts  significant cost savings at the metro channels  and lower amortization of intangible assets resulting from rpp s implementation of sfas no 
effective january  partially offsetting the improvement is a player compensation charge and lower earnings from the professional teams in fiscal the company s share of national geographic channel domestic s loss was million for the year ended june   as compared to a loss of million in the prior year

operating income improved million from a loss of million for the year ended june  to income of million for the year ended june   primarily due to improved results across all channels and the inclusion of results from the acquisitions  most notably speed channel which contributed million of operating income since its acquisition in fiscal these improvements were partially offset by the million write off of adelphia receivables

affiliate revenues increased at the rsns primarily from increased average cable rates per subscriber  as well as increases in total subscribers 
advertising revenues for the rsns were even with fiscal  primarily resulting from the weak advertising market 
revenues at speed channel increased from fiscal primarily due to increased average audience and new programming 
as of june   speed channel reached nearly million households 
fox cable networks group s operating income increased million or for the year ended june  revenue increases noted above primarily drove fox cable networks group s operating profit  partially offset by higher average rights fees associated with new professional sports rights agreements and an increase in the number of professional events telecast at the rsns  and increased programming and marketing costs associated with fx s fall prime time lineup and its new original series  the shield

other operating charge 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the rights costs against the revenues directly associated with the program material and related direct expenses over the expected contract lives 
at december   the company recorded an other operating charge of million in its consolidated statement of operations 
this charge related to a change in accounting estimate on the company s national sports rights agreements caused by the downturn in the advertising market  which caused the company to write off programming costs inventory and to provide for estimated losses on these contracts 
this evaluation considered the severe downturn in sports related advertising  the lack of any sustained advertising rebound subsequent to september th and the industry wide reduction of projected long term advertising growth rates  all of which resulted in the company s estimate of future directly attributable revenues associated with these contracts being lower than previously anticipated 
because the vast majority of costs incurred under these contracts are fixed  such as the rights costs and production costs  the results of these lower revenue estimates indicated that the company would generate a loss over the remaining term of the sports contracts 
the charge  by contract is as follows nfl for million  mlb for million and nascar for million 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million for fiscal from million to million due to a decrease in amounts due to affiliates of news corporation  the expiration of the new millennium film financing agreement in march and the classification of the expenses related to the new millennium ii film financing as minority interest in subsidiaries and lower amounts outstanding under single picture film financing 
equity losses of affiliates 
equity losses of affiliates for the year ended june  increased million to million from million in fiscal the primary reasons for the increase in equity losses of affiliates are a non cash compensation charge of which the company s share is million recorded before the sale of the company s interests in ffw 
in addition  the absence of earnings from the golf channel  which was sold in june  and decreased results at rpp and national geographic channel domestic  after its launch in january  contributed to increased losses

table of contents the company s share of national geographic channel domestic s losses were million for the year ended june   as compared to million in losses in fiscal as the channel launched in january  the growth in programming and advertising revenues was offset by the increase in the amortization of cable distribution investments in fiscal year also contributing to the losses was the increase in production and marketing expenses associated with a full year of operations 
as of june   national geographic channel domestic reached million households as compared to million households as of june  the company s share of rpp s losses was million for the year ended june   as compared to income of million for the year ended june  this decrease is primarily due to charges from the madison square garden msg division associated with the termination of two professional player contracts  the negative impact of losing the telecast rights of the new york yankees at msg network  lower revenues from the radio city music hall christmas spectacular as well as lower advertising revenues at its rsns 
these losses were partially offset by the favorable impact of cost savings at the metro channels and lower amortization of intangible assets resulting from rpp s implementation of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and utilizes derivative instruments in a limited manner to modify its exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
the company s policy is to enter into derivative and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its business objectives 
the company does not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
foreign exchange rate risk the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to minimize its limited exposure to exchange rate movements 
the foreign exchange contracts have principally been used to hedge the costs of producing films abroad and are principally denominated in the czech koruna  the mexican peso  the south african rand and the euro 
the company designates forward contracts and options used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges 
at june   the net fair value asset of financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
consistent with the nature of the economic hedge provided by such foreign exchange contracts  such gains or losses largely would be offset by corresponding decreases or increases  respectively  in the us dollar value of future foreign currency obligations
