use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements 
table of contents the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio consists of securities and short term investments which are purchased by the corporation to enhance the overall yield on earning assets and to contribute to the management of interest rate risk and liquidity 
investments in debt and equity securities are classified into three categories securities held to maturity  securities available for sale and trading securities 
the corporation classifies securities as held to maturity when it has both the ability and positive intent to hold securities to maturity 
securities held to maturity are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  computed primarily under the interest method 
securities not classified as held to maturity are designated as available for sale 
these securities may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in prepayment or extension risk  asset liability management decisions  income tax considerations or other circumstances identified by management 
securities available for sale are recorded at estimated market value  with the aggregate unrealized holding gains and losses reported  net of tax effect  as a separate component of shareholders equity 
the corporation s investment policy specifically prohibits the existence of a trading account portfolio 
on a periodic basis  management evaluates each security where amortized cost exceeds realizable value 
if the decline is judged to be other than temporary  the cost of the security is written down to estimated net realizable value with the write down included in net securities gains losses 
realized gains and losses are computed principally under the specific identification method 
loans held for sale there were no loans held for sale at december  the loans available for sale at december  were entirely comprised of small business administration sba loans 
these loans are carried at the lower of cost or market value obtained through secondary market bid quotations  net of any reserve for loan losses 
any realized gains and losses on these loans are included in other operating income 
loans and reserve for loan losses loans are stated at face value  net of unearned income and deferred fees 
lease unearned income is recognized over the loan term using the interest method 
interest on all other loans is recognized based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when  in management s judgment  it is determined that the collectibility of interest  but not necessarily principal  is doubtful 
when a loan is classified as nonaccrual  all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed 
interest receipts on nonaccrual loans are applied to principal 
net loan fees are deferred and amortized over the term of the related loan using the interest method 
the reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to provide for loan losses 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by loan losses net of recoveries 
management considers historical data concerning actual losses and loans classified by specific loan credit evaluation in determining the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
also considered in this process are loan delinquency trends  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and uncertainties in estimating losses  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates concerning future losses for each type of loan in the portfolio 

table of contents within the context of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  a loan is considered to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due for principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  the observable market price or  if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the underlying collateral 
when the measurement of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded in a specific valuation allowance through a charge to provision for loan losses 
this specific valuation allowance is periodically adjusted for significant changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows  observable market price or fair value of the collateral 
the valuation allowance  or reserve for impaired loan losses  is part of the total reserve for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  any related allowance is reversed through a charge to the impaired reserve for loan losses 
cash payments received on impaired loans are recorded as a direct reduction of the loan principal 
subsequent amounts collected are recognized as interest income 
impaired loans are not returned to accruing status until all amounts due  both principal and interest are current and there has been a demonstrated  sustained payment history 
the corporation collectively reviews leases and consumer loans under  and residential and commercial real estate under  for impairment 
in determining the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  the corporation establishes specific reserves for potential problem loans as determined by its loan review program 
the specific reserves on these loans are determined in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures taking into account the credit s current operating status  pledged collateral and plans of action for resolving any deficiencies 
the loss factors used in calculating reserves for loans classified as substandard  doubtful and loss credits are based upon historical loss trends and management s judgment of inherent risks associated within these loan classifications 
specific reserves are usually only considered for the corporation s commercial loan portfolio 
the corporation maintains general reserves for all loans not considered by the specific reserve method 
general reserves are calculated for each pool of homogeneous loans based on each loan type and corresponding risk rating  delinquency status and the historical charge off experience pertaining to each loan pool 
other relevant factors may include  among others  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation and the impact of government regulations 
while the corporation s specific and general reserve methodologies attempt to consider all relevant risk factors  they are subject to other elements of risk  but not limited to  potential estimation or judgmental errors 
unallocated reserves have been established to provide for such risks 
unallocated reserves also provide for risks associated with factors which may not be directly measured in the determination of specific or general reserves 
these factors include the impact of general economic and business conditions on the corporation s lending activity  credit quality trends  duration of the current economic or business cycle  and the impact of government regulations and other factors 
reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated losses related to these unfunded credit facilities 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the unfunded credit facilities including an assessment of the probability of commitment usage  credit risk factors for loans outstanding to these same customers and the terms and expiration dates of the unfunded credit facilities 
net adjustments to the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit are included in the provision for loan losses 
premises and equipment 
table of contents premises and equipment are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation 
premises and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives using either the straight line or an accelerated method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
costs for maintenance and repairs are expensed currently 
major improvements are capitalized 
when premises and equipment are disposed of  the accounts are relieved of the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization  and any resulting gains or losses are credited to or charged against income 
bank owned life insurance during and again during  the corporation purchased insurance on the lives of a certain group of employees and directors 
the policies accumulate asset values to meet future liabilities including the payment of employee benefits such as health care 
premiums of  and  are shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows for and  respectively 
increases in the cash surrender value and proceeds are recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of income 
the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance is reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets are comprised of other real estate owned and repossessed collateral  which are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell at the time of acquisition 
expenses related to holding the property  net of rental income  are generally charged against earnings in the current period 
income taxes deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the statutory tax rates 
deferred tax assets are reduced  if necessary  by the amount of such benefits that are not expected to be realized based upon available evidence

earnings per share the corporation accounts for earnings per share in accordance with sfas no 
this statement requires the disclosure of basic and diluted earnings per share and revised the method required to calculate these amounts 
basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period 
diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the number of net shares of common stock which would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options during each period using the treasury stock method 
basic and diluted earnings per share calculations include the retroactive effect of a stock dividend declared on april  and a stock dividend declared april

accounting for the impairment of long lived assets the corporation reviews long lived assets  such as premises and equipment and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or the extent or manner in which an asset is used  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  future discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset are estimated 
if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of the asset 
there were no long lived assets that were considered impaired at december  comprehensive income disclosures for all periods presented  other comprehensive income comprehensive income excluding net income includes only one component  which is the change in unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of related tax effects
