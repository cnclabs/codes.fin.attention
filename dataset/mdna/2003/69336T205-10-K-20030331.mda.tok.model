the table below sets out the cash contractual obligations of the company 
the operating leases are not recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  but payments are treated as an expense as incurred 
each contractual obligation included in the table contains various terms  conditions  and covenants which  if violated  accelerate the payment of that obligation 
the company leases four aircraft included in the lease obligations below 
the operating lease obligations primarily relate to the company s facilities in lafayette  louisiana 
payment due by year beyond total thousands of dollars operating lease obligations        long term debt   critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long lived assets and self insurance liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
phi estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on an evaluation of individual customer financial strength  current market conditions  and other information 
if the company s evaluation of its significant customers and debtors creditworthiness should change or prove incorrect  then the company may have to recognize additional allowances in the period that it identifies the risk of loss 
phi maintains inventory to service its own aircraft and the aircraft and components of customers 
portions of that inventory are used parts that are often exchanged with parts removed from aircraft or components and reworked to a useable condition 
the company uses systematic procedures to estimate the valuation of the used parts  which includes consideration of their condition and continuing utility 
if the company s valuation of these parts should be significantly different from amounts ultimately realizable or if it discontinues using or servicing certain aircraft models  then the company may have to record a write down of its inventory 
the company also records provisions against inventory for obsolescent and slow moving parts  relying principally on specific identification of such inventory 
if the company fails to identify such parts  additional provisions may be necessary 
the company s principal long lived assets are aircraft 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company measures recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows that it expects the asset to generate 
when an asset is determined to be impaired  the company recognizes the impairment amount  which is measured by the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
similarly  the company reports assets that it expects to sell at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company must make estimates for certain of its liabilities and expenses  losses  and gains related to self insured programs  insurance deductibles  and good experience premium returns 
the company s group medical insurance program is largely self insured  and the company uses estimates to record its periodic expenses related to that program 
the company also carries deductibles on its workers compensation program and aircraft hull and liability insurance and estimates periodic expenses related to the retained portion of those risks 
significant changes in estimates due to poor experience or higher accident rates could result in additional recorded losses 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the company  see note to the financials statements environmental matters the company has an aggregate estimated liability of million as of december  for environmental remediation costs that are probable and estimable 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reduced its recorded estimated liability by million as the result of a re evaluation of environmental exposure at all of its operating sites and lowered remediation cost estimates primarily at its morgan city  louisiana facility 
the company has conducted environmental surveys of the lafayette facility  which it vacated in  and has determined that contamination exists at that facility 
to date  borings have been installed to determine the type and extent of contamination 
preliminary results indicate limited soil and groundwater impacts 
once the extent and type of contamination are fully defined  a risk evaluation in accordance with the louisiana risk evaluation corrective action plan recap standard will be submitted and evaluated by louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq 
at that point  ldeq will establish what cleanup standards must be met at the site 
when the process is complete  the company will be in a position to develop the appropriate remediation plan and the resulting cost of remediation 
however the company has not recorded any estimated liability for remediation of contamination and  based on preliminary surveys and ongoing monitoring  the company believes the ultimate remediation costs for the lafayette facility will not be material 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates and prior to april   made limited use of derivative financial instruments to manage that risk 
when used  all derivatives for risk management are closely monitored by the company s senior management 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes and it does not use derivatives with leveraged or complex features 
derivative instruments are transacted either with creditworthy major financial institutions or over national exchanges 
on april   the company paid its terminated loan agreement 
the terminated loan agreement had variable interest rates 
in conjunction with the payment of the terminated loan agreement  the company settled its interest rate swap agreements by paying million to the counterparties 
also on april   the company issued notes of million that have an interest rate of payable semi annually on may and november of each year  beginning november   and mature in may the market value of the notes will vary as changes occur to general market interest rates  the remaining maturity of the notes  and the company s credit worthiness 
at december   the market value of the notes was million 
a hypothetical basis point increase to the notes imputed interest rate at december  would have resulted in a market value decline to approximately million
