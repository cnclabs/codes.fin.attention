we have historically financed these activities through private debt placements and the sale of equity securities to investors

the company expects to incur restructuring charges of approximately  in the quarter ended march  consisting of employee severance associated with the work force reduction and the separation and release agreement with the company s former president and chief operating officer 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of  we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these evaluations are done with the assistance of an independent valuation firm and include assumptions regarding future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
we have reduced our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in so doing  we have estimated future taxable losses in determining the valuation allowance 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we are exposed to market risk primarily through our investments in available for sale investments 
our policy calls for investment in short term  low risk investments 
as of december   we had no available for sale investments and as a result  any decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the non us dollar 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure
