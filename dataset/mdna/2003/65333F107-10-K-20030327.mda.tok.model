overview we provide digital mobile communications services using the nextel brand name in mid sized and tertiary markets throughout the united states 
we offer digital cellular services  direct connect the long range digital walkie talkie service  wireless data services  including email  text messaging  and nextel online  which provides wireless access to the internet  an organization s internal databases and other applications 
we hold licenses for wireless frequencies in markets where over million people  or pops  live and work 
we have constructed and operate a digital mobile network compatible with the digital mobile network constructed and operated by nextel in targeted portions of these markets  including of the top metropolitan statistical areas and of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the united states ranked by population 
our combined nextel digital mobile network constitutes one of the largest fully integrated digital wireless communications systems in the united states  covering of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the united states at the end of as of december  we had approximately  digital handsets in service in our markets 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our primary sources of revenues are service revenues and equipment revenues 
service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million recognized during our service revenues consist of charges to our customers for airtime usage and monthly network access fees from providing integrated wireless services within our territory  particularly mobile telephone and two way radio dispatch services 
service revenues also include roaming revenues from nextel subscribers using our portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
roaming revenues for accounted for approximately of our service revenues  as compared to in although we continue to see growth in roaming revenues due to an increase in coverage and on air cell sites  we expect roaming revenues as a percentage of our service revenues to continue to decline due to the anticipated revenue growth that we expect to achieve from our increasing customer base 
the following table shows the impact of our accounting policy whereby we defer activation fees and equipment revenue and related costs over a three year period for the year ended december  and for a discussion of this accounting policy  please see critical accounting policies revenue recognition

our equipment revenues consist of revenues received for wireless telephones and accessories purchased by our subscribers 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million generated in the same period in this growth in revenues was due to the increase in our subscriber base from our existing markets since we did not launch any new markets in in  we expect our revenues to continue to increase as we add more subscribers and continue to introduce new products to our customers 
however  although we anticipate continued growth in our revenues in  we have launched all of our markets  other than burlington  vermont and augusta  georgia  and we therefore do not expect to continue to experience revenue growth rates of the same magnitude as we have experienced in the past when we were launching new markets on a continuous basis 
for  our average monthly revenue per unit  or arpu  was  which was a decrease of compared to we attribute the decrease in arpu to an increase in competitive pricing plans  offset by an increase in the minutes used by our customers and additional usage of features such as voice mail  short message services and  to a lesser extent  nextel online services and nextel worldwide roaming products 
while we expect to continue to achieve arpu levels above the industry average  we anticipate our arpu to be in the mid to high s for the following table sets forth our revenues and arpu revenues dollars in thousands  except for arpu for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  of consolidated revenues service and roaming revenues   equipment revenues   total revenues   arpu arpu is an industry term that measures service revenues per month from our subscribers divided by the average number of subscribers in commercial service 
arpu is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and may not be similar to arpu measures of other companies 
the following schedule reflects the arpu calculation and reconciliation of service revenues reported on the consolidated statement of operations to service revenues used for the arpu calculation for the year ended december  dollars and units in thousands  except for arpu service revenues reported on consolidated statement of operations add activation fees deferred and recognized for sab   less roaming and other revenues   service revenues for arpu annual   average units subscribers arpu monthly cost of service revenues cost of service revenues consists primarily of network operating costs  which include site rental fees for cell sites and switches  utilities  maintenance and interconnect and other wireline transport charges 
cost of service revenues also includes the amounts we must pay nextel wip when our customers roam onto nextel s portion of the nextel digital mobile network 
these expenses depend mainly on the number of operating cell sites  total minutes of use and the mix of minutes of use between interconnect and direct connect 
the use of direct connect is more efficient than interconnect and  accordingly  relatively less costly to provide 
for the year ended december   our cost of service revenues was million as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
the increase in costs was primarily the result of bringing on air approximately additional cell sites since december   as well as an increase in airtime usage  both of which resulted in higher network operating costs 
increased airtime usage resulted both from the growth in the number of customers from as well as from the increased minutes of use per customer 
we saw an increase in minutes of use per average subscriber  which was average monthly minutes per subscriber for this is an increase of approximately as compared to average monthly minutes of use per subscriber in we expect cost of service revenues to increase as we place more cell sites in service and the usage of minutes increases as our customer base grows 
cost of equipment revenues cost of equipment revenues includes the cost of the subscriber wireless telephones and accessories sold by us 
as reflected in the following table  our cost of equipment revenues for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the same period in the increase in costs was related mostly to the growth in number of subscribers 
the table below reflects the cost of equipment revenues with the effect of sab for the year ended december  december  in thousands cost of equipment revenues cost of equipment revenues billed   cost of equipment revenues deferred effect of sab 
 previously deferred cost of equipment revenues recognized effect of sab total cost of equipment revenues reported   due to the unique push to talk functionality of our handsets  the cost of our equipment tends to be higher than that of our competitors 
as part of our business plan  we often offer our equipment at a discount or as part of a promotion as an incentive to our customers to commit to contracts for our higher priced service plans and to compete with the lower priced competitor handsets 
as a result  the table below shows the gross subsidy without the effect of sab no 
between equipment revenues and cost of equipment revenues was a loss of million for  as compared to a loss of million in  representing an increase of 
we expect to continue to employ these discounts and promotions in an effort to grow our subscriber base 
therefore  for the foreseeable future  we expect that cost of equipment revenues will continue to exceed our equipment revenues 
for the year ended december  december  in thousands equipment revenues billed   cost of equipment revenues billed total gross subsidy for equipment   selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  expenses related to customer care services and general and administrative costs 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses were million as compared to million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
sales and marketing expenses increased as a result of increased sales and marketing activities  including advertising expenses aimed to grow our customer base  our hiring of additional sales and marketing employees to accommodate the growth along with increased commissions for our direct sales force  and higher expenses related to a greater proportion of sales received from indirect distribution channels 
general and administrative costs relate to corporate personnel including tax  legal  planning  human resources  information technology  treasury  accounting and our customer care center operations

as we continue to grow our customer base and expand our operations  we expect our sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative costs to continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
however  we expect our acquisition costs per new customer to decrease as we continue to increase the amount of sales from our low cost distribution channels  including our retail stores and web based distribution channels  decrease equipment subsidies and work on increasing the productivity of our direct sales representatives

the million increase related primarily to depreciating the wireless network assets for the additional cell sites placed in service since december   along with furniture and equipment purchased to set up new offices 
we expect depreciation to continue to increase due to the additional cell sites we plan to place in service 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no

expenses increased in all categories as we launched new markets  added subscriber usage to the network  hired staff for functional departments and offices  and increased marketing and sales activities for the existing and newly launched markets 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs arise from the capital requirements necessary to complete the build out of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network and expand or enhance coverage in our existing markets  including the future acquisitions of additional frequencies  the installation of new switches and the introduction of new services 
without limiting the foregoing  we expect capital expenditures to include  among other things  the purchase of switches  base radios  transmission towers and antennae  radio frequency engineering  and cell site construction 
for the year ended december   we used million in cash for operating activities  as compared to million used for the same period in the decrease in the net use of funds was due to an increase in service revenues from customers  offset by an increased use of funds for operating activities related to hiring employees  billing system conversion  network operating costs for additional sites placed in service  increased marketing and sales activities  the purchase of telephone and accessory inventory  and an increase in receivables due to the growth of our customer base 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million as compared to the same period in the decrease in cash used in investing activities for was primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures for the network as our business focus shifted from launching new markets to expanding existing markets 
as of december  all of our markets except burlington  vermont and augusta  georgia  have been launched 
during  we invested million in capital expenditures spent primarily to build out the nextel digital mobile network in vermont and expand coverage on the nextel digital mobile network in our existing markets 
in addition  we completed construction of our switches in iowa and florida 
the additional switches are expected to result in an expense savings by reducing our switch sharing costs 
we also acquired certain network related assets including cell sites from nextel that included augusta  georgia and some important connecting corridors to complete connectivity of our respective territories 
these properties acquired from nextel provided us with approximately one million additional licensed pops 
furthermore  we invested million in fcc licenses during  which excludes the licenses for the properties recently acquired from nextel since the payment was accrued for but not actually paid by december  we anticipate our total capital spending in will be approximately million 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balance was approximately million compared to million as of december  in addition  we have access to an un drawn line of credit of million 
while we believe we have sufficient funds to continue the build out of our portion of the nextel digital mobile network to cover approximately million pops using the current mhz iden system  acquire additional frequencies  install additional switches  and provide us with the working capital necessary to cover our debt service requirements including projected cash interest expense of million and operating losses through after which time we anticipate achieving positive free cash flow  meaning revenues will be sufficient to fund not only operating expenses but also financing and capital expenditures  for the full fiscal year  we cannot assure you that additional funding will not be necessary 
additionally  to the extent we decide to expand our digital mobile network or implement a g technology  we would require additional financing to fund these projects 
in the event that additional financing is necessary  such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all  for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  restrictions in our debt instruments on our ability to raise additional funds  conditions in the economy generally  and in the wireless communications industry specifically  as well as market conditions and other factors that may be beyond our control 
the following table provides details regarding our contractual obligations subsequent to december  payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt and capital lease obligations    redeemable preferred stock  operating leases      purchase obligations   total contractual obligations     included in the purchase obligations caption are minimum amounts due under our most significant agreements for telecommunication services required for back office support 
amounts actually paid under some of these agreements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
in addition to the amounts reflected in the table  we expect to pay significant amounts to motorola for infrastructure  handsets and related services in future years 
potential amounts payable to motorola are not shown above due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and extent of these payments

the applicable margin for the term c and d loans is over libor and over the base rate 
for the revolving credit facility  the initial applicable margin is over libor and over the base rate until consolidated ebitda  as defined by the bank credit agreement  is positive  at which time the applicable margin will be initially over libor and over the base rate and thereafter will be determined on the basis of the ratio of total debt to annualized ebitda and will range between and over libor and between and over the base rate 
as of december   the interest rates on the million term b loan  the term c loan and the million term d loan were  and  respectively 
borrowings under the term loans are secured by a first priority pledge of all assets of our subsidiaries and a pledge of their capital stock

as discussed in more detail in business risk factors  if we fail to satisfy the financial covenants and other requirements contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes  our debts could become immediately payable at a time when we are unable to pay them  which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
in the future  we may opportunistically engage in additional debt for equity exchanges if the financial terms are sufficiently attractive 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions
