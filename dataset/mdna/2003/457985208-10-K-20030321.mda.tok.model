item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading risk factors 
general integra develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices  implants and biomaterials primarily for use in neurosurgery  orthopedics and soft tissue repair 
our business operates globally and is divided into two segments integra neurosciences tm and integra lifesciences tm 
integra neurosciences segment our integra neurosciences segment comprises our businesses that primarily sell directly to healthcare providers 
through our integra neurosciences segment we are a leading provider of implants  devices  and systems used in neurosurgery  neurotrauma  and related critical care  a marketer of surgical instruments and devices  and a distributor of disposables and supplies used in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders 
we sell our neurosurgery  neurotrauma  and related critical care products through a direct sales force of more than people in the united states and western europe 
we market surgical instruments and other devices to plastic and reconstructive surgeons  burn surgeons  hand surgeons  ent surgeons and other physicians through a direct sales force of eight people in the united states 
integra neurosupplies provides neurologists  hospitals  sleep clinics and other physicians with products used in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions and sleep disorders 
integra lifesciences segment our integra lifesciences segment includes our businesses that primarily sell through strategic partners or to original equipment manufacturer customers 
these businesses develop and manufacture a variety of medical products and devices  including products based on our proprietary tissue regeneration technology that are used to treat soft tissue and orthopedic conditions 
we have partnered with market leaders for the development and marketing efforts related to the majority of the products manufactured by the integra lifesciences segment 
these products address large  diverse markets  and we believe that we can promote them more cost effectively through leveraging marketing partners than through developing our own sales infrastructure 
we have strategic alliances with ethicon  inc a division of johnson johnson  wyeth biopharma  medtronic sofamor danek  and centerpulse 
acquisitions our recent growth in product revenues reflect increased sales of existing products  sales of newly launched products and sales of acquired businesses and product lines 
we have acquired ten businesses and product lines since january   and those acquisitions have contributed significantly to our growth 
reported product revenues for and included the following amounts in sales of acquired product lines revenues revenues in thousands integra neurosciences products acquired in  products acquired in   subtotal   all other product revenues   total integra neurosciences product revenues 
  integra lifesciences products acquired in  all other product revenues   total integra lifesciences product revenues 
  consolidated product revenues   excludes sales of the licox r product in those territories where integra neurosciences had exclusive distribution rights to the product prior to our acquisition of gmsmbh 
since the beginning of  we have acquired the following businesses and product lines in december  we acquired the epilepsy monitoring and neurosurgical shunt business of the radionics division of tyco healthcare group for million in cash 
we are moving the manufacturing of the acquired lines to our facility in biot  france and are selling the acquired products through our integra neurosciences sales force 
in october  we acquired padgett instruments  inc r  a marketer of instruments used in reconstructive and plastic surgery  for million in cash 
our acquisition of padgett instruments broadened our existing surgical customer base and allowed us to expand into new market segments 
we expect to complete the consolidation of padgett s operations into our distribution center located in cranbury  new jersey in march in september  we acquired certain assets  including the neurosensor tm monitor and rights to certain intellectual property  from novus monitoring limited of the united kingdom novus and entered into a related development agreement pursuant to which novus will  at its own cost  conduct certain clinical studies  continue development of an additional neuromonitoring product  and design and transfer to us a validated manufacturing process for these products 
we paid novus million in cash at closing and agreed to pay an additional million upon novus achievement of a development milestone and up to an additional million based upon revenues from novus products 
the neurosensor tm monitor received k clearance from the fda in february but has not been launched  pending the results of clinical trials and other factors 
we expect the novus products to complement our existing line of brain parameter monitoring products 
in connection with the novus acquisition  we recorded a million in process research and development charge for the value associated with the development of a next generation neuromonitoring system 
the design and functionality of this next generation neuromonitoring system is based  in part  on certain technology employed in the neurosensor tm system that has been modified specifically for this project and which has no alternative use in the modified state 
early prototypes of this next generation neuromonitoring system have been designed and manufactured based on this modified core technology 
novus remains responsible for the costs to complete development and obtain regulatory clearance for this project  the value of which we have recorded as prepaid research and development 
we estimated the value of the in process research and development with the assistance of a third party appraiser using probability weighted cash flow projections with factors for successful development ranging from to and a discount rate 
in august  we acquired the neurosciences division of nmt medical  inc for million in cash 
through this acquisition  we added a range of leading differential pressure valves  including the orbis sigma r  integra hakim r and horizontal vertical lumbar valves  and external ventricular drainage products to our neurosurgical product line 
the acquired operations include a facility located in biot  france that manufactures  packages and distributes shunting  catheter and drainage products  and a distribution facility located in atlanta  georgia 
we completed the consolidation of the atlanta operations into our cranbury  new jersey distribution center as of september  in july  we acquired the assets of signature technologies  inc  a specialty manufacturer of titanium and stainless steel implants for the neurosurgical and spinal markets  and certain other intellectual property assets 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  million of deferred consideration  and royalties on future sales of products to be developed 
our acquisition of signature technologies gave us the capability of developing and manufacturing metal implants for our strategic partners and for our direct sale 
signature technologies currently manufactures cranial fixation systems for sale primarily under a single contract manufacturing agreement that expires in june in connection with this acquisition  we recorded a million in process research and development charge for the value associated with a project for the development of an enhanced cranial fixation system using patented technology for improved identification and delivery of certain components of the system 
signature technologies has manufactured prototypes of this enhanced cranial fixation system and we do not expect to incur significant costs to complete development and obtain regulatory clearance to market the product 
we estimated the value of the in process research and development charge with the assistance of a third party appraiser using probability weighted cash flow projections with factors for successful development ranging from to and a discount rate 
in december  we acquired neurosupplies  inc  a specialty distributor of disposables and supplies for neurologists  pulmonologists and other physicians  for million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  a million note paid in january  and  shares of integra common stock 
integra neurosupplies markets a wide variety of supplies to neurologists  hospitals  sleep clinics  and other physicians in the united states as well as to original equipment manufacturers and distributors 
in april  we acquired satelec medical  a subsidiary of the satelec pierre rolland group  for million in cash 
satelec medical  based in france  manufactures and markets the dissectron r ultrasonic surgical aspirator console and a line of related handpieces 
we completed the consolidation of the satelec manufacturing operations into our andover  england and biot  france facilities in in april  we acquired gmsmbh  the german manufacturer of the licox r product  for million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash  the forgiveness of million in notes receivable from gmsmbh  and million of future minimum royalty payments to the seller 
prior to the acquisition  the integra neurosciences segment had exclusive marketing rights to the licox r products in the united states and certain other markets 
in april  we purchased the selector r ultrasonic aspirator  ruggles tm hand held neurosurgical instruments and spembly medical cryosurgery product lines from nmt medical  inc for million in cash 
we report revenues of the cryosurgery product line in our integra lifesciences segment 
in january  we purchased the business of clinical neuro systems  inc for million 
the purchase price consisted of million in cash and a million promissory note issued to the seller  which we repaid in full in the acquired business designed and manufactured neurosurgical external ventricular drainage systems  catheters  drainage bags  and cranial access kits 
we have accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and have included the results of operations of each of the acquired businesses in our consolidated financial statements since its date of acquisition 
the following table provides a comparison of pro forma product revenues for the years and as if all acquisitions completed after january  had occurred as of the beginning of that year 
this pro forma product revenues data is based upon estimates of product revenues generated by the acquired businesses during the period prior to which integra acquired them and does not necessarily represent results that would have occurred if the acquisitions had taken place on the basis assumed above

    consolidated product revenues     other revenue     total revenue     on march   we acquired jarit r surgical instruments  inc jarit for million in cash  subject to a working capital adjustment and other adjustments with respect to certain income tax elections 
for more than years  jarit has marketed a wide variety of high quality  reusable surgical instruments to virtually all surgical disciplines 
jarit sells its products to more than  hospitals and surgery centers worldwide 
in the united states  jarit sells through a person sales management force that works with over distributor sales representatives 
with more than  instrument patterns and a order fill rate  jarit has developed a strong reputation as a leading provider of high quality surgical instruments 
jarit manages its vendor relationships and purchases  packages and labels its products directly from instrument manufacturers through its facility in tuttlingen  germany 
the acquisition of jarit broadens integra s existing customer base and surgical instrument product offering and provides an opportunity to achieve operating costs savings  including the procurement of integra s redmond tm ruggles tm and padgett instruments inc r products directly from the instrument manufacturers 
the acquired business generated approximately million in revenues and million in income before income taxes for the year ended december  we expect to report the results of jarit in the integra neurosciences segment 
results of operations as a result of our recent acquisitions  the following financial results may not be directly comparable

excluding these adjustments  gross margin as a percentage of product revenues would have been  and  in  and  respectively 
the adjusted gross margins as a percentage of product revenue increased slightly in as the increased percentage of overall product revenues from the higher margin integra neurosciences segment was offset by the lower margins in our integra lifesciences segment 
we expect our future gross margins to benefit as the higher margin integra neurosciences segment continues to grow faster than the integra lifesciences segment 
we also have developed or are developing plans to improve gross margins by consolidating our manufacturing facilities and increasing the efficiency of various manufacturing sites 
net income in was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million in  or per diluted share  and a net loss of million in  or per diluted share 
included in these amounts are certain charges or gains resulting from facts and circumstances that  based on our recent history and future expectations  may not recur with similar materiality or impact on continuing operations 
we believe that the identification of all charges and gains that meet this criteria promotes comparability of reported financial results 
the following special charges and gains were included in net income loss and net income loss per share recorded in a million deferred income tax benefit primarily from the reduction of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards  and acquired in process research and development charges of million recorded in connection with acquisitions 
recorded in a million deferred income tax benefit from the reduction of a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards  and an extraordinary loss of  net of tax  from the early retirement of debt  recorded in a million non cash  stock based compensation charge related to the extension of the chief executive officer s employment agreement recorded in operating expenses  a million gain on the sale of product lines  a  charge recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change associated with the adoption of a new accounting policy for revenue recognition  and a million non recurring  non cash dividend related to the beneficial conversion feature of our series c convertible preferred stock when it was issued in march that did not affect the reported net loss for but was reflected in the calculation of net loss per share for  the following discussion of segment financial results excludes corporate general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets  which are not included in the measurement of segment operating results

increased sales of our duragen r dural graft matrix accounted for most of our growth in neurosurgical operating room product revenue in revenue from sales of neurosurgical shunt product lines acquired in  offset in part by a decline in sales from our existing shunt lines  and increased sales of our neuragen tm nerve guide and ultrasonic aspirators also contributed to the growth in our neurosurgical operating room product revenue 
revenue from sales of drainage product lines acquired in and increased sales of our intracranial monitoring systems and existing drainage systems all contributed significantly to the growth in our neurosurgical intensive care unit product revenues in substantially all of the growth in other neurosciences products revenue in was attributable to product lines acquired in and in december we expect that our future growth will derive from our expanded domestic sales force  the continued implementation of our direct sales strategy in europe and from internally developed and acquired products 
we also intend to acquire businesses that complement our existing businesses and products 
cost of product revenues included   and  in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in   and  respectively 
excluding these adjustments  gross margin as a percentage of product revenues would have been  and  in  and  respectively 
the continued improvement in gross margins is primarily the result of an improved sales mix of higher margin products and increased direct sales to hospitals in europe 
effective january  we began to sell our neurosurgical products to certain hospitals through a group purchasing organization 
group purchasing organizations use the leverage of large  organized buying groups to obtain better prices for medical products for the participating hospitals and other health care providers than might otherwise be available to these institutions individually 
we expect that our participation in group purchasing organizations will improve our ability to sell our products to those participating hospitals that have not historically purchased from us 
in and  other revenue consisted primarily of technology related royalties 
other revenue decreased by  in from the expiration of a technology related royalty agreement 
in  we recorded million of in process research and development charges in connection with our acquisitions of signature technologies  inc and certain assets of novus monitoring limited 
other research and development expenses increased in as a result of increased headcount and spending on product development 
we expect to continue to increase our efforts and focus on product development in the future 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to the development of a collagen hemostatic device for use in neurosurgical procedures and development costs for the neuragen tm nerve guide product 
excluding the in process research and development charges recorded on the signature and novus acquisitions  research and development expenses represented   and of total product revenues in   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses have increased significantly since  consistent with the expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing infrastructure and increased trade show activities 
sales and marketing expenses represented of total product revenues in each of the years through since the end of  we have more than doubled the size of our domestic neurosurgical sales organization to more than professionals  including neurospecialists  regional managers and clinical educators 
with the acquisitions of gmsmbh and satelec medical in april and the neurosciences division of nmt medical in july  we have a direct neurosurgical sales and marketing presence in the key markets of western europe 
through the acquisition of padgett instruments in we have an eight person direct sales force in the united states that sells to plastic and reconstructive surgeons  burn surgeons  hand surgeons  ent surgeons and other physicians 
through the acquisition of jarit surgical instruments in march  we have a person sales management force in the united states that works with over distributor sales representatives selling to virtually all surgical disciplines 
general and administrative expenses increased million in  million of which were operating costs associated with recently acquired businesses that were not reflected in our results for the full year in general and administrative expenses decreased  in  primarily as a result of the recording in of a write off of a large distributor account and improved accounts receivable collections in integra lifesciences segment in thousands product revenues tissue repair products    other medical devices    total product revenues    other revenue    total revenue    cost of product revenues    gross margin on product revenues    gross margin as a percentage of product revenues 
research and development expenses    sales and marketing expenses   general and administrative expenses    operating income    product revenues in the integra lifesciences segment increased million in to million  a increase over this growth was generated primarily by increased revenues from the absorbable collagen sponge component of medtronic s recently approved infuse tm bone graft product 
other medical devices product revenues in included million in sales of product lines acquired in product revenues in the integra lifesciences segment increased million in to million  a increase over this growth was generated primarily by a million increase in revenues from tissue repair products and a  increase in revenues from the cryosurgery product line acquired in the second quarter of the increase in sales of tissue repair products was primarily generated by higher sales of the integra r dermal regeneration template and our absorbable collagen sponge 
gross margins decreased slightly in from as unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances and the inclusion of lower margin signature technologies products offset the effect of increased sales of our higher margin products 
we have identified and corrected the source of s unfavorable manufacturing variances 
other revenue consists of research and development funding from strategic partners and government grants  and license  distribution  and other event related revenues from strategic partners and other third parties 
other revenue increased by  in as the receipt of million in event related payments offset a decline in government grant funding 
the decline in other revenue in was primarily the result of million of event related revenues received in  as compared to none in  partially offset by higher research and development funding received in other revenue includes million per year in research and development funding related to our strategic alliance with ethicon 
the ethicon agreement provides us with research funding of million per year through the year after  funding amounts are based on a percentage of net revenues of the integra r dermal regeneration template 
in  the fda approved a premarket approval pma supplement to permit the marketing of the integra r dermal regeneration template for the repair of scar contractures in patients who have already recovered from their initial wound 
in we also received fda k clearance to sell related products  integra tm bilayer matrix wound dressing and integra tm matrix wound dressing  for the dressing of wounds  including chronic wounds 
we are continuing to work with ethicon to obtain additional marketing indications for the integra r product 
although the research  development and distribution agreements with our strategic partners provide us with funding when certain events occur  such as advances in research programs  critical publications or product approvals  the timing of these event payments is uncertain and difficult to predict 
research and development expense declined million in from reduced spending on integra r dermal regeneration template and a million decrease in government grants for research 
the decrease in research and development expenses in was the result of the termination of a program with a partner to develop a product to regenerate articular cartilage  partially offset by increased spending on programs with our other development partners 
our strategic marketing partners and distributors are primarily responsible for sales and marketing activities in the integra lifesciences segment 
sales and marketing costs have decreased since as a result of the transition of integra r dermal regeneration template selling and marketing activities to ethicon in june and lower distributor selling costs 
in  we sold million of integra r dermal regeneration template to ethicon and received million in research payments and million in clinical and regulatory event payments that were recorded in other revenue 
ethicon has not been successful in selling the minimum amounts of integra r dermal regeneration template specified in its agreement with us 
in addition  we have notified ethicon that certain clinical and regulatory events have been achieved under the agreement and that payments for the achievement of those events is due to us 
ethicon has informed us that it disagrees that the clinical and regulatory events in question have been achieved  and that it does not intend to make the payments we have demanded 
in addition  ethicon has informed us that if we do not agree to substantial amendments to its agreement with us  it will consider alternatives that may include exercising its right to terminate the agreement 
the agreement requires ethicon to give us notice one year in advance of a termination of the agreement  during which time ethicon is required to continue to comply with the terms of the contract 
at the end of that period  ethicon may be required to pay additional amounts based on the termination provisions of the agreement and is required to cooperate in the transfer of the business back to integra 
additionally  ethicon may apply the value of any minimum payments in excess of actual product purchases against future purchases of products for sale on a non exclusive basis for a specified period of time 
if ethicon does terminate the agreement or if we determine that ethicon is in breach of the agreement and we terminate the agreement  there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the money that we believe ethicon is obligated to pay us under the agreement 
if ethicon does give us notice that it will terminate the agreement  it is possible that ethicon will diminish its sales and marketing efforts for the product during the one year notice period and that its sales will decline as a result 
in addition  we may not be successful in sustaining or restoring the sales of the integra r dermal regeneration template at current levels after the termination date 
finally  if ethicon terminates the agreement it is possible that we may become involved in litigation with ethicon  which could also impair our ability to sell products under our other agreements with ethicon  including the biopatch r and instat r products 
corporate expenses and amortization in thousands total segment operating costs and expenses    corporate general and administrative expenses    amortization    consolidated total operating expenses    corporate general and administrative expenses increased by  in primarily as a result of increased facility rent at our expanded corporate headquarters and higher insurance and legal costs 
corporate general and administrative expenses in included the million non cash  stock based compensation charge related to the extension of the chief executive officer s employment agreement 
excluding this amount  the million decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses in resulted primarily from a decrease in legal expenses related to the conclusion of the jury trial in the patent infringement lawsuit against merck kgaa in the first quarter of as well as a reduction in other litigation matters outstanding in  and reduced spending in other corporate functions 
amortization expense decreased in because of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized 
excluding the effect of the recently acquired jarit instruments business  annual amortization expense is expected to approximate million in both and  million in both and  and million in non operating income and expenses in august  we raised million from a follow on public offering of million shares of common stock  of which million was subsequently used to repay all outstanding indebtedness 
accordingly  net interest income in increased to million  as compared to net interest income of million in and net interest expense of  in we recorded a million pre tax gain on the disposition of two product lines in income taxes since  we have generated positive taxable income on a cumulative basis 
in light of this trend  our current projections for future taxable earnings  and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences  we concluded in the fourth quarter of that we no longer needed to maintain a portion of the valuation allowance recorded against federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary differences 
we reduced the valuation allowance by million in because we believed that it was more likely than not that we would realize the benefit of that portion of the deferred tax assets recorded at december  the million reduction in the valuation allowance consisted of an million deferred income tax benefit and a  credit to additional paid in capital related to net operating loss carryforwards generated through the exercise of stock options 
in the fourth quarter of  we reduced the remaining valuation allowance recorded against net operating loss carryforwards by million  which reflected our estimate of additional tax benefits that we expect to realize in the future 
the million reduction in the valuation allowance consisted of a million deferred income tax benefit and a million credit to additional paid in capital related to net operating loss carryforwards generated through the exercise of stock options 
a valuation allowance of million is recorded against the remaining million of net deferred tax assets recorded at december  this valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for certain expenses which will be deductible for tax purposes in very limited circumstances and for which we believe it is unlikely that we will recognize the associated tax benefit 
we do not anticipate additional income tax benefits through future reductions in the valuation allowance 
however  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period such a determination is made 
the net change in the company s valuation allowance was million  million  and million  in   and  respectively 
included in the reduction was the write off of the valuation allowance associated with million of deferred tax assets which the company wrote off because they are no longer expected to be utilizable 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  to offset future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through and  respectively 
new jersey has imposed a moratorium on the ability of corporations to use their net operating loss carryforwards to reduce their new jersey state tax obligations 
in  we recognized a tax benefit of  from the sale of certain state net operating loss carryforwards through a special program offered by the state of new jersey 
at december   several of our subsidiaries had unused net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to our ownership which expire through the internal revenue code limits the timing and manner in which we may use any acquired net operating losses or tax credits 
international product revenues and operations because we have operations based in europe and we generate certain revenues and incur certain operating expenses in british pounds and the euro  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
currently  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
as the volume of our business transacted in foreign currencies increases  we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if this potential impact is believed to present a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments  including forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies  to mitigate this risk 
additionally  we generate significant revenues outside the united states  a substantial portion of which are us dollar denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries where the us dollar has increased compared to the local currency 
our sales to foreign markets may be affected by local economic conditions 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
product revenues by major geographic area are summarized below united asia other states europe pacific foreign consolidated in thousands product revenues in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies from our foreign based subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and france 
we expect revenues from customers outside the united states and expenses and revenues denominated in foreign currencies to increase in absolute terms  but not as a proportion of our total revenues  in as our acquisition of a significant facility in france in july and our continued expansion of our european sales force offset the effect of our recent acquisitions of entities that sell solely in the united states 
in  revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies from our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  germany and france 
in  revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
of this amount  million of these revenues were generated in foreign currencies from our subsidiary based in the united kingdom  which was acquired in april liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of equity securities  product revenues  research and collaboration funding  borrowings under a revolving credit line and cash acquired in connection with business acquisitions and dispositions 
since  we have substantially reduced our net use of cash from operations and  in and  we generated positive operating cash flows of million and million  respectively 
operating cash flows improved in as a result of higher net income and improved working capital management 
our principal uses of funds in were million for business acquisitions  the repayment of a million note given to a seller as consideration for the acquisition of neurosupplies  inc and million for purchases of property and equipment 
principal sources of funds were approximately million from the issuance of common stock and million of positive operating cash flow 
on august   we issued million shares of common stock in a public offering at per share 
the net proceeds generated by the offering  after expenses  were million 
with the proceeds from the public offering of common stock  we repaid all outstanding debt  including million of bank loans and million payable under the terms of a promissory note  in the third quarter of additionally  a related term loan and revolving credit facility was terminated in august we had no debt outstanding at december at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
investments consist almost entirely of highly liquid  interest bearing debt securities 
we believe that our cash and marketable securities are sufficient to finance our operations in the short term 
however  given the significant level of liquid assets and our objective to grow by acquisition and alliances  our financial position and future financial results could change significantly if we were to complete a business acquisition by utilizing a significant portion of our liquid assets 
on march   we used million to acquire the business of jarit instruments 
excluding the effect of the acquisition of jarit surgical instruments in march  we are obligated to pay approximately million and million in and respectively  under the terms of operating lease agreements for our facilities 
thereafter  through  we are contractually obligated to pay an aggregate of million in total lease costs 
we may be obligated to pay novus an additional million upon novus achievement of a development milestone and up to an additional million based upon revenues from novus products 
additionally  we are obligated to pay royalties based on sales of certain of our products  including million in future guaranteed minimum royalty payments to the seller of the gmsmbh business 
we have no other significant future contractual obligations 
in february  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to one million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost not to exceed million 
we may repurchase shares under this program through february either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during  we repurchased  shares of our stock for an aggregate purchase price of million under a previously authorized share repurchase program 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns  net realizable value of inventories  estimates of future cash flows associated with long lived asset valuations and acquired in process research and development charges  depreciation and amortization periods for long lived assets  valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets  loss contingencies  and estimates of costs to complete performance obligations associated with research  licensing  and distribution arrangements for which revenue is accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which form the basis for developing these estimates  are those that are most critical to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future changes to the sales returns and allowances provision 
inventories 
inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out method  or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities  obsolescence or shelf life expiration 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
to the extent that we determine there are excess  obsolete or expired inventory quantities  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets to be held and used  including property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used by comparing its carrying value with the projected undiscounted net cash flows applicable to the long lived assets 
if an impairment exists  we calculate the amount of such impairment based on the estimated fair value of the asset 
we record impairments to long lived assets to be disposed of based upon the fair value of the applicable assets 
if future events that would trigger an impairment review occur or we change our estimates of projected future undiscounted net cash flows related to long lived assets to be held and used  we may need to record an impairment charge 
goodwill 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in january  our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill changed to a method based upon a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned with its respective fair value 
we completed our initial impairment review for goodwill as of june  and determined that our reporting unit goodwill was not impaired 
if future events that would trigger an impairment review occur or we change our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  we may need to record an impairment charge 
acquired in process research and development charges 
in process research and development charges are recorded in connection with acquisitions and represent the value assigned to acquired assets which have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which there is no alternative use 
fair value is generally assigned to these assets based on the net present value of the projected cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
significant assumptions underlying these cash flows include our assessment of the timing and our ability to successfully complete the in process research and development project  projected cash flows associated with the successful completion of the project  and interest rates used to discount these cash flows to their present value 
depreciation and amortization periods 
we provide for depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows 
if our assessment of the useful lives of these long lived assets changes  we may change future depreciation and amortization expense 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our projections for future taxable earnings and the expected timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in  this analysis resulted in our reducing the recorded valuation allowance by million 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period we make such a determination 
we would record the adjustment in the earnings of such period or  to the extent the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits from the exercise of stock options  as a credit to additional paid in capital 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales when delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  there is a fixed or determinable sales price  and collectibility of that sales price is reasonably assured 
we recognize research grant revenue when the related expenses are incurred 
under the terms of existing research grants  we are reimbursed for allowable direct and indirect research expenses 
we recognize royalty revenue over the period our customers sell the royalty products and the amount earned by integra is fixed and determinable 
we recognize non refundable fees received under research  licensing and distribution arrangements as revenue when received if we have no continuing obligations to the other party 
for those arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations  we recognize revenue using the lesser of the amount of non refundable cash received or the result achieved using percentage of completion accounting based upon our estimated cost to complete these obligations 
if our estimates of the costs to complete these obligations change  we may change the amount of revenue we recognized for fees received under research  licensing and distribution arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees and with respect to our products 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  and are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by these contingencies if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to financial risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exchange a discussion of foreign currency exchange risks is provided under the caption international product revenues and operations under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate and credit risk we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale marketable debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities outstanding at december  would increase or decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis 
we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these investments
