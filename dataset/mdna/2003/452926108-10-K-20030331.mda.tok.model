item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction iori invests in equity interests in real estate through acquisitions  leases  partnerships and in mortgage loans 
iori is the successor to a california business trust organized on december   which commenced operations on april  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of iori s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgements 
iori s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  management performs a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if management decides to sell rental properties or land held for development  management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized within income from continuing operations 
iori s estimates of cash flow and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and considers matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
iori s estimates are subject to revision as market conditions and iori s assessments of them change 
iori s allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts 
management considers such information as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant or other debtor and iori s assessment of its ability to meet its lease or interest obligations 
iori s estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions 
obligations and commitments iori has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to the payment of mortgages 
the following table aggregates iori s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  dollars in thousands 
payments due by period in thousands thereafter total variable interest rate notes instrument s maturities    instrument s amortization 
  interest   fixed interest rate notes instrument s maturities     instrument s amortization 
  interest        principal payments       liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled   and million at december   and iori s principal sources of cash have been and will continue to be property operations  proceeds from property sales and refinancings and partnership distributions 
although management anticipates that iori will generate excess cash from operations in due to increased rental rates and occupancy at its properties  such excess  however  will not be sufficient to discharge all of iori s debt obligations as they mature 
management intends to selectively sell income producing real estate  refinance real estate and incur additional borrowings against real estate to meet its cash requirements 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the primary factors affecting cash flow from operating activities are discussed in the following paragraphs 
cash flow from property operations rents collected less payments for property operating expenses was million in  million in  and million in in  a decrease of million was due to the sale of two office buildings in and  was due to decreased occupancies at iori s commercial properties 
of the decrease in from  million was due to the sale of three apartments and two office buildings in the decrease was offset in part by an increase of  from the purchase of five apartments in and an increase of  due to increased rental rates and occupancies at iori s apartment and commercial properties 
interest collected was  in   in  and  in the increase in was due to the funding of two notes 
the decrease in from was due to a decrease in short term investment income and the partial paydown of one mortgage note receivable in interest paid on notes payable was million in  million in  and million in of the decrease in from   was due to the sale of two commercial properties   was due to the refinancing of travelers land   was due to decreased variable rates and principal reductions and a  increase was due to the refinancing of apartments 
of the increase in from   was due to the purchase of five apartments in and million was due to the purchase of one parcel of unimproved land in the increase also was due to a  increase from a loan refinancing for a commercial property in this increase was offset by a decrease of  from the sale of three apartments in   from the sale of two commercial properties in  and  from the sale of two unimproved land parcels in a decrease of  was due to variable interest rates decreasing during for several of iori s variable rate notes 
advisory and net income fee paid to affiliate was  in  million in  and million in the decrease in from  was due to a decrease in gross assets

management believes it will continue to be successful in obtaining loan extensions and or refinancings 
management expects that funds from existing cash resources  selective sales of income producing properties  refinancing of real estate  and additional borrowings against real estate will be sufficient to meet iori s cash requirements associated with its current and anticipated level of operations  maturing debt obligations and existing commitments 
to the extent that iori s liquidity permits or financing sources are available  management intends to make new real estate investments 
iori owned a general partner interest in the tri city partnership

iori paid no dividends in and in december  the board of directors determined not to pay a fourth quarter dividend to holders of iori s common stock 
the non payment decision was based on the board determining that iori needed to retain cash for acquisitions that were anticipated in and that iori had no reit taxable income that required a distribution 
management does not plan to pay quarterly dividends for in  iori repurchased  shares of common stock in a private block purchase for a total of million 
management reviews the carrying values of iori s properties at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
impairment is considered to exist if the future cash flow from a property undiscounted and without interest is less than the carrying amount of the property 
if impairment is found to exist  a provision for loss is recorded by a charge against earnings 
the property review generally includes selective property inspections  discussions with the manager of the property and visits to selected properties in the area and a review of the property s current rents compared to market rents  the property s expenses  the property s maintenance requirements and the property s cash flows 
results of operations iori reported net income of million in  a net loss of million in and net income of million in fluctuations in these and the other components of revenue and expense are discussed in the following paragraphs

of the increase in from   was due to the purchase of five apartments in   was due to the increased utility  cleaning  repairs and insurance expense at iori s commercial properties and  was due to an increase in property taxes for iori s land 
property operations expense is expected to decrease in as iori selectively sells properties 
interest income was  in   in  and  in this increase was due to an increase in short term notes receivable which were paid off by the end of the decrease in from  was due to a decrease in short term investments  and from a million principal paydown received in may on iori s only note receivable 
interest income is expected to decrease as all of iori s notes have been paid off 
interest expense was million in  million in  and million in of the decrease in from   was due to the refinancing of travelers land  and  was due to lower variable interest rate and principal paydowns 
this decrease was offset by an increase of  due to the refinancing of the apartments 
of the increase in from   and million was due to the purchase of five apartments and one unimproved land parcel in  respectively  and  was due to one loan refinanced in the remaining decrease of  was due to lower variable interest rates at iori s apartment and commercial properties

depreciation expense in is expected to approximate advisory fee to affiliate was  in   in  and  in the change was due to changes in gross assets  the basis of the fee 
the advisory fee in is expected to decrease due to property sales in see note advisory agreement 
iori paid a net income fee of  in iori paid no net income fee in compared to million in the net income fee is based on of iori s net income 
general and administrative expense was million in   in  and million in the increase in from  was primarily due to an increase in director s and officer s insurance 
the decrease in from  was primarily due to a decrease in franchise taxes 
equity gains of partnerships was  in and equity losses were  in  and  in the increase in was due to dissolving of the tri city partnership 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at eton square office building

iori realized net income loss on discontinued operations of million   and  in  and the income loss relates to two properties that iori sold during the following table summarizes revenue and expense information for the properties sold 
revenue rental   property operations   expenses interest  depreciation net loss from discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate  equity in gain on sale of real estate by equity investees net income loss from discontinued operations  environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  iori may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other potential costs  relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property where property level managers have arranged for the removal  disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may seek recovery for personal injury associated with such materials 
management is not aware of any environmental liability relating to the above matters that would have a material adverse effect on iori s business  assets or results of operations 
inflation the effects of inflation on iori s operations are not quantifiable 
revenues from property operations tend to fluctuate proportionately with inflationary increases and decreases in housing costs 
fluctuations in the rate of inflation also affect the sales values of properties and the ultimate gain to be realized from property sales 
to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  earnings from short term investments and the cost of new financings as well as the cost of variable interest rate debt will be affected 
taxes for the years  and  iori elected and in the opinion of management qualified to be taxed as a reit as defined under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to continue to qualify for federal taxation as a reit  iori is required to hold at least of the value of its total assets in real estate assets  government securities  cash and cash equivalents at the close of each quarter of each taxable year 
as a reit  iori is also required to distribute at least in of its reit taxable income plus in of its net income from foreclosure property on an annual basis to stockholders 
due to the completion of the tender offer by ari on march   and the resulting concentration of ownership  iori no longer met the requirement for tax treatment as a reit as of january  iori cannot re qualify for tax treatment as a reit for at least five years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk iori s future operations  cash flow and fair values of financial instruments are partially dependent upon the then existing market interest rates and market equity prices 
market risk is the changes in the market rates and prices and the affect of the changes on future operations 
market risk is managed by matching the property s anticipated net operating income to an appropriate financing 
iori is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
iori does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets 
iori s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by iori s finance department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
iori s earnings are affected as changes in short term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt 
a large portion of iori s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings 
the impact on iori s financial statements of refinancing fixed debt that matured during was not material 
as permitted  management intends to convert a significant portion of variable rates borrowings to fixed rates in if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  iori s interest expense would increase and income would decrease by  this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on iori s borrowing cost 
this analysis did not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in iori s financial structure 
the following table contains only those exposures that existed at december  anticipation of exposures or risk on positions that could possibly arise was not considered 
iori s ultimate interest rate risk and its affect on operations will depend on future capital market exposures  which cannot be anticipated with a probable assurance level
