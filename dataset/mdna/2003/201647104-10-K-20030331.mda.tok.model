net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
net income for includes pre tax gains on the sales of available for sale securities totaling million and mortgage loans totaling million 
these net gains were substantially offset by the valuation adjustment losses totaling million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio incurred during the gains on the sales of mortgage loans were the result of the corporation taking advantage of pricing opportunities on its loans resulting from historically low interest rates and unprecedented loan demand during these low interest rates in significantly affected mortgage loan pay downs which in turn increased the amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights and impacted the valuation allowances for impairment losses of mortgage servicing rights 
results for also included the implementation of sfas no 
requiring that the amortization of goodwill cease beginning january  also under this statement  goodwill was evaluated for transitional impairment as of january   and thereafter must be evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the corporation performed the transitional valuation as of january   and the annual valuation as of october  no impairment loss was recognized as a result of the transitional or annual valuation tests

critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and disclosures included within this form k annual report  are based on the corporation s audited consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used  including the adequacy of allowances for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities where these values are not readily available from other sources as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for losses on loans the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements 
the first element is an allocated allowance established for specifically identified loans that are evaluated individually for impairment and are considered to be individually impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured by i the present value of expected future cash flows  ii the loan s obtainable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the primary method used by the corporation 
the second element is an estimated allowance established for impairment on each of the corporation s pools of outstanding loans 
see provision for loan losses in the md a and asset quality under item of this report for additional information 
these estimated allowances are based on several analysis factors including the corporation s past loss experience  economic and business conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay  geographic and industry concentrations  composition of the loan portfolio  credit quality and delinquency trends  regular examinations of specific problem loans by the corporation s credit review team  the overall portfolio quality and real estate market conditions in the corporation s lending areas  and known and inherent risks in each of the portfolios 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  while they are based on objective data delinquency trends  portfolio composition  loan grading and other data  it is the interpretation of that data by management that ultimately determines the estimate of the appropriate allowance 
additionally  while the allowance attempts to measure the impairment inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date  its adequacy will ultimately be dependent upon how conditions existing at the balance sheet date impact the loans in the future 
consequently  these estimates require revisions as more information becomes available 
a majority of the corporation s loans are collateralized by residential or commercial real estate 
therefore  the collectibility of such loans is susceptible to changes in prevailing real estate market conditions and other factors which can cause the fair value of the collateral to decline below the loan balance 
when the corporation records charge offs on these loans  it also begins the foreclosure process of taking possession of the real estate which served as collateral for such loans 
recoveries of loan charge offs occur when loan payments are received on the deficient loan in excess of the remaining recorded book balance of the loan 
upon foreclosure and conversion of the loan into real estate owned  the corporation may realize income as a component of real estate operations through the disposition of such real estate when the sale proceeds exceed the carrying value of the real estate 
although management believes that the corporation s allowance for loan losses is adequate to reflect the risk inherent in its loan portfolios  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience increases in its nonperforming assets  that it will not increase the level of its allowances in the future or that significant provisions for losses will not be required based on factors such as deterioration in market conditions  changes in borrowers financial conditions  delinquencies and defaults 
in addition  regulatory agencies review the adequacy of the allowance for losses on loans on a regular basis as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights are established based on the cost of acquiring the right to service mortgage loans or the allocated fair value of servicing rights retained on loans originated by the bank and subsequently sold in the secondary market 
these costs are initially capitalized and then amortized proportionately over the period based on the ratio of net servicing income received in the current period to total net servicing income projected to be realized from the mortgage servicing rights 
projected net servicing income is determined on the basis of the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio which decreases over time from scheduled loan amortization and prepayments 
the corporation estimates future prepayment rates based on relevant characteristics of the servicing portfolio  such as loan types  interest rate stratification and recent prepayment experience  as well as current interest rate levels  market forecasts and other economic conditions 
the corporation reports mortgage servicing rights at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows  using assumptions as to current market discount rates and loan prepayment speeds 
mortgage servicing rights are stratified by loan type and interest rate for purposes of impairment measurement 
loan types include fixed and adjustable rate government and conventional mortgage loans 
impairment losses are recognized to the extent the unamortized mortgage servicing rights for each stratum exceed the current fair value of that stratum 
impairment losses by stratum are recorded as reductions in the carrying value of the asset through a valuation allowance with a corresponding reduction to total other income 
individual allowances for each stratum are adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect changes in impairment 
valuation adjustments for impairment losses totaling   and  respectively  were recorded during the years ended december  and  and the six months ended december  valuation allowances totaling million  million and  respectively  were outstanding at december   and mortgage servicing rights totaled million at december   compared to million and million  respectively  at december  and as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of interest rates adversely affecting the value of mortgage servicing rights  the corporation uses interest rate floor agreements to protect the value of the mortgage servicing rights 
additionally  the corporation partially offsets reductions in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights through the recognition of gains on the sales of available for sale securities 
the determination of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is an important estimate 
since mortgage servicing rights are not quoted in an active market  management uses valuation models to estimate the fair value 
the corporation uses a software model to compute the fair value 
loan prepayment speeds are downloaded into the model from an independent market service and adjusted for geographic location and age of the loans 
the loan prepayment speed assumption weighs heavily in determining the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights 
on a quarterly basis  management of the corporation obtains an independent valuation report for comparison to their software model 
derivative financial instruments derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition and measured at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction referred to as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability referred to as a fair value hedge  any gain or loss associated with the derivative is reported in earnings along with the change in fair value of the asset or liability being hedged 
for a derivative not designated as a hedging instrument  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change 
on the date the corporation enters into a derivative contract  management must designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified cash flow exposure  fair value exposure or as a no hedging derivative 
proper documentation is a critical aspect pursuant to hedge accounting treatment 
the corporation formally documents all relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
in this documentation  the corporation specifically identifies the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
the corporation formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with its risk management policy 
the methods used to measure effectiveness vary depending on the hedging relationship 
the fair value of the corporation s derivatives is determined using various methods depending on the nature of the derivatives such as quotes obtained from independent pricing services  valuation models of independent pricing services with known factors put into the model  or software models utilizing assumptions or data obtained from independent sources 
segment reporting operating results by segment effective january   the corporation s operations were realigned into four lines of business operations for management reporting purposes 
these lines of business units are commercial banking  mortgage banking  retail banking and treasury 
see note segment information to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report for additional information on the corporation s lines of business including tabular results of operations for the years ended december  and the financial information presented does not necessarily represent the business unit s results of operations or financial condition as if they were independent companies 
results of operations for each business unit is derived from management s internal reporting system used to measure the performance of the segments and the corporation in total 
this management reporting system and the results of operations and financial condition by reported business unit are not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
commercial banking the commercial banking segment involves the origination of commercial operating  agricultural  commercial real estate  and small business loans  as well as indirect lending and commercial and residential construction loans 
also included in this segment is commercial demand and time deposits and cash management products and services 
the commercial banking segment reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net interest income increased million compared to the year ended december  this increase in net interest income is due primarily to the increase in the average balance of the commercial loan portfolio during over the provision for loan losses increased million for compared to this increase is due to the larger commercial loan portfolio compared to since the loss rate applied remained unchanged 
total other income decreased million for compared to during the year ended december   the corporation recorded an impairment loss totaling million on a residential master planned community development in nevada 
total other expense decreased million for compared to primarily due to the allocation of the net gain on exit costs and termination benefits for the year ended december  mortgage banking the mortgage banking segment involves the acquisition of a portion of correspondent  brokered and originated residential mortgage loans  the sale of these mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market and to the treasury segment  the servicing of mortgage loans  and the purchase and origination of rights to service mortgage loans 
the mortgage banking segment reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for  net interest income increased million compared to the year ended december  this increase in net interest income comparing the respective years is primarily due to increases in the credit the mortgage banking segment received in compared to from increases in its custodial cash earnings that were computed using an internal cost of funds rate 
the custodial cash earnings increased comparing over due to increases in escrow balances primarily from mortgage refinancing activity 
total other income increased million for compared to primarily due to net gains on the sales of warehouse loans partially offset by increases in amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights in over total other expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to due to the allocation of the net gain on exit costs and termination benefits totaling million for the year ended december  retail banking the retail banking segment involves a variety of traditional banking and financial services including the origination of residential mortgage loans through the bank s branch network and the sale of these mortgage loans to the treasury segment or the mortgage banking segment 
in addition  loan servicing is sold to the mortgage banking segment 
other core retail banking services include consumer checking  savings and certificates of deposit accounts regular and retirement  consumer loans for home equity  autos  secured and unsecured purposes  as well as credit cards  and other ancillary retail banking services including overdraft protection  electronic and telephone bill paying and cash advances 
also included in this segment are insurance and securities brokerage services 
the retail banking segment reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net interest income decreased million for compared to this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to lower rates on consumer loans comparing to the provision for loan losses increased million for compared to due to the changes in the retail banking segment s loan portfolio mix 
total other income increased million for compared to due to the increased retail fee pricing structure effective september   partially offset by decreases in commission revenues from brokerage operations 
total other expense increased million for compared to due to the allocation of the net gain on exit costs and termination benefits totaling million for the year ended december  treasury the treasury segment is responsible for managing corporate interest rate risk through asset and liability management strategies 
the treasury segment manages the corporation s single family residential mortgage loan portfolio  investment and mortgage backed securities  wholesale deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank and all other borrowings 
the treasury segment reported net income of million for year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  net interest income decreased million for compared to due primarily to the higher average balances of investment and mortgage backed securities for compared to with lower yields in and to higher average balances of borrowed funds partially offset by lower rates in over the provision for loan losses decreased million for compared to due to a lower balance of loans held in the treasury segment comparing the respective periods 
for the year ended december   total other income was a loss of million compared to a loss of million for this decrease in total other income is due primarily to valuation adjustments for impairment of the mortgage servicing rights totaling million recorded in compared to million recorded in total other expense for is a net credit of  compared to an expense of million for this net change is primarily due to higher loan production cost allocations in compared to consolidated results of operations comparison of consolidated results of operations net income for the year ended december   was million or per diluted share per basic share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share per basic share  for the year ended december  the corporation implemented sfas no 
as of january  see note intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report for the pro forma effect on operations for prior periods excluding goodwill amortization pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
the increase in net income for over is primarily due to an increase of million in net interest income and decreases of million in the amortization of intangible assets and million in the provision for loan losses 
these increases to net income were partially offset by an increase of million in general and administrative expenses 
net income for includes pre tax gains on the sales of available for sale securities totaling million and mortgage loans totaling million  compared to respective net gains of million and million for loan servicing fees  net of amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights  totaled million for compared to million for the decrease in these loan servicing fees resulted from the lower interest rates in which also effected the valuation allowances for impairment losses of mortgage servicing rights 
valuation adjustment losses totaling million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio were recorded during compared to million for the valuation adjustments are due to increases in loan prepayment speeds resulting from historically low interest rates 
net income for the calendar year ended december   was million  or per diluted share per basic share 
net income for includes million million after tax  or 
per diluted share in net gains relating to the august initiatives 
these net gains  recorded as a credit to the expense category exit costs and termination benefits  are due to the net gains realized on the sales of branches million pre tax partially offset by severance costs associated with right sizing branch personnel and expenses to close the branches million pre tax and expenses to exit leasing operations  pre tax 
the corporation also realized pre tax gains on the sales of available for sale securities totaling million 
these net gains on these sales were recognized primarily to offset the valuation adjustment losses totaling million in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio incurred during these valuation adjustments were due to an increase in loan prepayments resulting from a decrease in interest rates 
a net loss of million  or loss per basic and diluted share  was incurred for the six months ended december  included in the net loss for the six months ended december   is a loss of million 
per basic and diluted share from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefits of million  relating to the adoption of sfas no 
the net decrease in income comparing the six month period ending december   is due to net decreases in total other income of million and net interest income of million  and in net increases of million in the provision for loan losses  million in total other expense and million in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
these net decreases to income were partially offset by a net change of million in the income tax provision 
the net decrease in total other income included net losses on the sales of securities of million  losses on the termination of interest rate swap agreements of million and loss on the sale of securitized mortgage loans of million 
see ratios for certain performance ratios of the corporation for the years ended december  and  the six months ended december   and the fiscal year ended june  net interest income and interest rate spread net interest income for the year ended december   totaled million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
during and  the net interest rate spreads were and  respectively  an increase of basis points comparing years 
the net yield on interest earning assets was for compared to for  an increase of basis points 
the increase in the interest rate spread is due primarily to a basis point decrease in the rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield received on interest earning assets 
total interest expense decreased million comparing the year ended december   to december   primarily due to the lower cost of funds 
at the same time  comparing to  the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  primarily due to increases in fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaling million and million  respectively  partially offset by a decrease of million in certificates of deposit 
total interest income deceased million comparing to due to the lower yields on interest earning assets  even though the average balance of interest earning assets increased million over the same time periods 
net interest income increased for compared to due to i the lower interest rate environment in which costing liabilities have been repricing downward at a faster rate than earning assets have been repricing  ii the continued shift in the asset mix toward higher yielding commercial and consumer loans and iii a shift in funding from certificates of deposit primarily to fhlb advances and to checking accounts and money market accounts in the latter part of see note derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report for a discussion of the corporation s use of derivative financial instruments in managing its interest rate risk 
based on the current low interest rate environment  management anticipates a relatively stable interest rate spread through the first half of with a gradual decrease toward the end of calendar year however  the future trend in interest rate spreads and net interest income will be dependent upon and influenced by changes in and levels of both short term and long term market interest rates  and other factors such as the composition and size of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate risk exposure of the corporation and the maturity and repricing activity of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
for calendar year  net interest income totaled million  the interest rate spread was and the net yield on interest earning assets was 
as a comparison  the net interest rate spread and the net yield on interest earning assets were and  respectively  for the six months ended december  net interest income for was lower compared to the previous twelve month period ended december   due to the decrease of approximately million in the average net earnings balance 
the corporation s average balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities decreased in due mainly to the balance sheet restructuring completed during the six months ended december   and the corporation s repurchases of its common stock totaling million over the last twelve months 
the average balance of interest earning assets decreased million in compared to the twelve months ended december   and the average balance of interest bearing liabilities decreased million over the same period 
the increased interest rate spreads and net yield on interest earning assets was due to the lower interest rate environment in in which costing liabilities repriced downward at a faster rate than earning assets repriced and the continued shift in the asset mix toward higher yielding commercial and consumer loans 
net interest income totaled million for the six months ended december   compared to million for the six months ended december   a decrease of million  or 
during the six months ended december  and  interest rate spreads were and  respectively  a decrease of basis points 
the net yield on interest earning assets was and  a decrease of basis points over the respective periods 
net interest income decreased for the six months ended december   compared to  due to the compression of the interest rate spreads from the year rate increases by the federal reserve 
this compression in the net yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to the corporation s interest bearing liabilities repricing more quickly than the interest earning assets 
the decrease in the interest rate spread was due primarily to a basis point increase in costing liabilities as a result of the rise in short term interest rates comparing the respective six month periods and the liability sensitive balance sheet of the corporation 
total interest expense increased million comparing the six months ended december  to due to the higher costs of funds and a net increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income increased million over the same six month period with a net increase of million in average interest earning assets 
the increase in these average balances was due to net growth in the total loan portfolio million  primarily in residential mortgage loans and higher yielding commercial and construction loans 
the consumer loan portfolio also experienced moderate growth 
this loan growth was funded primarily with fhlb advances 
the average balance of advances from the fhlb and the weighted average rate paid on these advances increased million and basis points  respectively  comparing the six months ended december   to the six months ended december  the following table presents certain information concerning yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities during and at the end of each of the periods presented for the year ended december  six months ended december  for the year ended june  at december  at june  weighted average yield on loans mortgage backed securities investments interest earning assets weighted average rate paid on core deposits certificates of deposit advances from fhlb securities sold under agreements to repurchase other borrowings interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread net yield on interest earning assets core deposits consist of savings accounts  checking accounts and money market accounts

cash outlays on the purchases of swaption agreements  repurchases of common stock of the corporation and income tax payments over the last twelve months also contributed to this decrease 
the average net earnings balance decreased million during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the corporation repurchasing shares of its common stock at a cost of million during and the impact from the balance sheet restructuring 
the corporation s net earnings balance decreased by million during the six months ended december   compared to the six months ended december  this decrease in the net earnings balance comparing these periods is primarily due to the restructuring of the balance sheet  the repurchases of common stock of the corporation totaling million over the last twelve months and the funding of the million bank owned life insurance boli program

asset liability management the net interest income of the corporation is subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference  or mismatch  between the amount of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which mature or reprice in specified periods 
when interest rates change  to the extent the corporation s interest earning assets have longer maturities or effective repricing periods than its interest bearing liabilities  the interest income realized on the corporation s interest earning assets will adjust more slowly than the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities is commonly referred to as the gap 
a gap is considered positive when the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a specified period exceed the interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
similarly  during a period of declining interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
the corporation generally invests in interest earning assets that reprice more slowly than its interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatch exposes the corporation to interest rate risk 
in a rising rate environment  interest bearing liabilities will reprice faster than interest earning assets  thereby decreasing net interest income 
the corporation seeks to control its exposure to interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term assets such as commercial and consumer loans 
in addition  the corporation utilizes longer term advances from the fhlb to extend the repricing characteristics of its interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation also enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to lengthen synthetically its short term debt obligations 
in connection with its asset liability management program  the corporation has interest rate swap agreements with other counterparties under terms that provide for an exchange of interest payments on the outstanding notional amount of the swap agreement 
these agreements are primarily used to synthetically lengthen the maturity of certain deposit liabilities and fhlb advances 
in accordance with these arrangements the corporation pays fixed rates and receives variable rates of interest according to a specified index 
the corporation had swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion at december   compared to billion and billion  respectively at december  and for the years ended december  and  the six months ended december   and for the fiscal year ended  the corporation recorded million  million   and million  respectively  in net interest expense from its interest rate swap agreements 
the swap agreements outstanding as of december   have maturities ranging from may to march at december   the corporation has billion of year fixed rate fhlb advances with interest rates ranging from to  call dates ranging from january to march and maturity dates ranging from february to december the corporation entered into swaption agreements beginning in to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of the call options embedded in the fhlb advances 
all terms of the swaption agreements exactly match the terms of these fhlb advances 
in the event any of these fhlb advances are called  the corporation will exercise its corresponding option to enter into a swap agreement paying a fixed rate of interest and receiving a variable rate of interest

the following table represents management s projected maturity and repricing of the bank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and interest rate swap agreements presented which mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms and expected behavior over time of such assets  liabilities and interest rate swap agreements 
adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the period in which they are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
all loans and mortgage backed securities are adjusted for prepayment rates based on information provided by independent sources as of december   and the bank s historical prepayment experience 
fixed rate savings accounts  checking accounts and non indexed money market accounts are assumed to reprice or mature according to the decay rates defined by regulatory guidelines 
indexed money market accounts are deemed to reprice or mature within the day category

the bank s one year cumulative gap is a positive million  or  of the bank s total assets at december   compared to a negative million  or  of the bank s total assets at december   and a negative billion  or at december  the interest rate risk policy of the bank limits the liability sensitive one year cumulative gap not to exceed 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through analysis of the change in the net portfolio value npv 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  comprised of senior management  monitors the sensitivity of the value of the balance sheet to changes in market interest rates 
the primary purpose of the asset liability management function is to manage the corporation s combined portfolio such that its capital is leveraged effectively into assets and liabilities which maximize corporate profitability while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco and the board of directors review the interest rate risk position of the bank on a quarterly basis 
several measures are employed to determine the bank s exposure to interest rate risk 
market value sensitivity analysis measures the change in the bank s npv ratio in the event of sudden and sustained changes in market interest rates 
the npv ratio is defined as the market value of the bank s capital divided by the market value of its assets 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is used to compare the repricing characteristics of the bank s assets and liabilities 
finally  net interest income sensitivity analysis is used to measure the impact of changing interest rates on corporate earnings 
if estimated changes to the npv ratio and the sensitivity gap are not within the limits established by the board of directors  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
the corporation s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes a minimum allowable npv ratio generally over a range of hypothetical interest rates extending from basis points below current levels to basis points above current levels 
in addition  the policy establishes a maximum allowable change in the npv ratio of in the event of an instantaneous and adverse change in interest rates of basis points 
due to the current low interest rates in  the hypothetical changes in interest rates for the basis point decline and the basis point decline were not calculated since using such negative interest rate scenarios would yield meaningless results 
the ots monitors the bank s interest rate risk management procedures under guidelines set forth in thrift bulletin a 
this bulletin requires that the corporation s board of directors set interest rate risk limits that would prohibit the bank from exhibiting a post shock npv ratio and interest rate sensitivity measure of significant risk or greater  as defined by the ots 
the ots limits generally set a minimum npv ratio of at the basis points rate shock level  and a maximum change in npv ratio of at the same level 
alternately  the ots set a minimum npv ratio of at the basis point rate shock level and a maximum change in the npv ratio of at the same level 
finally  due to the low interest rate environment  ots limits have temporarily been removed from the down basis points test to a down basis points test 
the limits the corporation s board of directors has imposed on the bank are more conservative than the limits set by the ots 
the following table presents the projected change in the bank s npv ratio for various hypothetical rate shock levels as of december  hypothetical change in interest rates market value of capital market value of assets npv ratio minimum board limit change in npv ratio over base scenario board maximum allowable change dollars in thousands basis point rise n a basis point rise basis point rise n a base scenario n a basis point decline n a at december   the bank s npv ratios were within the targets set by the board of directors in all rate scenarios 
in addition  at december   the bank was within the limits set by the ots to maintain a risk rating of better than significant risk 
the npv ratio is calculated by the corporation pursuant to guidelines established by the ots 
the modeling calculation is based on the net present value of discounted estimated cash flows utilizing prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent sources as of december   with adjustments made to reflect the shift in interest rates as appropriate 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the collectibility of outstanding loans  which takes into consideration such factors as changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and economic conditions that affect the borrower s ability to pay  regular examinations of specific problem loans by the corporation s credit review team and of the overall portfolio quality and real estate market conditions in the corporation s lending areas 
management of the corporation believes that the present level of allowance for loan losses is adequate to reflect the risks inherent in its portfolios 
however  there can be no assurance that the corporation will not experience increases in its nonperforming assets  that it will not increase the level of its allowance in the future or that significant provisions for losses will not be required based on factors such as deterioration in market conditions  changes in borrowers financial conditions  delinquencies and defaults 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two elements 
the first element is an allocated allowance established for specifically identified loans that are evaluated individually for impairment and are considered to be individually impaired 
the second element is an estimated allowance established for impairment on each of the corporation s pools of outstanding loans 
these estimated allowances are based on several analysis factors including the corporation s past loss experience  general economic and business conditions  geographic and industry concentrations  credit quality and delinquency trends  and known and inherent risks in each of the portfolios 
these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require frequent revisions as more information becomes available 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   or of total nonperforming loans  compared to million  or at december  and million  or at december  the corporation recorded loan loss provisions totaling million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease in loan loss provision is due to lower performing loans and a decrease in the loan portfolio 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses increased to million  or of loans  at december  from million  or of loans  at december  the nonperforming assets to total assets ratio and nonperforming loans to total loans ratio both improved at december  compared to december  due to the decrease in nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans at december   compared to december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans is a result of the shift in the portfolio mix from residential mortgage lending to commercial real estate and consumer lending which has a greater risk factor and requires a higher allowance on the corporation s portfolio 
net loans charged off totaled million and million in and  respectively 
this increase is due primarily to increases in charge offs of commercial real estate loans  construction loans and commercial operating loans totaling million  million and  respectively  partially offset by decreases in agricultural loans and consumer loans totaling million and million  respectively 
the corporation recorded provision for loan losses totaling million for the year ended december  the total allowance for loan losses increased to million  or of loans  at december   compared to million  or 
of loans  at december  a significant reason for this increase in the allowance is due to the negative impact on the ability of borrowers to pay their loans attributable to the recessionary economic conditions present in the second half of and the continued deterioration in the economy 
this is reflected in the increasing ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and nonperforming assets to total assets  as well as the increase in total nonperforming asset balances 
the corporation recorded loan loss provisions of million and million for the six months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to management s evaluation of the corporation s portfolio credit risk and subsequent decision to increase reserves by million from june   to december   based on changing economic conditions and increases in nonperforming loans during the last half of the total allowance for loan losses increased to million  or 
of loans  at december   compared to million  or 
of loans  at june  this increase was due to the additional loan loss provisions recorded during the six months ended december  net loans charged off totaled million for the six month period in compared to million for the period 
net charge offs were higher for the period due to increases in lease charge offs million and commercial real estate loan charge offs million 
the increase in lease charge offs is primarily due to credit issues on the retained portfolio 
the increase in the commercial real estate loan charge offs is due primarily to a charge off totaling million on an office building in kansas and  on an apartment building in nebraska 
the corporation s real estate loan portfolio is primarily secured by properties located within its branch market area 
at december   the residential loan portfolio totaled billion and is secured by properties located primarily in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas

at december   the commercial real estate portfolio totaled billion and was secured by properties located primarily in colorado  iowa and kansas 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio at december   totaling billion was secured by properties primarily located in colorado  iowa and kansas 
at june   commercial real estate loans totaled billion and were secured by properties located primarily in colorado  iowa and kansas 
nonperforming assets are monitored on a regular basis by the corporation s internal credit review and problem asset groups 
nonperforming assets at december are summarized as follows dollars in thousands nonperforming loans residential real estate commercial real estate consumer and other loans leases total real estate commercial residential total troubled debt restructurings commercial residential total total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans nonperforming assets to total assets total allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses to total loans total nonperforming assets total nonperforming loans nonresidential nonperforming assets nonperforming loans consist of nonaccruing loans loans days or more past due and accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more 
at december   and  there were no accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
nonperforming residential real estate loans at december  and  have been restated due to a change in determining past due loans 
during  the corporation changed its method of determining delinquent residential real estate loans to a method where the number of days past due are determined by the number of contractually delinquent loan payments 
previous to this change  the corporation utilized a methodology where the loan system converted monthly loan payments missed on a loan to days past due 
this change in determining these delinquent loans conforms the corporation s reporting with the bank s regulatory thrift financial reporting 
this change in methods reduced nonperforming residential real estate loans previously reported by million and million  respectively  at december  and real estate consists of commercial and residential property acquired through foreclosure or repossession real estate owned and real estate in judgment and real estate from certain subsidiary operations  and does not include performing real estate held for investment totaling million  and million and million  respectively  at december   and a troubled debt restructuring is a loan on which the corporation  for reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the debtor that the corporation would not otherwise consider 
the concession could be a reduction in the loan s interest rate  a reduction in the face amount of the debt  or an extension of the maturity date of the loan 
nonperforming loans at december  decreased by million compared to december   due primarily to decreases in commercial real estate delinquencies totaling million and residential delinquencies totaling million 
the decrease in commercial real estate delinquencies is primarily due to the foreclosure of a loan totaling million and the charge off of a group of related loans totaling million partially offset by the addition of four loans totaling million 
these decreases in nonperforming loans were partially offset by increases in residential construction delinquencies totaling million  commercial construction delinquencies totaling  commercial operating delinquencies totaling  and consumer delinquencies totaling  the increase in residential construction delinquencies is primarily due to one loan totaling million 
the higher concentration levels of nonperforming loans at december   were secured by properties located in iowa  oklahoma and kansas 
this compares to december   with nonperforming loans secured by properties located in kansas  nevada  and iowa 
nonperforming loans at december   decreased  compared to december   due primarily to the foreclosure of a construction loan totaling million which moved to the real estate category and a decrease of million in leases 
these decreases were offset by two commercial real estate groups of loans totaling million going days past due and general increases totaling million in the residential real estate portfolio 
the million construction loan foreclosure was on a property located in nevada for the development of a residential master planned community 
the million decrease in leases reflects the corporation s sale of a substantial portion of this portfolio during the first quarter of real estate owned decreased million at december  compared to december  due primarily to the sale of a commercial construction property totaling million 
real estate owned at december   increased million from december   due primarily to the addition of the residential master planned community development property located in nevada 
the book value of this property totaled million at december  real estate owned at december   is located primarily in nevada  iowa and missouri compared to december   where the higher concentrations were located primarily in nevada  missouri and arizona 
at december   the higher concentrations were located primarily in kansas and missouri 
troubled debt restructurings decreased million at december   compared to december   due primarily to the reclassification of seven loans totaling million from troubled debt restructuring status to current loan status 
troubled debt restructurings decreased million at december   compared to december   due primarily to the charge off of one loan totaling  and the reclassification of another loan for  from troubled debt restructuring status to current loan status 
non interest income retail fees and charges retail fees and charges totaled million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and the primary source of this fee income is customer charges for retail financial services such as checking account fees and service charges  charges for insufficient checks or uncollected funds  stop payment fees  debit card annual fees  overdraft protection fees  transaction fees for personal checking  interchange revenue from use of debit and credit cards and automatic teller machine services 
the reason for the increase over is due to an increased retail pricing structure effective september   debit card annual fees and to an increase in the number of checking accounts 
retail fees and charges totaled million and million  respectively  for the six months ended december  and the net increase for the six months ended december   compared to was due to increases in fees for overdraft and insufficient funds charges on checking accounts and debit card fees 
loan servicing fees and mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment the major components of loan servicing fees for the periods indicated and the amount of loans serviced for other institutions are as follows year ended december  six months ended december  year ended june  in thousands revenue from loan servicing fees revenue from late loan payment fees amortization of mortgage servicing rights loan servicing fees  net valuation adjustment for impairment loans serviced for other institutions at period end the amount of revenue generated from loan servicing fees  and changes in comparing periods  is primarily due to the average size of the corporation s portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for other institutions and the level of rates for service fees collected 
revenue from loan servicing fees is reduced by the amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights and  as necessary  adjusted for changes to the valuation allowance for impairment 
the loan servicing fees category also includes fees collected for late loan payments 
the fair value of the corporation s loan servicing portfolio decreases as mortgage interest rates decline and loan prepayments increase 
in such an environment  it is expected that income generated from the corporation s loan servicing portfolio would decrease 
however  this negative effect on the corporation s income would be offset  in part  by an increase in additional servicing fee income attributable to new loan originations  which historically increase in periods of lower  or declining  mortgage interest rates 
conversely  the value of the corporation s loan servicing portfolio would increase as mortgage interest rates rise 
the net decrease in revenue from loan servicing comparing the year ended december  to is due to a lower level of service fee rates comparing the respective years slightly offset by a higher average balance of mortgage loans serviced 
the average service fee rate collected by the corporation was 
for the year ended december   compared to 
for the year ended december  the mortgage loans serviced for other institutions increased at december   compared to december   due to the purchases of loan servicing portfolios in totaling billion 
the increase in amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights during compared to reflects an increase in loan prepayments due to the lower interest rate environment comparing the respective years 
the amount of amortization expense of mortgage servicing rights is determined  in part  by the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan servicing portfolio which is impacted by the rate of mortgage loan pay downs 
in addition  since mortgage servicing rights are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value  valuation adjustments in impairment losses totaling million and million  respectively  were recorded during the years ended december  and changes in the valuation allowances are due to increases or decreases in estimated loan prepayment speeds resulting from changes in interest rates 
at december   the valuation allowance on the mortgage servicing rights portfolio totaled million compared to million at december  the average service fee rate collected by the corporation was 
for the six months ended december   compared to 
for the fiscal year ended june  a valuation adjustment totaling  was recorded during the six months ended december   as a reduction of loan servicing fees and of the carrying amount of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
the mortgage loans serviced for other institutions increased at december   compared to june   due to the billion of residential loans securitized and sold in november with servicing retained
