management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of republic bancorp  inc republic or the company analyzes the major elements of republic s balance sheets and statements of income 
republic  a bank holding company headquartered in louisville  kentucky  is the parent of republic bank trust company and republic bank trust company of indiana collectively bank 
this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
this discussion includes various forward looking statements with respect to credit quality including but not limited to delinquency trends and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  corporate objectives  the company s interest rate sensitivity model and other financial and business matters 
when used in this discussion the words anticipate  project  expect  believe  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
republic cautions that these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties  all of which may change over time 
actual results could differ materially from forward looking statements 
in addition to factors disclosed by republic elsewhere in this annual report  the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements pricing pressures on loan and deposit products  competition  changes in economic conditions both nationally and in the bank s markets  the extent and timing of actions of the federal reserve board  market acceptance of the bank s products and services  and  the extent and timing of legislative or regulatory actions and reforms 
highlights republic reported another solid year of earnings during as net income reached million during the year compared to million for  an increase of 
diluted earnings per class a common shares increased to for the year 
on a percentage basis  the increase in diluted earnings per class a common shares increased less than net income primarily due to the conversion of republic s guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in the company s subordinated debentures 
the rise in earnings for was primarily attributable to increased net interest income  increased income associated with the company s tax refund processing subsidiary refunds now  gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market  and service charges on deposits 
republic s book value per common share  exclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income  increased from at december  to per share at december  following is a brief description of a few company highlights during net interest income grew during the year as a further decline in short term market interest rates led to a continued downward repricing in the company s short term interest bearing liabilities 
republic also continued its strategy initiated in of extending maturities on advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb in order to mitigate the risk of future increases in market interest rates 
republic reported another strong year in its mortgage banking operations as favorable long term market interest rates  coupled with the company s promotion of its maximum closing costs product  led to strong gains on the sale of family  fixed rate residential real estate loans into the secondary market 
refunds now reported record earnings during due to a substantial increase in transaction volume related to new sales 
overall  the number of tax preparers serviced by refunds now increased during compared to the number serviced in service charges on deposit accounts grew significantly during the year as the company added approximately  new checking accounts 
a large number of these new accounts were added in conjunction with the company s promotion of its maximum closing cost  fixed rate mortgage product  which requires a primary checking account to receive the favorable closing cost rate 
the bank s overdraft honor program also played a positive role in the overall increase in service charges on deposits during loans increased million as republic retained approximately million in fixed rate  year residential real estate loans  which the company has traditionally sold into the secondary market 
republic also experienced a million increase in home equity loans outstanding as the company added  new home equity lines of credit during these new lines of credit were added primarily from cross selling opportunities in conjunction with the company s maximum closing cost  fixed rate mortgage product 
the company entered into two new arrangements to provide deferred deposit services in at least two additional states  beginning in december 
management believes these transactions could become a meaningful component of the company s overall profitability over the next few years 
republic opened three new banking centers during and announced plans for an additional six banking centers to be opened in as the company continued to take advantage of opportunities to increase market share as a consequence of the recent sale of two kentucky based community bank competitors 
net income for the year was million  up million over the same period in earnings per class a common share increased from at december  to for the year republic s increased earnings were primarily due to increases in net interest income  service charges on deposit accounts and gain on sale of loans into the secondary market 
the following table summarizes selected financial information regarding republic s financial performance table summary years ended december  dollars in thousands net income diluted class a earnings per share return on average assets roa return on average equity roe critical accounting policies and estimates republic s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods 
management continually evaluates the company s accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from regulators and third party professionals and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
republic believes its critical accounting policies and estimates include the valuation of the allowance for loan losses 
based on management s calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was an adequate estimate of losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million during if the mix and amount of future write off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially affected 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses and a detailed description of the methodology management uses in determining the adequacy of the allowance see titled allowance and provision for loan losses in this annual report 
deferred deposit transactions deferred deposits are transactions in which a customer typically receives a cash advance against his or her next paycheck in exchange for a postdated check for the advanced amount plus a fixed fee 
the advance provider agrees to delay presentment of the check for payment until the advance due date  generally about two weeks from the advance date 
on or before the advance due date the customer can present cash in person for the amount of the advance plus a fee and receive his postdated check in return 
if the customer does not return to reclaim his check by the advance due date  the check is deposited 
the company has been conducting a deferred deposit transaction business  in conjunction with third party originators  on a limited basis since august the company recently entered into two new contracts with third party originators and service providers in order to significantly expand its deferred deposit transaction business 
the company s total deferred deposit outstandings averaged under  during management projects these outstandings could reach or exceed million by the end of the first quarter of  although one of the company s third party originators is entering a new territory  and depending upon its success  outstandings originated through this relationship may exceed these projections 
based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these transactions are recorded as loans on the company s financial statements and the corresponding fees are recorded as a component of interest income on loans 
the third parties with whom the company does business have at times experienced legal and or regulatory obstacles in some states in which they do business 
these obstacles have included  without limitation  litigation and government enforcement actions 
in some states  laws have been enacted or amended to prohibit or limit their ability to conduct business without a financial institution partner 
in addition  the comptroller of the currency has effectively prohibited national banks from conducting this business 
this has provided opportunities for state chartered commercial banks to enter the business and earn additional income with minimal capital outlays 
the legal and regulatory climate for this product continues to change 
in january  the fdic issued draft guidance on examinations of bank deferred deposit activities which the fdic characterizes as presenting substantial credit risks for lenders  as well as increased transaction  legal and reputation risks when a third party arrangement is used 
the fdic draft guidance proposes  among other items  that banks hold significantly more capital than would be required for other subprime type loans  perhaps as much as of deferred deposit transactions outstanding  that allowances for loan and lease losses be adequate and take into account that many such transactions remain outstanding beyond their initial term due to roll overs  that deferred deposit transactions be classified substandard  and that transactions that have been outstanding for more than days generally be classified as loss 
the draft guidance also proposes limits on the ability of a borrower to renew or roll over a deferred deposit transaction and on the number of transactions that can be made to a customer within a given period of time 
the draft guidance requires examiners to assess the bank s risk management program for third party marketing and servicing relationships  including the bank s due diligence process for selecting a third party marketing and servicing provider and its monitoring of the third party s activities and performance  and to closely scrutinize the bank s compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
the company believes that it has adequately considered and addressed the risks associated with its deferred deposit transaction business  including the risks addressed in the fdic draft examination guidelines  and that the company s size  technological resources and experience in the successful management of non traditional product lines  among other factors  will enable the company to effectively manage and control its participation in the deferred deposit transaction business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fdic or others will not impose additional limitations on or prohibit insured banks from engaging altogether in deferred deposit transactions  or that the bank s ability to continue to engage in the business profitably or at all will not be negatively impacted by compliance with applicable laws  regulations and guidelines 
refunds now refunds now is a tax refund processing service for taxpayers receiving both federal and state tax refunds through a nationwide network of tax preparers 
refund anticipation loans rals are made to taxpayers filing income tax returns electronically 
the rals are repaid by the taxpayer when the taxpayer s refunds are electronically received by the bank from governmental taxing authorities 
based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  fees from rals are included as a component of interest income on loans 
refunds now also provides electronic refund checks ercs to taxpayers 
after receiving refunds electronically from governmental taxing authorities  checks are issued to taxpayers for the amount of their refund  less fees 
fees on ercs are included in non interest income 
ral fees  net of tax preparer rebates  were million in compared to million in and million in erc fees  net of tax preparer rebates  were million in compared to million in and million in the rise in fee income was the result of an increase in volume as total tax offices serviced by refunds now increased during the tax season compared to the tax season 
while the transaction volume is primarily a first quarter event  the tax preparer contracts are actively solicited by the refunds now sales force throughout the year the coming tax filing season 
republic anticipates that its track record of increased product volume from refunds now will continue in  however  management s projections of losses from rals remain difficult to predict due primarily to the significant reliance by the company on third party government information used to underwrite rals

results of operations net interest income the principal source of republic s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as market interest rates 
for  net interest income was million  up million over the million attained during republic was primarily able to increase its net interest income through balance sheet growth  particularly through growth in mortgage backed securities and loans 
for further analysis see section titled volume rate variance analysis of this annual report 
while the loan portfolio decreased slightly during the first six months of  the company experienced strong growth in the loan portfolio during the last six months of  principally in residential real estate loans  commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit 
cash received during from the sale of loans into the secondary market as well as sales  calls and prepayments on investment securities was reinvested by the company into mortgage backed security products 
the increases in the balances of loans and mortgage backed securities were the significant factors in the company s overall increase in net interest income comparing to although  net interest income was higher during compared to  continued downward repricing of the bank s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio and the early prepayment of higher yielding portfolio loans without a corresponding dollar for dollar downward repricing of the bank s interest bearing liabilities during the year limited the company s ability to increase net interest income through changes in rate 
as a result  management elected to retain million in fixed rate  year residential real estate loans beginning in october the company funded these loans through fhlb advances with million borrowed on an overnight basis and the remaining million borrowed with terms of two to six years 
management anticipates earning an approximate spread of during the first year of this transaction  which will positively affect the company s net interest income but will negatively impact the company s net interest spread and net interest margin 
the company also sold approximately million in mortgage backed investment securities and cmos during in anticipation of rapid prepayments due to declining long term market interest rates 
these securities had a bond equivalent yield of at the time of sale 
as an additional response to declining long term market interest rates and to reduce future borrowing costs  republic prepaid a million advance from the federal home loan bank with a coupon of 
management anticipates an overall positive effect on net interest income over the next twelve months as a result of these transactions 
republic s increase in net interest income resulting from changes in volume during occurred primarily from growth in the loan portfolio during the latter half of  as well as an increase in rals during the tax season 
republic also experienced an increase of approximately million in the average outstandings of loans available for sale during  which are included as a part of total loans on the average balance sheet and volume rate analyses 
on the liability side  republic pursued a strategy during of extending maturities  primarily through advances at the federal home loan bank  and not actively pursuing higher cost certificates of deposit 
this strategy resulted in many of the bank s clients electing to move maturing cd s into short term  interest bearing money market cd accounts in anticipation of future interest rate increases 
as a result  the change in interest expense due to volume was only a slight increase as the reduction in cd s was offset by the increase in the money market certificate of deposit accounts  along with other borrowings 
the increase in net interest income resulting from changes in rate during occurred as the federal reserve decreased short term interest rates throughout the year 
all categories of interest income experienced a reduction due to rate and primarily all categories of interest expense experienced a reduction due to rate as well 
because republic s interest bearing liabilities generally have a shorter repricing frequency than its interest earning assets  the overall effect to the company was an increase in net interest income due to an improved spread

total overdraft fees increased from million in to million in while the total number of accounts eligible for the overdraft honor program increased to  at december  additionally  the company s total number of customer checking accounts  exclusive of commercial accounts  increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in the number of retail checking accounts was primarily attributable to the success of the company s maximum closing costs  secondary market loan product  which requires a primary checking account in order for the customer to receive the discounted closing fees 
the continued success of the program could significantly impact the growth of the company s checking account base in the future 
in addition  the increase in the company s checking account base is also positively affected by the number of new banking centers  direct mail solicitations and other marketing initiatives 
republic opened three new banking centers in and announced plans for six new banking centers to be opened during  which should positively affect the number of customer checking accounts 
the factors listed in the preceding paragraph that resulted in the increase in the number of customer checking accounts during are the same or similar to the factors which resulted in the increase of customer checking accounts during service charges on deposits during were positively affected by the company s promotion and the overdraft honor program 
overdraft related fees increased million during as the company added over  new customer retail checking accounts during the year 
at december  the bank had nearly  accounts eligible for the overdraft honor program 
electronic refund check erc fees  which are substantially received during the first quarter of the year increased million for compared to this increase was due primarily to a large increase in overall erc volume compared to the prior year resulting from successful marketing efforts during the company also experienced significant growth in erc fees during compared to due primarily to the same circumstances 
for further information see section titled refunds now of this annual report 
title insurance commissions increased  for the year ended december   compared to the same period in title insurance commissions are earned when title insurance policies are sold to clients on newly originated real estate secured loans 
since a substantial portion of these commissions is earned on policies relating to family  secondary market real estate loans  the income closely correlates to secondary market loan origination volume  which was million during compared to million during management anticipates that title insurance commissions will stay at or near current levels during the first quarter of  given the amount of secondary market loans in process at year end title insurance commissions increased million for over because the bank first began offering this product on july   the amount reflects only six months of activity 
as a result  title insurance commissions for reflect a significant increase over the large volume of refinance activity in family  secondary market real estate loans during also contributed to the increase for the year 
net gain on sale of loans increased  during to million 
further reductions in long term market interest rates during resulted in an increase in consumer refinance activity for the year 
as a percentage of loans sold  net gains decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gains as a percentage of loans sold was primarily attributable to a management decision to offer more attractive pricing on its fixed rate  residential real estate products in order to gain market share 
while attractive pricing reduces the company s gains on its sold loans  management believes that the ability to cross sell other bank products to customers of its residential real estate products will improve the company s long term profitability 
the company potentially could have achieved higher gains as a percentage of loans sold with a risk of lower origination volume by offering less attractive pricing to its loan customers 
the company has also traditionally sold the vast majority of its loans servicing released and has been cautious of retaining large amounts of servicing due to the market volatility of the value of the servicing portfolio caused by the potential for rapid prepayments in a declining market interest rate environment 
management anticipates that origination volume of secondary market loans in the first quarter of will likely remain at or above the record level achieved during  however  an increase in long term interest rates during the year could have a significant negative impact on secondary market origination volume 
on july   republic became subject to new accounting guidance for certain commitments to originate loans 
the new guidance requires loan commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans held for sale to be accounted for as derivative instruments 
to offset the interest rate risk of these loan commitments  republic enters into forward agreements to sell loans for corresponding amounts and terms  which are also considered derivatives 
because the fair value of the loan commitment and sales agreement derivatives substantially offset the impact of adopting this guidance was not material and substantially all of the gain on sale generated from mortgage banking activities is recorded when closed loans are delivered into the sales agreements 
net gain on sale of loans increased during as declining market interest rates prompted an increase in consumer refinance activity of family  fixed rate residential loans 
revenue from mortgage banking activities  principally gains on sale of loans  increased as a result of higher secondary market sales volume 
as a percentage of loans sold  net gains on sale decreased to in compared to in this reduction was due primarily to the promotional mortgage loan product that reduced the amount of fees charged to the client 
although the reduced fees lowered the net margin on average loan sales  the promotional program generated significant origination volume 
overall  the bank originated million in mortgage loans held for sale during compared to million during net gain on sale of securities was million for compared to million during with a loss of  in management elected to sell million of the company s mortgage backed securities during to mitigate the risk of prepayment of these securities 
for further discussion see section titled investment securities in this annual report 
a declining interest rate environment during led to a positive change in the market value of the available for sale securities portfolio with an increase in the risk of prepayment on certain mortgage backed products 
as a result  management elected to sell a large amount of mortgage backed securities during republic received proceeds of million on securities available for sale during resulting in overall gains of approximately million 
republic also had million in securities that were called during resulting in recognized gains of an additional interchange fee income from the company s debit card product increased  during to million and  during to million 
debit card fee income is generated from interchange fees paid for usage by the company s customers 
the rise in income was due substantially to an increase in the company s checking account base  which is the primary source of debit card customers 
in addition  the company actively promoted its customers use of the debit card through various marketing promotions throughout and non interest expense table analysis of non interest expense year ended december  percent increase decrease dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment communication and transportation marketing and development bankshares tax supplies fhlb prepayment penalty nm outsourced technology services other total nm not meaningful the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily attributable to annual merit increases and associated incentive compensation accruals  additional seasonal staff at refunds now and a modest increase to staff to support secondary market origination volume 
the company also experienced increased staffing and occupancy expenses in association with the opening of three new banking centers during overall  total full time equivalent employees ftes increased to at december  from at december  management expects a continued increase in salary and occupancy expenses over the next year due to the planned opening of at least six new banking centers during with the potential for additional locations under active  ongoing review 
similar to  salary and employee benefits also increased for the increase was attributable to annual merit increases and associated incentive compensation accruals  additions to senior level commercial lending and cash management professional sales staff  additions to staff and overtime at refunds now and a significant addition to staff and overtime to support the strong secondary market loan origination volume during the year 
total ftes increased to at december  from at december  the company and its principal bank subsidiary do not pay a state income tax in kentucky  however  a tax is assessed by the state based on average equity over the previous five years 
republic bank trust company also pays a deposit tax to the various municipalities in which it is located based on total deposits at that location as of june th of each year 
both of these taxes are classified as bankshares tax on the company s financial statements 
this category increased for both and due to growth in deposits  as well as an increase in republic bank trust company s average five year equity 
the growth in average five year equity resulted primarily from earnings and the proceeds generated by the company s initial public offering in july the company recognized prepayment penalties of million and million on the early termination of advances from the federal home loan bank during and  respectively 
the company elected to incur these penalties in order to refinance a portion of its advances from the federal home loan bank into lower cost borrowings with extended maturities  taking advantage of the favorable interest rate environment at the time

outsourced technology services represents expenses incurred by the company for third party processing of merchant credit card transactions for a large cash management client  website hosting for republicbank

this category increased for compared to the increase was attributable to higher rates paid by the company for merchant credit card processing 
the company also had higher fees for its website hosting due to an increase in the number of clients utilizing republicbank

in august the company began utilizing a third party wire system in order to maximize the efficiency and security of the bank s wire transfer services 
as a result  the company incurred additional expense for five months during compared to months during other expenses decreased  during compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to legal expenses associated with certain patent litigation at refunds now which the company incurred during this litigation was settled during for further discussion  see part ii  item  legal proceedings of the form k 
financial condition loan portfolio net loans  primarily consisting of secured real estate loans  increased by million to billion at december  commercial real estate loans are concentrated primarily within the bank s existing markets  and are principally comprised of loans secured by multi family investment properties  single family developments  medical facilities  small business owner occupied offices  retail properties and  to a lesser extent  golf courses 
these loans typically have interest rates that are initially fixed for one to seven years with the remainder of the loan term subject to repricing based on various market indices 
in order to reduce the negative effect of refinance activity within the portfolio during a declining interest rate environment  the company requires an early termination penalty on substantially all commercial real estate loans for a portion of the fixed term period 
overall  commercial real estate loans increased million from december  republic maintained its strict underwriting standards  which includes personal guarantees on substantially all commercial real estate loans  and pricing requirements during despite competitive pressures in both areas 
as a result  the commercial real estate portfolio experienced modest growth compared to prior years 
management anticipates offering a reduced closing costs commercial real estate product during and plans to aggressively market this product through various media outlets  while maintaining its traditional underwriting standards 
similar to commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans typically have fixed interest rate periods of one to seven years with the remainder of the loan term subject to repricing based on various market indices 
these loans also carry an early termination penalty during a portion of their fixed rate periods in order to lessen the overall negative effect to the company of refinancings in a declining interest rate environment 
despite early termination penalties on many of its portfolio residential real estate loans  the company continued to experience a high level of refinance activity into fixed rate secondary market products during overall  residential real estate loans increased by a modest million during responding to the high level of refinance activity within the portfolio  management elected to hold million of year  fixed rate secondary market eligible loans within the company s portfolio during the fourth quarter of to mitigate the interest rate risk  the company borrowed million in fhlb advances with laddered maturities to fund these loans 
subject to favorable market conditions  the company may once again elect to hold a portion of its year  fixed rate loan originations during with matched funding from the federal home loan bank 
the company also continued to moderate the pricing of its family adjustable rate portfolio loan products during in an effort to maintain its residential real estate outstandings 
the consumer loan portfolio principally consists of various short term  unsecured loans to individual clients 
also included in this category are deferred deposit transactions  which are considered loans under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company had approximately million in deferred deposit transactions outstanding at december   and expects this balance to steadily increase throughout for further discussion  see section titled deferred deposit transactions of this annual report 
home equity loans increased million during to million 
the rise in outstandings was primarily the result of increased cross sale opportunities in conjunction with the origination of fixed rate secondary market loan products as part of the company s partnership package 
as part of the partnership package  the company s fixed rate  secondary market loan clients are routinely approved for a home equity line of credit 
as a result  the company opened approximately  new home equity lines of credit during at december   republic clients had million of home equity lines of credit available for use

management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and regularly presents and discusses the analysis with the board of directors 
management estimates the allowance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  economic conditions  regulatory guidance and other factors 
while management estimates the allowance for loan losses  in part  based on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance due to the fact that the company only began actively pursuing commercial real estate loans within the last five years 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that may be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management deems a loan uncollectible 
management makes allocations within the allowance for specifically classified loans regardless of loan amount  collateral or loan type 
loans that are past due days or more and that are not specifically classified are uniformly assigned a risk weighted percentage ranging from to of the loan balance based upon loan type 
management evaluates the remaining loan portfolio by utilizing the historical loss rate for each respective loan type 
both an average five year loss rate and a loss rate based on heavier weighting of the previous two years loss experience are utilized in the analysis 
specialized loan categories are evaluated by utilizing subjective factors in addition to a historical loss calculation to determine a loss allocation for each of those types 
because this analysis or any similar analysis is an imprecise measure of loss  the allowance is typically subject to additional adjustments 
therefore  management will also take into account other significant factors as may be necessary or prudent in order to reflect  properly  potential losses in the total loan portfolio 
the total allowance for loan losses increased million from december  to million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses was due to growth in commercial real estate lending  an overall change in the product mix within the loan portfolios including growth in deferred deposit transactions  and to account for the modest increase in non performing loans 
management believes  based on information presently available  that it has adequately provided for loan losses at december  management continues to closely monitor the commercial real estate loan portfolio in particular  recognizing that commercial real estate loans generally carry a greater risk of loss than residential real estate loans 
similar to  the company experienced a modest provision for loan losses during the year of for the twelve months ended december   the provision for loan losses was million compared to million during the year of included in the provision for loan losses were thousand and million for refund anticipation loans rals during and  respectively 
the substantial decrease in losses associated with rals during was primarily the result of a significant reduction of errors in information received from government entities  which is used to underwrite rals 
the company also received better than expected cross collection of prior year losses 
this is largely due to the unusually high charge offs experienced during that in turn led to increased recovery opportunities during the tax season 
management does not believe  however  that this low loss rate can be sustained in future periods and expects a loss rate in closer to historical percentages 
the provision for loan losses was million during compared to million during the higher provision for loan losses in was primarily attributable to an increase in losses associated with the higher volume of rals at refunds now as well as an increase in losses in the family residential and commercial real estate portfolios

allowance allocation is based on management s assessment of economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

when loans are placed on non accrual status  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
these loans remain on non accrual status until the borrower demonstrates the ability to remain current or the loan is deemed uncollectible and is charged off 
consumer loans are not placed on non accrual status but are reviewed periodically and charged off when they reach days past due or earlier if they are deemed uncollectible 
at december   republic had  in consumer loans days or more past due compared to  at december  the bank s level of delinquent loans decreased to at december   down from at december  the improvement is primarily attributable to a small number of real estate secured loans that reached maturity and were pending refinance by the company or another financial institution at december  a majority of these loans were either paid off by the borrower or refinanced by the company during  thus resolving their prior past due status 
republic experienced an increase in total non performing loans from million at december  to million at december  the increase in non accrual loans was spread across all major real estate secured lending categories 
the increase in loans past due days or more was primarily attributable to one commercial real estate loan which matured prior to year end and was in the process of being refinanced by the company 
management believes that substantially all loans in the non performing category are well secured with a minimal risk of a material loss 
management does not consider the increase in non performing loans indicative of any adverse change in the overall asset quality of the company s total loan portfolio  however  the increase in non performing loans was taken into consideration in establishing the company s allowance for loan losses 
table non performing assets as of december  dollars in thousands loans on non accrual status loans past due days or more total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets percentage of non performing loans to total loans percentage of non performing assets to total loans loans on non accrual status includes impaired loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on impaired loans 
republic defines impaired loans to be those commercial loans greater than  that management has classified as doubtful collection of total amount due is highly questionable or improbable or loss all or a portion of the loan has been written off or a specific allowance for loss has been provided 
republic s policy is to charge off all or that portion of its investment in an impaired loan upon a determination that it is probable the full amount will not be collected

the mortgage backed securities mbss consist of year fixed  year balloons  year balloons  and adjustable rate mortgages arms as well as other adjustable rate mortgage securities  underwritten and guaranteed by gnma  fhlmc and fnma 
cmos held in the investment portfolio are substantially all floating rate securities that adjust monthly 
in addition to economic and market conditions  the overall management strategy of the investment portfolio is determined by  among other factors  loan demand  deposit mix  liquidity and collateral needs  the company s interest rate risk position and the overall structure of the balance sheet 
as of december   investment securities with a fair value of million and amortized cost of million were utilized to secure deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances 
securities available for sale decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in the available for sale portfolio was primarily in cmos  which decreased million 
the decrease in cmos was due to prepayments on the underlying collateral resulting from a declining interest rate environment 
the decline in cmos was partially offset by a million increase in agency mortgage backed securities 
the company also sold approximately million in mortgage backed investment securities during the third quarter of in anticipation of rapid prepayments due to declining long term market interest rates 
these securities had a bond equivalent yield of at the time of sale and the company recognized a gain on sale of million 
management anticipates cmos and mortgage backed securities held in the portfolio as of december  may experience rapid prepayments during the first quarter of given the low interest rate environment at the time 
if these prepayments do occur  the overall yield on the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted 
securities in the to be held to maturity portfolio increased from million at december  to million at december  the company reallocated funds during from a maturing million short term treasury bill into floating rate cmos which reprice monthly 
because management viewed these cmos as a good long term investment due to their floating rate structure and attractive interest rate spread compared to us government securities  they were classified as to be held to maturity

this increase is related to management s continued focus on gathering lower cost funds through the company s free checking promotions and cash management services 
because these accounts are typically transaction based  they are likely to have fluctuating balances from period to period 
non interest bearing deposits also include various escrow accounts  which are subject to balance fluctuations from period to period as well 
the bank s interest bearing demand accounts  primarily now and money markets  increased million during as the company heavily promoted the high interest checking now product and the premier first money market product through direct advertising and premium rate offerings 
a significant portion of the increase in these products were from funds transferred from other republic bank accounts such as money market certificates of deposit and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
new products with premium rate offerings  while attracting client funds from outside the company  also negatively impact republic s deposit products paying lower rates of interest 
the company also had an increase in jumbo certificates of deposit during as this product was heavily promoted in the banking centers and through internet banking at various times throughout the first half of the year

approximately million of this decline was due to a switch in product type by several clients into the company s higher yielding premier first money market product 
the remaining decline was primarily due to decreases in a small number of the company s larger cash management accounts 
because these accounts are transaction based  they are inherently subject to large periodic balance changes 
fhlb borrowings fhlb borrowings increased by million during the year to million at december  the increase in borrowings was primarily the result of the million in new advances the company received during the fourth quarter of to fund the newly originated year  fixed rate loans that were held within the portfolio 
the weighted average cost of these advances was with a weighted average maturity of years 
the increase in fhlb borrowings as a result of this transaction was partially offset by the maturity of a million advance during august with a coupon of 
the company also elected to prepay a million advance with a coupon of during september of recognizing a one time penalty of million 
approximately million of the company s advances are fixed with original maturities ranging from two through five years 
of these fixed rate advances  million is scheduled to mature in january with a coupon of 
management will likely refinance these advances on an overnight basis in the near term 
subject to market conditions  management may elect to extend the maturities on these advances for a longer term at some time during the remaining million in the company s borrowings consists of convertible advances with original fixed rate periods ranging from one to five years and original maturities ranging from three to ten years 
at the end of their respective fixed rate periods  the federal home loan bank has the right to convert the borrowings to floating rate advances tied to libor 
if the fhlb elects to convert the debt to a floating rate instrument  republic also has the right to pay off the advances without penalty 
the company has million in these advances that are currently eligible to be converted on their quarterly repricing date 
based on market conditions at this time  management does not believe these advances are likely to be converted in the near term 
see note regarding fhlb borrowings 
liquidity republic maintains sufficient liquidity to fund loan demand and routine deposit withdrawal activity 
liquidity is managed by retaining sufficient liquid assets in the form of investment securities and core deposits to meet demand 
funding and cash flows can also be realized by the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal paydowns on loans and mortgage backed securities and proceeds realized from the loans held for sale category 
republic s banking centers and its internet site  republicbank 
com  also provide access to retail deposit markets 
these retail deposits  if offered at attractive rates  have historically been a source of funding when needed 
traditionally  the bank has also utilized borrowings from the fhlb to supplement its funding requirements 
at december   the bank had million of borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
while republic utilizes numerous funding sources in order to meet liquidity requirements  the company also has million in approved unsecured line of credit facilities available at december  through various third party sources 
capital total stockholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity was primarily attributable to net income earned during there was also a positive impact on accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the increased value of the available for sale securities portfolio 
in addition  stockholders equity increased as a result of stock options exercised by republic s employees and directors and a million conversion of the company s guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in republic s subordinated debentures into class a common stock 
these debentures were already previously included as a component of capital for regulatory purposes 
for further discussion of the company s guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in republic s subordinated debentures see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in and  republic bancorp s board of directors approved a class a share repurchase program of  shares 
through december   republic purchased approximately  shares with a weighted average cost of  and a total cost of million 
the company was authorized to buy back an additional  shares of class a common stock under this program as of december  regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements  in part  dependent on the individual risk profiles of financial institutions 
republic continues to exceed the regulatory requirements for tier i  tier i leverage and total risk based capital 
the bank intends to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the well capitalized requirements as defined by the fdic 
republic s average capital to average assets ratio was at december  compared to at december  for further analysis  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations table off balance sheet items in thousands maturity by period contractual obligations total less than one year greater than one year to years greater than years to years greater than years stand by letters of credit lease commitments fhlb letters of credit commitments to extend credit mortgage banking commitments rate lock commitments mandatory forward sales contracts stand by letters of credit represent commitments by the company to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  the company also has liquidity risk associated with stand by letters of credit because funding for these obligations could be required immediately 
lease commitments represents the total minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases 
the company obtained letters of credit from the fhlb to be used as collateral on public funds deposits and as credit enhancements for client bond offerings 
approximately million of these letters of credit at december  were used as credit enhancements for client bond offerings 
the remaining million was used to collateralize a public funds deposit  which the company classifies as a short term borrowing 
these letters of credit reduce republic s available borrowing line at the federal home loan bank by million 
commitments to extend credit are loan commitments  which assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate on a loan republic intends to hold in its portfolio 
the risk to republic under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  republic may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved  but unfunded  loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
this is also a liquidity risk since the customer may demand immediate cash that would require funding  and interest rate risk as market interest rates may rise above the rate committed 
republic s mortgage banking activities generally includes two types of commitments by the company 
the first is a rate lock commitment with the client 
in a rate lock commitment  a client while in process of obtaining approval for a fixed rate secondary market loan can  at his own determination  fix or lock in his rate on the loan 
the commitments are generally for periods of to days and are at market rates 
to mitigate risk from market interest rate fluctuations and to deliver these loans into the secondary market  republic generally enters into mandatory forward sales contracts on rate lock commitments 
the company also has mandatory sales contracts covering loans held for sale  which no longer represent a rate lock commitment 
asset liability management and market risk asset liability management control is designed to ensure safety and soundness  maintain liquidity and regulatory capital standards  and achieve acceptable net interest income 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
management  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be republic s most significant market risk 
republic utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of republic s deposit and loan rates and their related balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
republic s interest sensitivity profile reflected little change from december  to december  given a sustained basis point downward shock to the yield curve used in the simulation model  republic s base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in the yield curve republic s base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  historically  republic s net interest margin declined in a rising interest rate environment 
while this fact remains  the company improved its risk position in from rising interest rates by extending advances from the federal home loan bank 
the company has generally maintained this improved risk position during in a declining interest rate environment  the company s net interest income historically increased 
given the low level of market interest rates as of december   however  the company may not experience a corresponding improvement in net interest income from a further decline in market interest rates as the interest paid on selected deposit products may not be subject to further material reductions 
the interest sensitivity profile of republic at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  and other factors

all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
republic operates banking centers  primarily in the retail banking industry and conducts its operations predominately in metropolitan louisville  central kentucky  southern indiana and through an internet banking software application 
republic s consolidated results of operations are dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income on interest earning assets and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
principal interest earning assets are securities and real estate mortgage  commercial  and consumer loans 
interest bearing liabilities consist of interest bearing deposit accounts and short term and long term borrowings 
other sources of income include fees charged to customers for a variety of banking services such as transaction deposit accounts and trust services 
republic also generates revenue from its mortgage banking activities  which include the origination and sale of loans in the secondary market and servicing loans for others  and through electronic tax refund services 
republic s operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  marketing and development  communications and transportation costs and other general and administrative expenses 
republic s results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory agencies 
use of estimates financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates that are particularly subject to change include the allowance for loan losses and the fair value of financial instruments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents includes cash  deposits with other financial institutions under days and federal funds sold 
net cash flows are reported for loan  deposit and other borrowing transactions 
securities securities to be held to maturity are those which republic has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at cost  adjusted for premiums and discounts that are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity 
securities available for sale  carried at fair value  consist of securities not classified as trading securities nor as held to maturity securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
gains and losses on the sale of available for sale securities are determined using the specific identification method 
premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity 
in conjunction with republic s adoption of new guidance regarding accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  on january  republic transferred substantially all of its securities classified as held to maturity at that date to available for sale 
declines in the fair value of individual securities below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs of the individual securities to their fair value 
the related write downs are included in earnings as realized losses 
federal home loan bank stock is carried at cost 
mortgage banking activities mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value 
to deliver closed loans to the secondary market and to control its interest rate risk prior to sale  republic enters non exchange traded mandatory forward sales derivative contracts 
the aggregate market value of mortgage loans held for sale considers the price of the sales contracts 
on july   republic became subject to new accounting guidance for certain commitments to originate loans 
the new guidance requires loan commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans held for sale to be accounted for as derivative instruments 
republic s commitments are for fixed rated mortgage loans  generally lasting to days and are at market rates when initiated 
considered derivatives  republic had commitments to originate million in loans as of december   which it intends to sell after the loans are closed 
because sales contract derivatives are entered into for amounts and terms offsetting the interest rate risk of loan commitment derivatives and both are carried at their fair value with changes included in earnings and substantially offset  the impact of adopting this guidance was not material 
substantially all of the gain on sale generated from mortgage banking activities continues to be recorded when closed loans are delivered into the sales contracts 
servicing rights are recognized as assets for purchased rights and for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans by interest rates and then  secondarily  by geographic and prepayment characteristics 
any impairment of a grouping is reported as a valuation allowance 
republic s loans sold in the secondary market have been primarily sold with servicing released 
accordingly  servicing rights have not had a material impact on republic s financial position or results of operations 
loan servicing income is recorded as principal payments are collected and includes servicing fees from investors and certain charges collected from borrowers  such as late payment fees 
costs of loan servicing are charged to expense as incurred 
loans loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off are reported at their outstanding principal adjusted for any charge offs  the allowance for loan losses  and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
interest on loans is computed on the principal balance outstanding 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs relating to successful loan origination efforts are deferred and recognized over the lives of the related loans as an adjustment to yield 
generally  the accrual of interest on loans  including impaired loans  is discontinued when it is determined that the collection of interest or principal is doubtful  or when a default of interest or principal has existed for days or more  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest received on non accrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income  according to management s judgment as to the collectibility of principal 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
such loans remain on non accrual status until the borrower demonstrates the ability to remain current or the loan is deemed uncollectible and is charged off 
consumer loans generally are not placed on non accrual status but are reviewed periodically and charged off when deemed uncollectible 
republic recognizes interest income on an impaired loan when earned  unless the loan is on non accrual status  in which case interest income is recognized when received 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the necessary allowance balance using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  economic conditions  regulatory guidance and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that may be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management deems a loan uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated collectively for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for commercial and commercial real estate loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on the straight line method 
estimated lives are to years for buildings and improvements  to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and to years for leasehold improvements 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
if impaired  the assets are recorded at discounted amounts 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings substantially all repurchase agreement liabilities represent amounts advanced by customers 
securities are pledged to cover most of these liabilities not covered by federal deposit insurance 
certain of these liabilities  which are not covered by federal deposit insurance  are secured by private insurance purchased by republic rather than by a pledge of securities 
stock option plans employee compensation expense under stock option plans is reported using the intrinsic value method 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying common stock at date of grant 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if expense was measured using the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no

as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
employee stock ownership plan the cost of shares held by the esop  but not yet allocated to participants  is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity 
compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are committed to be released to participant accounts 
the difference between market price and the cost of shares committed to be released is recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
dividends on allocated esop shares reduce retained earnings  dividends on unearned esop shares reduce debt and accrued interest 
financial instruments financial instruments include off balance sheet credit instruments  such as commitments to fund loans and standby letters of credit 
the face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss  before considering customer collateral or ability to repay 
such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded 
derivatives republic only uses derivative instruments as described in mortgage banking activities 
earnings per share earnings per share are based on income in the case of class b common stock  less the dividend preference on class a common stock divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
earnings per share assuming dilution shows the effect of additional common shares issuable under stock options and guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in republic s subordinated debentures 
all per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock splits occurring during the periods presented 
comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale which are also recognized as separate components of equity 
segment information segments are parts of a company evaluated by management with separate financial information

off balance sheet risks  commitments and contingent liabilities republic is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the potential future obligations of republic pursuant to those financial instruments 
creditworthiness for all instruments is evaluated on a case by case basis in accordance with republic s credit policies 
collateral from the customer may be required based on management s credit evaluation of the customer and may include business assets of commercial customers as well as personal property and real estate of individual customers or guarantors 
republic also extends binding commitments to customers and prospective customers 
such commitments assure the borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate 
the risk to republic under such loan commitments is limited by the terms of the contracts 
for example  republic may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved  but unfunded  loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
this is also a liquidity risk since the customer may demand immediate cash that would require funding  and interest rate risk as market interest rates may rise above the rate committed 
republic s liquidity position is managed to meet its need for funds 
in addition  since a portion of these loan commitments normally expire unused  the total amount of outstanding commitments at any point in time may not require future funding 
as of december   exclusive of mortgage banking loan commitments discussed in note  republic had outstanding loan commitments totaling million which includes unfunded home equity lines of credit totaling million 
these commitments generally have variable rates 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by republic to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
commitments outstanding under standby letters of credit totaled million at december  at december   republic had million in letters of credit from the federal home loan bank issued on behalf of the bank s clients 
approximately million of these letters of credit were used as credit enhancements for client bond offerings 
the remaining million was used to collateralize a public funds deposit  which the company classifies in short term borrowings 
these letters of credit reduce republic s available borrowing line at the federal home loan bank by million 
republic uses a blanket pledge of eligible real estate loans to secure the letters of credit

fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by republic using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  judgment of management is necessarily required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts republic could realize in a market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts

if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
for federal home loan bank stock  the carrying amount is an estimate of fair value 
loans the fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities 
mortgage loans held for sale estimated fair value is defined as the quoted secondary market price for such loans without regard to republic s other commitments to make and sell loans 
deposits the fair value of demand deposits  savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using the interest rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings the carrying amount is management s estimate of fair value 
guaranteed preferred beneficial interests the fair value is estimated based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the rates at which similar financings with the same remaining maturities could be obtained 
other borrowed funds the fair value is estimated based on the estimated present value of future cash outflows using the rates at which similar loans with the same remaining maturities could be obtained 
commitments to extend credit the fair value of commitments to extend credit is based upon the difference between the interest rate at which republic is committed to make the loans and the rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities  adjusted for the estimated volume of loan commitments expected to close 
the fair value of such commitments is not material 
commitments to sell loans the fair value of commitments to sell loans is based upon the difference between the interest rates at which republic is committed to sell the loans and the quoted secondary market price for similar loans 
the fair value of such commitments is not material 
the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  and although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date and  therefore  estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented
