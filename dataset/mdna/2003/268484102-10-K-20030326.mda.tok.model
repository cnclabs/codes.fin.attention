net revenues  which represent revenues less freight transportation costs  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in air freight forwarding revenues 
air freight forwarding revenues decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in primarily as a result of volume decreases in north america offset by volume increases in south america and asia pacific 
the volume decreases in north america were primarily due to the weakened us economy 
north america was also adversely affected by the shift from air expedited shipments next flight out  next day or second day time definite shipments to economy ground deferred shipments third through fifth day 
air freight forwarding revenues increased million  or to million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we benefited from the us west coast port strike and chartered dedicated planes to move product from asia to north america 
air freight forwarding net revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the air freight forwarding margin net revenues as a percentage of revenues increased to in as compared to for the increase in margin was primarily related to the elimination of the us dedicated charter commitments in  better yield management and better buying opportunities on our international freight forwarding services 
ocean freight forwarding revenues 
ocean freight forwarding revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of volume increases in europe and asia pacific offset by decreases in north and south america 
ocean freight forwarding net revenues decreased  or  to million in compared to million in and the ocean freight forwarding margin decreased to in compared to in primarily due to a decrease in the number of shipments moving on a direct basis rather than through consolidation service 
customs brokerage and other revenues 
customs brokerage and other revenues  which include warehousing  distribution and other logistics services  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher warehousing  distribution and other logistics revenues resulting from new warehousing customers and expansion of existing warehousing business in europe and asia pacific 
customs brokerage revenues remained constant in compared to with increases in inbound traffic in asia pacific offset by decreases across all other geographic divisions 
operating expenses 
personnel costs include all compensation expenses  including those relating to sales commissions and salaries and to headquarters employees and executive officers 
personnel costs decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  personnel costs were in compared to in the reduction in personnel costs was a result of headcount reductions throughout  which eliminated approximately full time employees  a reduction of approximately employees during  controls in the use of contract labor and a temporary salary reduction for five pay periods implemented in the us during the first quarter of the cost savings from the reduction in headcount in were offset by approximately million of severance costs recorded in the third quarter of other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  were in compared to in this decrease is primarily due to management initiatives on costs savings  the realization of merger related cost synergies  and the elimination of goodwill amortization expense due to the implementation of sfas these cost savings were partially offset by an increase in facility costs  insurance premiums  and depreciation expense 
although we completed the consolidation of many of our facilities  our facility costs increased by approximately million because we are leasing more space than in the previous year for our expanded warehousing and logistics services 
the increase in depreciation expense was largely related to increases in computer software and office equipment depreciation 
during the third quarter of  we took an impairment charge of  related to a management decision not to use certain architectural design plans for a proposed building in canada 
eeoc legal settlement

severance costs were recorded for certain employees at the former circle headquarters and former circle management at certain international locations who were terminated or notified of their termination under our integration plan prior to december  as of december   we no longer employed approximately of the employees included in the integration plan we established in connection with the circle acquisition 
the termination of substantially all of the remaining employees occurred in the first quarter of additional severance costs of approximately million were recorded during the year ended december  also  during january  we announced an additional reduction in our workforce of approximately additional employees 
the charge for this workforce reduction is approximately  and was recorded during the first quarter of future lease obligations 
future lease obligations consist of our remaining lease obligations under noncancelable operating leases at domestic and international locations that we are in the process of vacating and consolidating due to excess capacity resulting from having multiple facilities in certain locations 
the provisions of our integration plan include the consolidation of facilities of approximately of our operating locations 
during the second half of  we determined the estimated consolidation dates for several of the remaining facilities and recorded an additional charge of million 
all lease costs for facilities being consolidated are charged to operations until the date that we vacate each facility 
amounts recorded for future lease obligations under our integration plan are net of approximately million in anticipated future recoveries from actual or expected sublease agreements as of december  sublease income has been anticipated under the integration plan only in locations where sublease agreements have been executed as of december  or are deemed probable of execution during the first half of there is a risk that subleasing transactions will not occur within the same timing or pricing assumptions made by us or at all  which could result in future revisions to these estimates 
during and  we recorded an additional charge of million and million  respectively  based on revised estimates for future recoveries from actual or expected sublease agreements that were or are expected to be less favorable than anticipated due to the weakened us economy 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we decided to utilize two of the facilities in our logistics operations as we determined the expected return on operations was greater than the sublease income we expected to obtain in these two markets 
therefore  we reversed the million reserve established for these facilities 
termination of joint venture agency agreements 
costs to terminate joint venture agency agreements represent contractually obligated costs incurred to terminate selected joint venture and agency agreements with certain of our former business partners along with assets that were not expected to be fully recoverable as a result of our decision to terminate these agreements

these costs were expensed as incurred 
noncash charge 
during  we recorded a charge for assets not expected to be recoverable which primarily consisted of fixed assets at the various locations that were being consolidated under our integration plan and will no longer be used in our ongoing operations 
in  we revised these estimates by  for assets that were determined to be recoverable since they will continue to be used in operations 
operating income loss 
operating income was million in as compared to an operating loss of million for the increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenues of million  decreases in personnel costs of million  other selling  general and administrative expenses of million and transaction  restructuring and integration costs of million as well as million received from the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
nonoperating income expense  net 
nonoperating expense  net was million in as compared to million in the million increase was primarily due to an impairment charge of approximately million for our investment in miami air and a million reserve established for miami air s outstanding letters of credit guaranteed by us offset by lower interest expense as a result of the lower interest rate on our convertible notes compared to the interest rate on debt outstanding in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we incurred net foreign exchange gains of  in compared to a net foreign exchange loss of  in nonoperating expense in was reduced by a million gain recognized by recording the market value of a nonmarketable investment in equity securities that became marketable and was classified as available for sale 
effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for was compared to for our overall effective tax rate fluctuates primarily due to changes in the level of pre tax income in foreign countries that have different rates and certain income and or expenses that are permanently non taxable or non deductible in certain jurisdictions  respectively 
compared to revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in primarily due to decreases in air freight forwarding revenues 
net revenues  which represents revenues less freight transportation costs  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in air freight forwarding revenues 
air freight forwarding revenues decreased million  or  to  million in compared to  million in primarily as a result of volume decreases in north america and asia 
the volume decreases in north america were primarily attributable to the weakened us economy 
north america was also adversely affected by the shift from air expedited shipments next flight out  next day or second day time definite shipments to economy ground deferred shipments third through fifth day 
air freight forwarding net revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the air freight forwarding margin net revenues as a percentage of revenues declined to in as compared to for due to a softening of the us economy  primarily in the technology  telecommunications and automotive industries  and the resulting shift from air expedited shipments to economy ground deferred shipments which generate lower revenues and lower margins 
the air freight forwarding margin was also adversely impacted in by the fixed costs of transportation related to charter aircraft leases mainly utilized in north america which were carrying less freight than targeted operating levels as a result of the factors discussed in the previous sentence 
in june  we paid million to terminate one of our air charter lease agreements 
in mid august  we negotiated agreements to reduce our exposure to future losses on leased aircraft 
a lease for two of the aircraft was terminated with no financial penalty  and we agreed to sublease five aircraft on another lease to a third party at rates below our contractual commitment  which resulted in a charge in of approximately million 
although asia experienced lower revenues from lower activity  the air freight forwarding net revenue margin for asia improved due to better buying opportunities from carriers 
ocean freight forwarding revenues 
ocean freight forwarding revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily as a result of volume decreases in north america and asia 
ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in due to increased direct activity volumes in europe  coupled with lower transportation costs in asia  north america and europe for consolidation services 
activity from expanded operations in france resulting from a joint venture with the mory group contributed to the improved results in europe 
the ocean freight forwarding margin increased to in compared to in primarily due to an increase in the number of shipments moving on a direct basis rather than through consolidation services and  to a lesser extent  better buying opportunities on consolidation activity 
customs brokerage and other revenues 
customs brokerage and other revenues  which includes warehousing  distribution and other logistics services  decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  while net customs brokerage and other revenues increased million  or  to million in compared to million in customs brokerage revenues were lower in due to a decrease in inbound traffic in all geographic divisions except europe and the middle east 
activity from substantially expanded operations in france and ireland and the opening of a wholly owned subsidiary in south africa significantly contributed to the higher revenues in the europe and the middle east segment 
warehousing and distribution revenues increased as a result of new and expanded warehousing customers mainly in north america  partially offset by a decline in activity in asia 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses personnel and other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs were not reduced commensurate with the decline in revenues during the early part of in anticipation of improved activity levels 
additionally  actions taken during to add additional warehouse and dock space in anticipation of continued market share gains and growth in activity resulted in higher occupancy related expenses that came on line during we also added significant information technology it related consultant expenses during to develop an integration plan and to begin the integration of the egl and circle it systems 
the combination of a delay in implementing reductions in personnel related expenses consistent with the lower activity levels  the addition of warehouse and dock space that started in and higher it related expenses contributed to our losses in personnel costs include all compensation expenses  including those relating to sales commissions and salaries and to headquarters employees and executive officers 
personnel costs increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  personnel costs were  in compared to in our history of rapid revenue growth has historically required us to increase our headcount at a fast pace to prepare for increased levels of activity to maintain our high level of customer service 
as a result  employee headcount increased throughout and into early in anticipation of efforts to integrate and grow in connection with the egl circle merger 
when freight shipments began to slow toward the end of the first quarter of  we attempted to alleviate the impact of the slowdown by implementing a furlough program in march with no strong signs of a near term economic rebound  we reduced our headcount during the remainder of to bring it in line with then current activity levels 
during  approximately regular full time and contract employees were released  including the former circle headquarters employees 
these reductions represented approximately of our us workforce 
in the europe and middle east region  headcount was increased by due to new and expanded operations in france  ireland and south africa 
the associated compensation expenses were the main cause of the increase in our total personnel costs 
we implemented a temporary salary reduction for five pay periods during the first quarter of for salaried personnel in the us in an effort to decrease personnel costs during our seasonally slow first quarter 
other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of net revenues  other selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding eeoc legal costs and transaction  restructuring and integration costs  were in compared to in this increase is due to an overall increase in the level of our activities during and the first nine months of without the corresponding net revenue growth in due to the reduced shipping volumes and the shift from air expedited shipments to economy ground deferred shipments which generate lower revenues at lower margins  but with a similar cost structure 
eeoc legal settlement

in  we revised these estimates by  for assets that were determined to be recoverable since they will continue to be used in operations

liquidity and capital resources general our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we substantially reduced operating costs between the second and third quarter of and worked to diversify our customer base 
additionally  we made significant efforts to collect outstanding customer accounts receivable amounts and were able to use the cash from these collections to avoid additional net borrowings on our line of credit during if we achieve significant near term revenue growth  we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements through december  however  we cannot provide assurance that there will be no change that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
for example  the terrorist attacks on the united states in  as well as future events occurring in response to  or in connection with them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against the united states or its allies or military or trade or travel disruptions impacting our ability to sell and market our services in the united states and internationally may impact our results of operations 
additionally  funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs primarily ocean and customs duties for which the customer is the primary obligor 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenue and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenue and expense on our statement of operations  rather  they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables 
growth in the level of this activity or lengthening of the period of time between incurring these costs and being reimbursed by our customers for these costs may negatively affect our liquidity 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities

in connection with the miami air investment  miami air and egl entered into an aircraft charter agreement whereby miami air agreed to convert certain of its passenger aircraft to cargo aircraft and to provide aircraft charter services to egl for a three year term  and we caused a million standby letter of credit to be issued in favor of certain creditors for miami air to assist miami air in financing the conversion of its aircraft 
miami air agreed to pay egl an annual fee equal to of the face amount of the letter of credit and to reimburse egl for any payments made by egl in respect of the letter of credit 
as of december   miami air had no funded debt under the line of credit that is supported by the standby letter of credit 
additionally  as of december   miami air had outstanding million in letters of credit and surety bonds that were supported by the standby letter of credit 
this letter of credit was reduced to million in january there were previously four aircraft subject to the aircraft charter agreement 
during  we paid miami air approximately million under the aircraft charter agreement for use of four cargo airplanes under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance  or acmi  arrangement 
the payments were based on market rates in effect at the time the lease was entered into 
in late february  egl and miami air mutually agreed to ground one of these aircraft because of the need for maintenance on that plane 
during the first four months of  there were three aircraft subject to the aircraft charter agreement and we paid approximately million related to this agreement 
in may  egl and miami air mutually agreed to cancel the aircraft charter agreement for the three planes as of may  and we paid  for services rendered in may and aircraft repositioning costs 
the weak economy and events of september  significantly reduced the demand for cargo plane services  particularly cargo planes 
as a result  the market value of these planes declined dramatically 
miami air made egl aware that the amounts due miami air s bank which are secured by seven planes were significantly higher than the market value of those planes 
in addition  miami air had outstanding operating leases for and airplanes at above current market rates  including two planes that were expected to be delivered in throughout the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  miami air was in discussions with its bank to obtain debt concessions on the seven planes  to buy out the lease on a cargo plane and to reduce the rates on the passenger planes 
miami air had informed us that its creditors had indicated a willingness to make concessions 
in may  we were informed that miami air s creditors were no longer willing to make concession and that negotiations with its creditors had reached an impasse and no agreement appeared feasible 
as such  in the first quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment of the entire carrying value of our million investment in miami air  which included a  increase in value attributable to egl s share of miami air s first quarter results of operations 
in addition  we recorded an accrual of million for our estimated exposure on the outstanding funded debt and letters of credit supported by the million subsequently reduced to million in january standby letter of credit 
during the third quarter of  miami air informed us that certain of its creditors had  in fact  made certain concessions 
we have not adjusted our accrual  and there can be no assurance that the ultimate loss  if any  will not exceed such estimate requiring an additional charge

miami land purchase currently  our operations in miami  florida are located in three different facilities 
in order to increase operational efficiencies  we acquired land to be used as the site for a new facility to consolidate our miami operations 
the land was acquired on august  from a related party entity controlled by james r 
crane for million in cash  including our acquisition costs of  this parcel of land had been previously identified by egl as the most advantageous property on which to consolidate its miami operations 
egl entered into negotiations on the land and reached agreement with the seller on terms 
however  given the downturn in the economy and our weakening financial condition at that point in time  egl elected to delay purchasing this property until our financial condition improved 
on july   mr 
crane purchased the land in anticipation of reselling the land to egl 
the purchase price represented the lower of current market value  based on an independent appraisal  or mr 
crane s purchase price plus carrying costs for the land 
egl s audit committee  consisting of five independent directors  engaged in an analysis and discussion regarding whether it was in the best interest of egl to enter into a purchase agreement to purchase this particular tract of land from mr 
crane 
the audit committee analysis included  but was not limited to  obtaining an independent appraisal of the land  reviewing a comparative properties analysis performed by an outside independent real estate company and performing a cost benefit analysis for several different alternatives 
based upon the data obtained from the analysis  the audit committee determined the best alternative for egl  in its opinion  was for egl to purchase the property from mr 
crane 
the audit committee then made a recommendation to egl s board of directors  which includes six independent directors  to purchase this land at mr 
crane s purchase price plus carrying costs  which was lower than the current market value 
in august  the purchase was approved unanimously by egl s board of directors  with mr 
crane abstaining from the vote

gibert to sell his entire interest in the subsidiaries at a price based on the valuation methodology 
consulting agreement in connection with peter gibert stepping down as chief executive officer of circle and relocating to spain in  mr 
gibert entered into a consulting agreement with circle pursuant to which he agreed to provide sales  marketing  strategic planning  acquisition  training and other assistance as reasonably requested wherever circle has operations  other than in the united states  spain and portugal 
the consulting agreement provided for annual compensation in the first year of  and annual compensation in the second and third years of  per year 
the consulting agreement  which has a three year term that commenced january   also prohibited mr 
gibert  directly or indirectly  from competing against circle during the term of the consulting agreement  plus six months thereafter

see other factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources 
seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the first quarter  ending march  has traditionally been the weakest  and the third quarter  ending september  has traditionally been the strongest 
this pattern is the result of  or is influenced by  numerous factors  including climate  national holidays  consumer demand  economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces 
in addition  this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of our terminal network 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are o the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  o management s understanding of the company s business both historical results and expected future results  o the extent to which operational controls exist that provide high degrees of assurance that all desired information to assist in the estimation is available and reliable or whether there is greater uncertainty in the information that is available upon which to base the estimate  o expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically  globally and within various sectors that serve as principal customers and suppliers of goods and services  o expected rates of change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  and o whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
the estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates which could be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity  quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate 
management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate  however  actual amounts could and will differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition revenue and freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin  one of the permissible methods authorized by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
this method generally results in recognition of revenue and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenue until a proof of delivery is received 
customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services 
revenue recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator includes the direct carrier s charges to egl for carrying the shipment 
revenue recognized in other capacities includes only the commission and fees received 
in january  eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred was effective for egl 
this issue clarified certain provisions of eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and among other things established when reimbursements are required to be shown gross as opposed to net 
eitf no 
also directed that the new rules should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after december  the clarifying rules now require the company to report revenues from certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross rather than net basis 
the company has complied with the guidance in eitf no 
and reclassified to cost of transportation  for all periods presented  the costs of certain reimbursed incidental activities previously reported net in revenues 
the following table illustrates the financial statement impact of the reclassification by comparing revenues previously reported on a net basis with revenues reported on a gross basis in this annual report on form k 
there is no impact on net revenues  operating income loss or net income loss as a result of this reclassification 
year ended december  net gross net gross net gross in thousands revenues air freight forwarding       ocean freight forwarding       customs brokerage and other       total revenues       cost of transportation air freight forwarding       ocean freight forwarding       customs brokerage and other     total costs       net revenues       computer software certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
costs related to the preliminary project stage  data conversion and the post implementation operation stage of a software development project are expensed as incurred 
on retirement or sale of assets  the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss  if any  is credited or charged to income 
we have incurred substantial costs during the periods presented related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed over that time period 
inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development  such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems 
management believes that all projects capitalized at december  will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities included in a business combination  and therefore  indirectly affected by management s estimates and judgments 
prior to january   we amortized goodwill and other intangible assets on a straight line basis over the period of expected benefit  not exceeding years 
in  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets but instead test for impairment at least annually or wherever circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over the period of expected benefit 
impairment of assets substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstance has occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset 
estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets 
should impairment appear to be necessary  subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset  for which there may be no ready market  which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process 
if we determine an asset has been impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the remaining amortization period  and if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset or the present value of the expected future cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of intercompany obligations two times per month 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
our lease payments on certain financed facilities are tied to market interest rates 
at december   a rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income in we have not purchased any material futures contracts nor have we purchased or held any material derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during in december  we entered into a contract for the purpose of hedging the costs of a portion of our anticipated jet fuel purchases for chartered aircraft during the following twelve months 
this contract matures in november see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement  which was designated as a cash flow hedge  to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on million of our libor based revolving credit facility or any substitutive debt agreements we enter into 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december  the proceeds from these notes substantially retired the libor based debt outstanding under the then existing revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate on the convertible notes is fixed  therefore  the variability of the future interest payments has been eliminated 
the swap agreement no longer qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting and has been undesignated as of december  the net loss on the swap agreement included in other comprehensive income loss as of december  was million and is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the swap agreement and changes in fair value of the swap agreement are recorded in interest expense 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded million net interest expense which includes  relating to amortization of the deferred loss and changes in the fair value of the swap agreement 
exchange rate sensitivity the following tables provide comparable information about our non functional currency components of balance sheet items by currency  and presents such information in us dollar equivalents at december  and these tables summarize information on transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including non functional currency denominated receivables and payables
