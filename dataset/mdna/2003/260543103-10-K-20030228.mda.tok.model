asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
at the end of and through the third quarter of  union carbide had concluded it was not possible to estimate its cost of disposing of asbestos related claims that might be filed against union carbide and amchem products  inc amchem in the future due to a number of reasons  including its lack of sufficient comparable loss history from which to assess either the number or value of future asbestos related claims 
during the third and fourth quarters of  union carbide worked with analysis  research planning corporation arpc  a consulting firm with broad experience in estimating resolution costs associated with mass tort litigation including asbestos to explore whether it would be possible to estimate the cost of disposing of pending and future asbestos related claims that have been  and could reasonably be expected to be  filed against union carbide and amchem 
in projecting union carbide s resolution costs for future asbestos related claims  arpc applied two methodologies that have been widely used for forecasting purposes 
as of december   arpc estimated the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  for the year period from the present through to be between approximately billion and billion  depending on which of the two accepted methodologies was used 
although arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time  based on arpc s advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate and in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long term projections  union carbide determined that the year period through is the reasonable time period for projecting the cost of disposing of its future asbestos related claims 
union carbide concluded that it is probable that the undiscounted cost of disposing of asbestos related pending and future claims ranges from billion to billion  which is the range for the year period ending in as estimated by arpc using both methodologies 
accordingly  union carbide increased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
for pending claims  union carbide had an asbestos related liability of million at december  union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december  union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  in addition  union carbide had receivables for insurance recoveries for defense and resolution costs of million at december  and million at december  the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon currently known facts 
however  projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
union carbide expenses defense and processing costs as incurred 
accordingly  defense and processing costs incurred by union carbide in the future for asbestos related litigation  net of insurance  will impact union carbide s results of operations in future periods

environmental matters the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
the company had accrued obligations of million at december   for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount

merger related expenses and restructuring on february   union carbide corporation merged with a subsidiary of the company and became a wholly owned subsidiary of dow 
on march   dow s management made certain decisions relative to employment levels  duplicate assets and facilities and excess capacity resulting from the union carbide merger 
these decisions were based on management s assessment of the actions necessary to achieve synergies as a result of the merger 
the economic effects of these decisions  combined with merger related transaction costs and certain asset impairments  resulted in a pretax special charge of  million in the first quarter of subsequent periodic reviews of the company s integration plans resulted in minor revisions to the reserve 
the planned merger related program for workforce reductions was substantially completed in the third quarter of  although during the fourth quarter of  an additional charge was recorded for merger related severance to be paid in the first quarter of upon completion of the program  the outstanding merger related reserve for employee related costs associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans became part of the company s regular pension and other postretirement obligations 
the reserve related to the abandonment of leased facilities is included in other noncurrent obligations 
in late  immediately following the appointment of a new president and ceo  management began a series of studies to determine potential actions relative to under performing assets and employment levels 
prior to the end of the year  certain studies were completed and management made decisions relative to certain assets 
the economic effects of these decisions resulted in a pretax charge in the fourth quarter of of million for severance and asset write downs and impairments 
the program for severance was based on plans communicated to employees  and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of the charge related to asset write downs was based on the net book value of the manufacturing plants to be shut down 
the charge related to asset impairments was determined using either discounted cash flows or a fair market value assessment 
additional decisions on businesses and facilities are expected in the company will account for future workforce reductions as they occur  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
for further discussion and information regarding merger related expenses and restructuring  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firm  which includes the actuary s review of the asset class return expectations of several respected consultants and economists  based on broad equity and bond indices 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance and comparisons to expected returns of peer companies with similar fund assets is also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption was reduced to percent for determining net periodic pension expense 
lowering the expected long term rate of return of the us qualified plan assets by percent from percent to percent would have reduced the pension income of the us qualified plans for by approximately million 
the company s historical actual return averaged percent for the ten year period ending december  future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
for the year ending december   billion of losses remain to be recognized by the us qualified plans in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these losses will result in decreases in future pension income as they are recognized 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the us qualified plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the resulting discount rate decreased from percent at december   to percent at december  for  the company left its assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the us qualified plans unchanged at percent 
based on the revised pension assumptions and the actual investment performance of the plan assets in  the company expects to record million of incremental expense for all pension and other postretirement benefits in the value of the us qualified plan assets decreased from billion at december   to billion at december  the investment performance and declining discount rates reduced the funded status of the us qualified plans  net of benefit obligations  by billion from december  to december  the company does not expect significant cash contributions to be required for the us qualified plans in income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates for the effects of net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized 
in determining the appropriate valuation allowance  certain judgments are made relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets  use of tax loss carryforwards  level of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
these judgments are routinely reviewed by management 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of billion  after valuation allowances of million

environmental matters environmental policies dow is committed to world class environmental  health and safety eh s performance  as demonstrated by a long standing commitment to responsible care and progress made toward the company s eh s goals for in  dow publicly announced its voluntary global eh s goals ambitious performance targets to measure progress toward sustainable development  including targets to reduce chemical emissions  waste and wastewater by percent 
equally aggressive are dow s eh s goals to reduce leaks  spills  fires  explosions  work related injuries and transportation incidents by percent 
dow continues to work aggressively toward attainment of these goals and its vision of zero 
more information on dow s performance regarding environmental matters can be found online in dow s public report 
to meet the company s public commitments  as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject  dow has well defined policies  requirements and management systems 
dow s eh s management system ems defines for the businesses the who  what  when and how needed to achieve the company s policies  requirements  performance objectives  leadership expectations and public commitments 
ems is also designed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection and to comply with these laws and regulations 
furthermore  ems is integrated into a company wide management system for eh s  operations  quality and human resources  including implementation of the global eh s work process to improve eh s performance and to ensure ongoing compliance worldwide 
it is dow s stated eh s policy that all global operations and products meet dow s requirements or their country s laws and regulations  whichever are more stringent 
it is also dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities 
dow believes third party verification is a cornerstone of world class eh s performance and building public trust 
over the last five years  numerous dow sites in europe  latin america  australia and north america have received third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso in  dow received the american chemistry council s responsible care employee health safety code sustained excellence award 
the annual sustained excellence award recognizes companies that have demonstrated outstanding safety records over a three year period 
this is the first time that any company from the large size category has been eligible for the award 
for the fourth year in a row  dow was also added to the dow jones sustainability group index 
dow s ems and eh s goals are designed to minimize environmental risks and impacts  both past and future 
the following paragraphs outline some of these potential risks and how they are managed to minimize environmental impact and overall costs 
climate change there is growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg due to human activities continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the climate 
dow takes global climate change very seriously and is committed to reducing its ghg intensity lbs 
of ghg per lb 
of product  developing climate friendly products and processes  and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced ghg intensity by over percent 
total direct emissions of ghg have also been significantly reduced 
this trend could reverse  however  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
given the uncertainties regarding implementation of the kyoto protocol and related climate change policies  it is speculative to engage in an assessment of either the potential liability or benefit associated with climate change issues 
as noted in the public report  dow is making progress toward its goal to improve energy efficiency by percent 
by the time dow achieves this goal  it will have avoided the production of over trillion btus  thus contributing in a positive way to climate change 
dow also contributes to the climate change solution by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
dow does not currently engage in emissions trading but is studying this concept and engaging in dialogue with governments about the development of fair and effective mechanisms to achieve ghg reductions at the lowest possible cost 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the liability related to remediation at december  was million 
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 
dow filed a lawsuit in november against several of its insurers seeking recovery of remediation costs at certain current or former dow owned sites 
settlements have been reached with all carriers  except one 
in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
dow readily cooperates in the remediation of these sites where the company s liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
management s estimate of the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million  which has been accrued  although the ultimate cost with respect to these sites could exceed that amount 
in addition  receivables of million for probable recoveries from other prps have been recorded related to superfund sites 
at december   the company s liability for the remediation of superfund sites was million  the receivable for probable recoveries from other prps was million 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages  often in very large amounts 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in both and  influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation 
union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future 
union carbide will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
typically  union carbide is only one of many named defendants  many of which  including union carbide and amchem  were members of the center for claims resolution ccr  an entity that defended and resolved asbestos cases on behalf of its members 
as members of the ccr  union carbide s and amchem s strategy was to resolve the claims against them at the relatively small percentage allocated to them pursuant to the ccr s collective defense 
the ccr ceased operating in february  except to administer certain settlements 
union carbide then began using peterson asbestos claims enterprise  but only for claims processing and insurance invoicing 
certain members of dow s legal department and certain dow management personnel have been retained to provide their experience in mass tort litigation to assist union carbide in responding to asbestos related matters 
in early  union carbide hired new outside counsel to serve as national trial counsel 
in connection with these actions  aggressive defense strategies were designed to reduce the cost of resolving all asbestos related claims  including the elimination of claims that lack demonstrated illness or causality 
at the end of and through the third quarter of  union carbide had concluded it was not possible to estimate its cost of disposing of asbestos related claims that might be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future due to a number of reasons  including its lack of sufficient comparable loss history from which to assess either the number or value of future asbestos related claims 
during the third and fourth quarters of  union carbide worked with analysis  research planning corporation arpc  a consulting firm with broad experience in estimating resolution costs associated with mass tort litigation  including asbestos  to explore whether it would be possible to estimate the cost of disposing of pending and future asbestos related claims that have been  and could reasonably be expected to be  filed against union carbide and amchem 
union carbide provided arpc with all relevant data regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem through november  arpc concluded that it was not possible to estimate the full range of the cost of resolving future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  because of various uncertainties associated with the litigation of those claims 
these uncertainties  which hindered union carbide s ability to project future claim volumes and resolution costs  included the following until a series of bankruptcies led to the ccr ceasing operations in early  union carbide and amchem generally settled claims filed against ccr members according to a sharing formula that would not necessarily reflect the cost of resolving those claims had they been separately litigated against union carbide or amchem 
the bankruptcies in the years to of other companies facing large asbestos liability were a likely contributing cause of a sharp increase in filings against many defendants  including union carbide and amchem 
it was not until the ccr ceased operating in early that union carbide took direct responsibility for the defense of claims against itself and amchem 
new defense counsel for union carbide and amchem implemented more aggressive defense strategies in mid despite its inability to estimate the full range of the cost of resolving future asbestos related claims  arpc advised union carbide that it would be possible to determine an estimate of a reasonable forecast of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims likely to face union carbide and amchem  if certain assumptions were made 
specifically  arpc advised union carbide that for purposes of determining an estimate it is reasonable to assume that in the near term asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem are unlikely to return to levels below those experienced prior to when the recent spike in filings commenced and that average claim values are unlikely to return to levels below those experienced in  the years immediately following ccr s cessation of operations 
arpc advised union carbide that  by assuming that future filings were unlikely to exceed the levels experienced prior to and extrapolating from and average claim values  arpc could make a reasonable forecast of the cost of resolving asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
arpc also advised union carbide that forecasts of resolution costs for a to year period from the date of the forecast are likely to be more accurate than forecasts for longer periods of time 
in projecting union carbide s resolution costs for future asbestos related claims  arpc applied two methodologies that have been widely used for forecasting purposes 
applying these methodologies  arpc forecast the number and allocation by disease category of those potential future claims on a year by year basis through arpc then calculated the percentage of claims in each disease category that had been closed with payments in and using those percentages  arpc calculated the number of future claims by disease category that would likely require payment by union carbide and amchem and multiplied the number of such claims by the mean values paid by union carbide and amchem  respectively  to dispose of such claims in and in estimating union carbide s cost of resolving pending claims  arpc used a process similar to that used for calculating the cost of resolving future claims 
as of december   arpc estimated the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  for the year period from the present through to be between approximately billion and billion  depending on which of the two accepted methodologies was used 
although arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time  based on arpc s advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate and in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long term projections  union carbide determined that the year period through is the reasonable time period for projecting the cost of disposing of its future asbestos related claims 
union carbide concluded that it is probable that the undiscounted cost of disposing of asbestos related pending and future claims ranges from billion to billion  which is the range for the year period ending in as estimated by arpc using both methodologies 
accordingly  union carbide increased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
for pending claims  union carbide had an asbestos related liability of million at december  union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december   substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
this resulted in a net income statement impact to union carbide of million  million on an after tax basis  in the fourth quarter of union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
in addition  union carbide had receivables for insurance recoveries for defense and resolution costs of million at december  and million at december  defense and resolution costs for union carbide s asbestos related litigation were million in  million in and million in the million in included million for defense costs which included significant costs for the development and implementation of union carbide s new and more aggressive defense strategies and million for bulk settlements with multiple claimants 
to date  substantially all of these defense and resolution costs were covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for future asbestos related defense costs will exist  but to a lesser extent 
the pretax impact to union carbide for these defense and resolution costs  net of insurance  was million in  million in and million in  and was reflected in cost of sales 
the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon currently known facts 
however  projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
union carbide expenses defense and processing costs as incurred 
accordingly  defense and processing costs incurred by union carbide in the future for asbestos related litigation  net of insurance  will impact union carbide s results of operations in future periods 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
union carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of union carbide s asbestos related claims  including future defense and processing costs  could have a material adverse impact on union carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of union carbide 
it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense and processing costs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company 
the dow chemical company and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per sfas no 
 where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges per sfas no 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to european currencies and the japanese yen 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
cracker feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation move in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity of the company 
the var methodology used by dow is based primarily on the variance covariance statistical model
