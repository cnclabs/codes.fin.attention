management believes that cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with projected cash flow from operations and the sale of certain assets will provide adequate funding to meet its expected working capital  capital expenditure and restructuring cost requirements for the next twelve months 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on the company s revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flow from operations could be positively or negatively impacted

inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which the company operates and has not had a significant impact upon the results of its operations 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the ips and ame segments recognize a significant portion of revenue and related profit as work progresses on long term contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
the company uses this method because reasonably dependable estimates can be made throughout the performance of the contracts 
since financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  recognized revenues and profits are subject to increase or decrease as the contract progresses to completion 
the company records a liability and expense for the estimated cost of product warranties and installation at the time revenue is recognized 
these estimates are based primarily on the company s historical warranty experience rates 
should the actual cost of product warranties or installation differ  the related liabilities could be adjusted upward or downward 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial conditions of the company s customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are supported by contractual agreements regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
the company often requires letters of credit of deposit payments prior to the commencement of work or obtains progress payments upon the achievement of certain milestones 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness 
the company continuously monitors collection and payments from our customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant factors such as the delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  however  future credit loss rates may differ from historical experience 
the company has historically experienced and expects to continue to experience minimal amounts of uncollected accounts receivable 
in the years ended december   and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively 
inventory obsolescence 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company writes down its inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
several factors may affect the sale and use of the company s inventories  including technological changes  exiting a product line  or new product development 
such factors could result in a change in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  possibly resulting in understatement or overstatement of the provision required for obsolete or excess inventory 
in the future  the company may determine that its inventory was overvalued  and may be required to recognize a charge in cost of sales and service in its consolidated statement of operations at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company determines that its inventory is undervalued  it may have overstated cost of sales and service in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional income 
the company makes every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  however  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of the company s inventory and reported operating results 
deferred tax assets 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in evaluating the likelihood of recovering its deferred tax assets and the adequacy of the related valuation allowance 
if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
goodwill and other intangibles 
until the adoption  on january   of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill is now evaluated for potential impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be fully recoverable  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then impairment is measured and recorded as the excess of the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the company establishes the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  which include revenue and profit margin assumptions  based on management s best estimate 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  possibly resulting in a requirement to record a charge for asset impairment 
other intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted expected cash flows to be generated by a long lived asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount  the company records an impairment to write down the long lived asset or asset group to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
pension benefits and other postretirement benefits 
the company has retirement and pension plans which cover most of its employees 
most of the company s us employees as well as the employees of certain us subsidiaries are covered by contributory defined benefit plans  under which employees may contribute up to of covered compensation annually 
annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to adequately fund the plans 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with an external actuary 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data  such as the rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated annually 
note k to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for the company s domestic and foreign plans 
the company believes the assumptions are within accepted guidelines and ranges 
however  these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively impacting future results of operations 
the discount rate  used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for domestic and foreign plans as of december  were and  respectively  compared to and as of september  the decline reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  the company uses historic market trends combined with current market conditions and asset allocation 
as of december   the company lowered the expected long term rate of return on its domestic and foreign plans to and  respectively  from and 
the company determines the expected rate of compensation increase based on historic trends and comparisons to external rates 
as of december   the company reduced the rates to and annually for domestic and foreign plans  respectively  from and 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other post retirement benefits include a discount rate of   and at december   and  respectively 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would result in an increase to the postretirement benefit obligation of approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease results in a decrease in the obligation of million 
contingencies 
the company assesses its exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provides for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a loss contingency differs from management s estimates  results of operations could be adjusted upward or downward

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from its short term and long term borrowings and to foreign exchange rate risk with respect to its foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates as of december   the company s outstanding borrowings comprised million in fixed rate debentures  a million variable rate minimum term loan  and an million variable rate industrial revenue bond 
in january the company fully paid down and terminated the term loan 
in addition  the company had variable rate facilities with no outstanding borrowings comprised of the revolving facility and the uk facility 
net of outstanding letters of credit and limitations on minimum availability  the company had borrowing capacity of million under the revolving facility and million under the uk facility 
see discussions of the company s credit facilities under the heading liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report and in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents principal cash flows and interest rates by maturity dates and the fair values of the company s borrowings as of december  fair values for fixed rate borrowings have been determined based on recent market trade values 
the fair values for variable rate borrowings approximate their carrying value 
the term loan is not included in the table as it was fully paid down and terminated in january debt total fair value fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate foreign exchange rates due to its global operations  the company s cash flow and earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates by entering into short term foreign currency exchange contracts 
as of december   the company held short term contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency cash flows with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the company does not enter into any foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
contracts that effectively meet risk reduction and correlation criteria are accounted for as hedges  and accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are deferred in the cost basis of the underlying transaction 
in those circumstances when it is not appropriate to account for contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded currently in earnings 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at december  would not result in a material gain or loss 
additionally  any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  should be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item
